Spiegel, David, thank much here. - Andrew, pleasure. - Can tell
us, hypnosis? - Hypnosis state highly focused attention. something like
looking telephoto lens camera consciousness, see, see
great detail, devoid context. experience getting caught
good movie, forget watching movie enter imaginary
world. part movie, not part audience, experiencing it,
not evaluating it. hypnotic like experience many people
everyday lives. - So, experience really draws us in, hypnotic sense?
let give different example. watching sports game really wrapped
game, also touch makes feel body kind
registering excitement anticipation. state hypnosis also,
mentioned kind of, narrowing context. - Right. - kind losing
self, it, right? - Yes, true you're- [indistinct] extent

neck, yours, it, Spiegel. So, fun able learn
help people way just otherwise not done. so, got
thinking fact that, born brain don't user's manual

too. so, thought,

00:16:45 Stage Hypnosis

want understand better. want see can do. Stage hypnotists
drive nuts. make fools people. one. case father
involved. got call from, Columbia, got call, Spiegel, got
come see woman, ER. kind weird upset state
happened. turned show stage hypnotist who,
way is, cycle around, know, beginning show,
don't just grab somebody say, this. get bunch people up.
[indistinct] testing, see people- get ones

just gets off stage, 'cause upsetting. wandering around New

father saw her. still kind uncomfortable trance like state.
turned out, trophy wife wealthy guy. felt like bird
gilded cage. her, image just triggered sense of, dissatisfaction
discomfort, fear life. able get reoriented talk
going life. don't like stage hypnosis.
making fools people using fact, scares people
hypnosis. think losing control. gaining control. Self-hypnosis
way enhancing control, mind body. can work well,
gives kind cognitive flexibility, able shift sets easily.
give judging evaluating way usually see something
different point view. great therapeutic opportunity, misused,
danger too, scares people it. ability suspend
critical judgment just experience see happens. can
great therapeutic opportunity, somebody's misusing it, can way harm
people. plenty examples people, fantasies imposed them,
come think realities. not unusual days. So, ability that,
people learn recognize understand it, can tremendous therapeutic tool. -
stage hypnotized clinically hypnotized many times self-


hypnosis app. talk later. know plans hypnotize
today. done before. - Mm-hm. - [Andrew] hypnotizable
know. - Right. - talk about, one can gauge hypnotizability. - Sure.
- stage hypnosis, interesting. college, brought someone
dormitory and, recall one people selected. - Mm-hm. -
engaging bizarre behavior, right? wasn't thoroughly embarrassing,
pretty embarrassing. sent off stage, exiting, suddenly
screaming something planted suggestion sort. - Ah, mm-
hm. - told look pocket was, like a, think, torn
dollar bill. bunch things vague recollection of.

00:20:25 Neurobiology Hypnosis

- Mm-hm. raises set questions really boil to, biologist, always
think that, no events brain, processes. hypnosis, know
induction. one hypnotized, imagine. sounds like woman
example bird distraught New York City, failure exit
hypnotic state. know sorts brain areas active induction,
call deep hypnosis shutting off changing people exit
hypnosis. - Yes, do, studied that. interested that. so,
study selected highly non-hypnotizable people
comparison. hypnotize functional MRI scanner. found
three things characterized entry hypnotic state. first turning
activity dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. DACC central front-middle
part brain well know. part call salience network.
conflict detector. engaged work hear loud noise think
might gunshot, anterior cingulate cortex saying, hey, wait minute,
potential danger there. better pay attention it. So, compares
else going helps decide do.
can imagine, turning activity region, make less likely
distracted pulled whatever in. another study, found
highly hypnotizable people, even without hypnotized, functional
connectivity DACC, anterior cingulate cortex left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex. So, part key region executive control network. So,


engaging tasks, enacting plan, writing paper,
whatever doing. prefrontal cortex that. so,
coordinated, found functional connectivity. So, one up, other's
one down, other's down. coordination implies brain saying,
okay, go ahead, know doing. Carry plan. don't worry
possibilities. So, two things happen people hypnotized. One
DLPFC higher functional connectivity insula. Another part
salience network. part mind-body control system, sensitive
happening body. part pain network well, also region
brain where, can control things body wouldn't think could.
example, study years ago, took people highly
hypnotizable, hypnotized told them, went imaginary culinary tour. So,
eat favorite foods found that, increased gastric acid
secretion, like 87%. So, stomach acting though get,
mean, one woman, vivid halfway through, said,
stop, full, [laughs] eating imaginary- - never eaten- - never
eaten anything- - Actual food? - No. - Incredible. - got relax
think anything food drink. got like 40% decrease gastric acid
secretions. DLPFC insula, telling stomach getting
food not getting food. even, injected Pentagastrin,
triggers gastric acid release. even hypnosis condition, 19%
reduction gastric acid. So, brain amazing ability control going
body ways don't think ability control. just one
example. So, DLPFC insula connection. third thing happens,
relates stage, inverse functional connectivity
DLPFC posterior cingulate cortex. posterior cingulate part
default mode network. back brain. area whose activity goes
example, meditators. meditation, supposed selfless.
supposed to, [indistinct] self illusion, supposed let dissolve
just experience things. that, posterior cingulate decreasing
activity, inverse connection is, something not thinking
means me. may not even remember much it. do, don't care much
it. so, part dissociation occur hypnosis. So,
put things outside conscious awareness, don't worry means.


also adds cognitive flexibility. thinking, well, people like don't usually
this. may inhibit from, enacting new form psychotherapy example,
never done before. decreased activity part
brain reflects means, likely cognitively flexible
willing give try. one therapeutic advantages hypnosis well. -
Fascinating, really, going embarrass little bit. [David laughing]
positive sense, laboratory really one pioneered brain imaging
hypnotic states. And, sounds like it, understanding, correct? - Yeah,
mean, people, who've done excellent research too. - Sure. Pierre
Rainville Montreal several people,

00:26:04 ADHD

one leading labs neuroimaging hypnosis. - ask about,
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. get lot questions this. think lot
people just struggle holding attention nowadays, interference
phones devices. course, lot of, clinically legitimate ADHD there,
way describe, - Sure. - dorsal anterior cingulate salience
network conflict detector of, focusing something splitting
attention? distractable I? Seems relate extent activity
anterior cingulate cortex. people ADHD, display disruptions elements
networks hypnosis ever used to, self-hypnosis, be,
distinguish stage hypnosis, clinical self-hypnosis used enhance
people's ability focus hold attention? built component
hypnotic state. - great question. sort two ways think it,
terms enhancing focus, yes. helpful teaching people just prepare
mind narrow focus something. really engaged
reading something, writing pa- mean, that, sometimes thinking,
oh God, another hour. times hour will go think,
hey, great, that, feels game-like you, just assembling
parts puzzle putting 'em together. fun, just get absorbed,
me, hypnotic like experience, trouble, struggling,
sometimes things like self-hypnosis can help. not expert ADHD.
impression right, people constantly distracted


rather rigid. part easily distractable. upset
get distracted rather rigid want attend
can. think, way controlling this, distractibility, frankly. guess many
people ADHD, not hypnotizable, haven't studied it. So,
possible people disorder,

00:28:22 Hypnosis Stress & Sleep

training self-hypnosis might help, see hypnotizable
take there. - want return underlying neural networks
clinical applications but, sorts things aside asthma, used
hypnosis successfully others used clinical hypnosis for?
particular areas of, psychiatric challenges illnesses, guess called,
particularly amenable hypnotic treatment. - Yes, are. Hypnosis good
problem focused treatment. oldest western conception psychotherapy,
can used specific problems way helpful. found helpful
stress reduction. helping people deal, dealing stress days.
helpful, mind-body connection helpful part problem
stress perception. mentioned earlier sort good sense,
football game something, feel physical reaction. can reinforcing
thing. Wow, exciting, it. can also distracting. So, worried
getting COVID worried about, physical problem have.
notice body, body tenses up, start sweat. sympathetic
nervous system goes, heart rate goes up. notice think, oh
God, really bad. feel worse. So, like snowball rolling downhill.
feel worse body gets worse. Hypnosis can helpful
dissociating somatic reaction psychological reactions. So, teach people
imagine body floating somewhere safe comfortable like bath, lake, hot tub
floating space, picture problem stressing imaginary
screen, rule, no matter see screen, keep body
comfortable. So, point, still can't control stress, can control
physical reaction it. starts feeling control. least one
thing can manage. can use think visualize one
thing might stressor. So, hypnosis helpful controlling mind-


body interaction relation stress. helpful people get sleep.
lot fun that. getting emails people said, haven't slept right
15 years, now first time, listening app can sleep night.
helpful again, wake middle night, tell people, don't
look clock. arousal cue. wake more, picture whatever
thinking worrying imaginary screen body
floating. So, watch movie, keep body floating. many people can
use get back sleep. - using self-hypnosis sleep long time.
now Reveri app, talk relationship Reveri app
uses. find incredibly useful falling back asleep middle night.
raises question, found think understand correctly, one can self-
hypnosis daytime. issue comes later, like,
instance, self-hypnosis stress reduction, away stressful event prepare
one deal stress better. - Right. - hypnosis improving return sleep.
can done actually want go sleep. kind training
networks,

00:32:12 Hypnosis Strengthen Neural Connections

right? - right. - So, evidence that, brain networks actually form
stronger connections, people self-hypnosis time? - Well, rule
neurobiology know, neurons fire together wire together. - friend,
Carla Shatz. - Yes, Carla- - Not Donald Hebb, way. [David laughing] keep trying
to, widespread myth world unfortunately, internet,
that, fire together wire together said by, psychologist, Donald Hebb
Donald Hebb many important things, neurobiologist Carla Shatz- -
exactly right. - Who, Yes, Stanford also Berkeley Harvard. So, also
decent schools. - exactly right. - Stanford, said, fire together wire
together. deserves, - Right. - credit statement. Yeah,
repeated use self-hypnosis, one imagine networks getting
stronger. - think so. don't evidence yet, long term
potentiation provides pathway described program, number
times allow repeated activation network actually build new connections
work. least, even learning memory point view, memory


network associations. remember things. example like
give is, go back grade school see little tiny lockers
size wrong. suddenly flood memories obviously stored
there, just didn't think of. So, context association memory's about.
start acquire memories problem. So, one thing use hypnosis
treating phobias, example. problem people phobias, like
airplane phobias crossing bridge high, avoid
more, source associations memories fear. don't
good experiences 'cause avoid it. like get back horse fall
off kind thing. hypnosis, can start people able manage anxiety
enough can more, wider array experiences, start
network associations isn't negative may even positive. - almost
like a, sorry interrupt, ask. - Sure - almost like a, exposure therapy
done mind. - Yes. - always mind. mean, even exposure to,
snake phobia, don't, don't like snakes, don't think qualifies full
blown phobia. think healthy fear snakes. - Yeah. - if, say
snake phobia, typical approach in, be, cognitive behavioral approaches, right,
show picture snake, rubber snake, real snake.
Eventually person is, - Yeah. - holding boa constrictor something like that. -
[David] Right. - mind translate nervous system
signals. hypnosis, sounds like can give number positive experiences
without use props, without bring animals room. - Right,
I- - Drive someone across bridge, right? - Yes, woman,
successful business woman, high level corporation. terrible dog phobia.
imagine somebody brought dog room said, "what
doing?" see getting tense. said, "Well, waiting
see dog does." said, "If somebody works you, comes
office, freeze wait see did?" said, "Of course not,
tell 'em do." [laughs] said, "Well, immobilizing yourself, power
isn't dog you, so, imagine might engage dog
help control situation." said, "Thanks." reminds of, one
favorite stories hypnosis that, father seeing woman lived
Midtown Manhattan horrible dog phobia. dropped things, spill
coffee saw dog. time trips store, thought


least likely people walking dogs. - Now wouldn't possible, everyone
in- - [laughs] Everyone New York dog - like fleet French Bulldogs, -
Right, exactly. - taking New York City. - So, taught think dog
friend, neighbor dog, bring dog hold dog collar
make sure, gradually able stroke dog say, dog friend
distinguish wild tame animals. animals, afraid
[murmurs]. So, seemed better. called back three months later
asked her. "Well, calling?" son said. said, "Dr. Spiegel."
boy said, "That's weird." father said, "What's weird?" said, "Spiegel's
heat." bought dog, - love it. - named it, Spiegel. - love it. - Talk
transference. - love it. [David laughing]

00:37:19 Restructuring Trauma Narratives

really speaks power this. brings back issue. So,
different about, father case woman, terms
happened hypnosis allowed go completely terrified dogs
owning dog naming father? find amusing. - Yeah. -
different just two sitting talking it, right? know,
therapy, narrative huge component. - Right. - hypnosis narrative huge
component. - Right. - must that, brain state really different.
talk trauma minutes. think people trauma
phobias, certainly conversation it. might freeze up.
might lose articulation forth. different
state combines narrative, think allow underlying neural networks
engage change? 'Cause find fascinating a- Every attempt
dealing stress phobia clinical setting involves discussion
is. - Yes. - But, not talking medication introduced,
least not particular circumstances. - Right. - So, realize kind obvious
question like, difference brain activity, find incredible.
control variable brain state. not, spoken. - raising
couple important issues, Andrew. talked earlier systematic
desensitization, sort lay hierarchy things one time.
think unsystematic desensitization, changing mental states.


think evidence mental state change
therapeutic potential. seeing ketamine treating depression,
dissociogenic drug. know every morning wake up, problem,
know, made mistake reading nasty email 11:00 PM. didn't know
do. wake morning thinking, oh, idiot, yeah,
going do. So, just changing mental state, therapeutic potential. think
underestimate ability regulate change responses cognitively,
emotionally somatically flexible. so, things, right, follow similar
principles facing problem, seeing different point view. done
really, nice podcast trauma stress expose it,
not avoid it, talked before. find way reconnect it,
substitute something can make feel good, rather bad, activate
centers brain like mesolimbic reward system. so, hypnosis
can much faster. People don't think can can.
having, right now physical experience, thinking not feeling
bad used to. can powerful thing can hypnosis. So,
woman came see me, suffered attempted rape. getting dark,
coming back grocery store guy grabs wants get
apartment. outside apartment. starts fighting
winds basilar skull fracture. runs away. cops come, since hadn't
raped, left, weren't interested. wanted use hypnosis get
better image guy looked like, painful, upsetting thing. So,
quite hypnotizable. got floating. say, safe comfortable, now, nothing
can happen will harm body. left side screen, want
picture guy approaching happening. said, really,
light, getting dark. really can't see much facial features, recognize
something, hadn't allowed remember. gets upstairs, doesn't just
want rape me, going kill me. so, ways, seeing
even worse. So, thinking, good, Spiegel, made even frightened
before. pointed PTSD stress lecture, got
confront trauma, restructure understanding it. So, side
screen, picture, protect yourself? everybody
trauma situation engages strategy self protection. salience network
kicking in. said, "You know what?" surprised fighting hard.


didn't think would. so, realized one hand even worse
thought was. hand actually probably saved life.
so, way of, helping restructure experience trauma make
tolerable. helped her- didn't recog- couldn't identify guy,
helped restructure understand experience. something
can just talking, straight psychotherapy. sometimes can hell
lot faster efficiently using hypnosis. one randomized trial
Israel shows adding hypnosis PTSD treatment, actually improves
outcome. way accomplishing things understand broader
psychotherapy world, much quickly sometimes effectively. - Yeah,
sounds like going somewhat state one trying deal with,
dissociating state key. imagine, open
various podcasts. done lot analysis years. experienced
sessions, depending show them, might just get kind
laundry list happened opposed actually feeling anything, around
happened. - Right. - think people probably vary extent can
drop feeling states can depend day. can depend well
slept night on. - one thing might add, Andrew, - Yes. -
is, notion late Gordon Bower, just memorial Gordon
Stanford. died year ago. Brilliant cognitive psychologist, one founders
cognitive psychology Stanford great pitcher. almost became Major
League pitcher decided go grad school instead, glad did.
Gordon helped establish concept state dependent memory
certain mental state, enhance ability remember things it. sort
bad example drunk hides bottle can't remember
put gets drunk mental state. People go
dissociative states traumatized. way, hypnosis helping
remember deal memories better mental state
like happened. rape victims will tell you, floating
body, feeling sorry woman assaulted below. People traumatic
episodes, just say, know, blank out, don't know happening,
autopilot kind self hypnotic state. So, use hypnosis help
deal traumatic memory, making state in, right office
you, congruent state likely in, trauma happened.


think part helps facilitate treatment trauma related disorders. -
see.

00:45:14 Ketamine Therapy

makes ask, every question ask, 'cause really feel
almost like compulsion, dissociation traumatic episode is, part
adaptive strategy. - Right. - creates certain issues, creates problems, right?
something like ketamine, creates dissociative state, useful
treatment trauma? confused days colleague,
Karl Deisseroth, also podcast coworkers figured out,
okay, layer one networks neocortex, involved
dissociative state. starting gain understanding ketamine
works neural level. - Right. - seem, certain populations can
useful treatment. don't know, never tried it. don't know current status
is, legal. allowed least in, FDA approved use.
dissociative states useful element dissociation gave rise
trauma memory first place? - Well, yeah, Karl brilliant paper
nature he, rats humans one paper. showed
rhythmic discharge retrosplenial region, triggered ketamine.
rats actually showed dissociative like behavior, hot pad
ordinarily wouldn't didn't seem much pain paw.
male subject implanted electrodes- - Human, yeah. - human subject, yeah.
electrodes picked rhythmic activity. did,
report dissociative state. description was, like pilot
airplane. felt walking cockpit plane still flying
and- - sounds terrifying me. [David laughing] sounds terrify terrifying. -
thing- - want body, [David laughing] time, know. -
right but, point is, way principal, Andrew, like, principle said,
need re-confront traumatic situation can modulate associations
it. So, accept it, accept arousal, put boundaries around
figure can approach problem approach
problem different point view. So, not surprise- fact, studied,
people disassociated Loma Prieta earthquake Oakland-Berkeley


firestorm. - remember well. - Yeah. - Earthquakes follow me. move
south Northridge quake- - going keep away So, there'll one
later, afternoon. [David laughing] - starting dissociating. So, dissociation
compartmentalize experience, means point view treating trauma,
inhibition. don't engage it. like happened there. think
happens people, sometimes good able separate
recollection. somewhere. sight not mind.
effects you, can't deal it. can't reprocess it. think
one reason ketamine might work fact, allows keep, re-approach
dissociative experience way can start think something
it. just fact can turn off. also self-hypnosis
helpful. not something just comes happens you.
something can make happen. can control it, can something it. So,
feel less helpless control. essence trauma helplessness. not
fear, not pain. helplessness. become object. become just body.
don't control going on. not used that. discussed
breathing paper anticipation breathing. not whether breathe, inhale
exhale hold breath, think can inhale can't,
really upsetting, understandably. so, issue control hypnosis,
terrible reputation taking away control actually superb way enhancing
control mind body. - love reminds naming important.
almost wonder self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis called something
else, would've separated stage hypnosis way make
less scary, weird, complicated people embrace. But, - Yeah. - part reason
discussion is, great experiences hypnosis, seen
data, talking lot clinical examples. incredibly powerful boils
right neural brain states. - Right. - And,

00:50:07 Self-directed Hypnosis, Reveri

think years come, going become widespread along lines.
quickly, described examples people getting relief quickly. -
Right. - permanent, changes? need follow related
that, sure number people listening thinking, wonderful, love


get hypnotized number different things Dr. Spiegel somebody else expert
clinical hypnosis, might not access somebody similar
training. power? So, quickly work? long lasting
changes? then, necessary work clinical hypnotist? better
self-hypnosis forth? Maybe just give us contour
landscape directed self-directed treatment. - Well, typically, people
start coming see clinician like me. better see someone licensing
training professional discipline, medicine, psychology, dentistry, whatever. -
'Cause lot hypnotists there, just hypnotist. - Right. Just
hypnotists. - Oh, okay. - key issue is, somebody can really assess
problem make sure not, talking someone reducing chest
pain, rather getting coronary artery problem- - 'Cause real
issue there. - could, right. - hypnosis might adjust wouldn't deal
deeper underlying issue. - right. hand. typically use
people, often see twice periodically, not every week.
certainly not every day, pain problem hypnosis helpful pain.
so, is, identifying hypnotizable are. give standard
brief test ability experience hypnosis, going self-hypnosis
exercise deal problem, seeing respond it,
teaching themselves. old days, used use
iPhone record part session. play back hypnosis

stop smoking. elements take 15 minutes elements just
take one two minutes people can refresh reinforce. - Two minute hypnosis,
[indistinct] one minute. - Yes. - Yeah. - one two, one two minutes
now, finding two thirds people find even just one minute
refresher, helps feel better. reporting, feel better. So, nice thing is,
know right away, whether likely help not. found, done
studies, looking hypnosis pain relief acute medical procedures.

00:56:53 Eliminating Obsessive Thoughts, Superstitions

- Great, thanks clarification. hopefully, time both, get asked lot
obsessive thoughts intrusive thoughts. also get asked lot OCD.
evidence hypnosis self-hypnosis can used for, dealing obsessive
thoughts? - Sometimes, obsessional people, just turn not
hypnotizable for, yeah, not random. tend controlling
thought, busy evaluating rather experiencing, so- - know people
like that. [David laughing] sounds like adaptive mindset lot professions. -
right. - get trained that, - Yeah. - school, obsess
exam, obsess the, - Yeah. - social interactions. mean, part
becoming functional human being. yet, can take us different- -
sometimes overdo it. mean, tell one example extreme situations, that,
know, judging, evaluating, not letting experience, including
emotionally. know somebody, listens tapes airplanes go down. So,
get black box listen it. said me, know- -
profession recreational- - No, profession. - Okay. -
did. 'Cause trying accident prevention handle things.
said worry people panicking, right? guys know
got 30 seconds 45 seconds just going
checklist. said, don't panic enough. taught do.
reason, good reason it. sometimes overdo it. painful
listen 'cause know going happen. So, kind balance
hit. sometimes get emotional absorbed not
enough sort see possibilities. can problem.
hand, sometimes rigid controlled don't let emotions guide
need protect protect others. So, say


general people OCD are, less hypnotizable side spectrum,
less likely allow engage any, typical example checking
OCD example, don't remember, whether locked door turned off
gas oven keep going back keep checking. So,
evaluative component brain, kind overrides experiential one sometimes
people can get benefit, not group select
likely respond self hypnotic approaches. - superstitions similar? -
Superstitions, think more, people hypnotizable, keep
getting caught things like superstitions there, imagination supplants
reality. seen lot happening recently. think there,
possible helped learning sort see put context, see
different point view. - developed pretty vicious superstition,
college hard break, actually. always feel, talk clinicians,
reveal certain things pathology. - Please do. - so- - get
bill later. - Thank you, yes, part reason arranged this. [David laughing] No,
just kidding. yeah, did. habit knocking wood things noticed
started to, sneak knocking wood every 'cause didn't want
people think often. started realize that, becoming
little bit reflex. saw incredible video Bence Olveczky's lab

start introduce behaviors nothing actual lever
pressing, like start scratching hind quarters things like that. hat,

pitcher throwing baseball. this, - Oh, yeah. - start incorporate
motor behaviors unrelated outcome, mind somehow starts think
necessary outcome. incorporate it. So, decided
break simply forcing not week. - Mm-hm. just
seemed like ridiculous, - [Both] thing do. Yeah, well- - Knock wood. - call
response prevention works. is, set new context
brain, get outcome want, devoid extraneous behavior. - Yeah,
knew nuts, right. knew illogical. - Right.

01:01:50 ‘Hypnotizability’, Spiegel Eye-roll Test



- somehow things take meaning. - [David] Right. - So, talked about,
utility hypnosis stress reduction, phobias, pain, possibly, don't know for,
things like ADHD OCD, just will depend hypnotizability. - Right. - talked
beautiful study the, metastatic breast cancer outcome patients.
Hypnotizability clearly key variable. - Yes. - please tell us,
hypnotizability is, evaluated Spiegel Eye-Roll Test is? - Okay,
sure. So, hypnotizability just capacity hypnotic experiences.
test called hypnotic conduction profile. give highly structured hypnotic
experience. old tradition clinical hypnosis was, try bunch
different things, talking, walking upstairs downstairs images time
say breathing subject that. change
clinician, less can make variation outcome. take
long time, know, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. just view kind complex,
not effective way assessing person's hypnotic capacity. know
peak period hypnotizability human life, latency years childhood. So,
every eight year old trance time. call 'em dinner, don't
hear ya, thing. childhood wonderful
experience. Work play thing. try make little
adults, think terrible mistake. Everything fun them. enjoy learning,
enjoy everything. - age this- - like 6 10, 6 11.
playful, enjoy everything. Everything sort game fun try
make miserable them, got it. when, Piaget called,
adult cognitive framework, learn abstract concepts, learn even one
bottle looks bigger other, can equal volume. so, imposing
logic, growing DLPFC point imposing cognitive structure
experience. people start lose hypnotic ability. time
early 20s, hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed. study done
Stanford, Ernest Hillard, Phil Zimbardo this, looking at, tracked
students psych one, hypnotizability measured retested
blindly 25 years later. test, retest correlation was, want guess
was? - guessing it's, don't know, 0.6 something. - Yeah, close. 0.7, IQ
0.6, 25 year interval. - Wow. - So, stable IQ 25
year interval. So, point, are. factors


lead that? Well, means that, third adults just
not hypnotizable. Two thirds are, 15% extremely hypnotizable can
measure give number 0 10. useful.
patients it, say, look, sorry, not hypnotizable going
something else. Medication, systematic desensitization, mindfulness, things
hypnotizable, just go it. don't lot explaining. People
low moderate hypnotizable, like explanations doing,
can still get benefits. So, helps guide nature treatment
people. Now, eye roll is, father used use eye fixation induction, used
say, look ceiling now close eyes looking up. very,
yes, very- - Yeah [indistinct] [laughs]. - noticed two patients back
back. one woman seen work with, hysterical seizures.
just suddenly start shaking. And- - Real epileptic seizures? - No, pseudo
epileptic seizures. - see, hysteria. - Hysteria, although people both,
the, people, real epilepsy becomes framework gets elaborated on,
stressed, seizures. just pseudo epilepsy, no EEG
abnormalities. really something watch. husband move
work bench near door, started seizure, run home
try help it. bad. noticed
did, looked up, one seizure events, see
sclera, don't see Iris anymore. start seize. great thing
her. taught seizures. Everybody else telling stop.
made one. hypnotized her, [indistinct] go back last time
one sure enough, start shake. gradually make smaller
smaller. So, learning control, access, like
PTSD, confront, don't avoid it, don't suppress it. confront figure
deal it. next patient rigid obsessional businessman
wanted stop controlling [chuckles], reminded me,
New Yorker cartoon driver, comes yield sign yells, "Never!"
always [indistinct]. - sounds right, New Yorker. - Yeah, New
Yorker. so, guy, tried look up, couldn't keep eyes
closed them. so, father started testing people. seemed
rough correlation capacity keep eyes up, closed
measured hypnotizability. - people listening [stutters], watching


video. So, Spiegel Eye-Roll Test, involves looking ceiling. So, tilting
head back, tilting chin back looking ceiling now. also
directing eyes upward eyes open. eye roll test involves
then, closing eyelids eyes open. - open. - whether not,
eyes roll back said it, see sclera, white part. - see sclera,
white part. - means you're, hypnotizable moderately hypnotizable. -
Right. - Whereas eyes move see iris, colored part eye
eyes close, less hypnotizable. - Right. - can look online there, just
put Spiegel Eye-Roll Test find it. also going actual
example hypnosis video later. - Right. So, asking brain something
difficult, keep eyes closing eyelids. contradictory signals
third, fourth sixth cranial nerve nuclei control eye movement. - said
third- - Fourth six, - Yup. - cranial nerve nuclei. suspending one
activity, asking another eye movements lot levels
consciousness. periaqueductal gray, surrounds cranial nerve nuclei.
close eyes sleep, rapid eye movement dream.
drugs, affect level consciousness, can affect eyes eye movements,
either dilation contraction pupils, depending whether stimulant
opioid. - Stimulants, make pupils big. - Big, right? - Yeah. Like cocaine,
amphetamine. - Right, exactly. - Things sort. - opioids, get constricted
pupils. - parents looking kids coming door late night,
looking substance abuse. - right. - Yeah. - So, something
eyes lot level consciousness. mean, obviously, close
eyes go sleep, rapid eye movement dreaming.
So, not surprising. old Zen practice called, looking third eye.
think part reason happens is, looking inside like
third eye two forehead. think
visual creatures, pretty pathetic physical point view. Many animals
can outrun us, outs smell us eagles read newsprint hundred yards
can't. So, major defensive sensory input vision. animals,
predator animals eyes front head, good,
detailed vision prey. Whereas prey animals like deer, eyes side
head. So, don't see things well, much bigger range potential
see threat. mainly use, fact, interesting, social


anthropologists say, gather do, coastlines edge
forest something, got protection back. Something can
attack one side big vision might threaten you.
tend attracted kinds physical situations, so- - Yeah, love vistas. -
love vistas, right. - Vistas calming. take us panoramic

location national parks people naturally aggregated was-
makes sense. - Sure. - But, signs locations built around, people's
tendency animals tendencies. - Oh, really [indistinct]? - aggregate there. Yeah,
interesting book history national parks says, didn't
give research study support it, no Google Maps, obviously. -
interesting. - Yeah, panorama visual boundaries really interesting. think,
eyes, know, two pieces central nervous system brain,
outside the- - Right. used say eyes outside skull neuro-
ophthalmologist wrote vehemently pointed outside

isn't neuroanatomy course maybe go little deeper there. So, said
contradictory activity, looking controlled one set cranial nerves.
closing eyelids, controlled another cranial nerve. - No,
one. think six close eyes, activate, no, facial,
guess facial nerve. 7, yeah. - 7, yeah. - looking up, activating
muscles force eyes look up. closing eyelids normally relaxes
those, relaxes upper movement, eyes closed don't
need it. breaking usual customary pattern. - like rubbing the, -
Right. - hey, can't even it, see like the, - Right. [Andrew David laughing] -
exactly right. - Rubbing tummy patting head. bit
conflict there, - Right. - clinically, good probe you, - has. -
father. So, Spiegel senior Spiegel junior? - Spiegel senior. -
developed Spiegel Eye-Roll Test. - key issue this, normally
close eyes also, going sleep. not worried going
world anymore. Here, maintaining resting alertness. So, focusing
turning inward. unusual state. Normally close eyes periodically,
to, close eyes period time, normally go


sleep not worried detecting risk threat. So, interesting state
turning inward, basically, looking up, shutting eyes
allowing whatever happens outside happen focusing
going inward. So, think signal brain turn inward. - interesting.
meditation course, done eyes open almost always done
eyes closed. - Yes, right. - interesting. So, can quickly determine
whether not someone highly hypnotizable. - Right. - not hypnotizable.
said two thirds people can hypnotized. - Right. - Obviously third cannot.
within two thirds can, range, said 15% people fall
this, highly hypnotizable category. - Right, correct. - seem member
of. - Yeah. - And, repeated use self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis, increase
change hypnotizability, can access first place? - say
general, may increase little bit, not hell lot, not worth effort
increase hypnotizability point. worth trying deal problem,
dealing with. So, can get better using level have.
study done tried train people hypnotizable
obviously, there're subjective behavioral components test, can learn
little better them. found reanalyze data,
account three times final score, based initial hypnotizability
measurement, rather whether not trained better. So,
can improve little

01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)

not worth trouble. - Got it. Along lines eyes eye movements, lot
interest EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. -
Shapiro working, wasn't Stanford directly, local
Stanford. - Yeah. - think Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - thoughts
EMDR? useful, think less useful? things
EMDR combined make useful? listeners podcast
come to, think, come podcast range backgrounds interests. me,
makes sense EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given newer
data can suppress amygdala activity animals animal models
humans well. really hasn't explored much, neurally. heard things like,


coordinates two sides brain, it, just throwaway. don't think
evidence that, coordinating two sides brain better not
coordinating. wouldn't speaking right now two sides brain, well
correlated. - Yeah. - language lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - heard
mimics, rapid eye movements sleep, actually doesn't. So, - Right. -
heard people talk positive experiences EMDR.
thoughts EMDR? - Yeah, good comment one recent
podcasts. tell you, one way sort think bemused point view,
old, mentioned earlier, oldest sort idea hypnotic induction,
dangling watch, right? [indistinct] watch. And, fact, enough concern
automobiles invented, movement prevent

watched windshield wipers go back forth car. Now, turns
fortunately that, tend not look windshield wipers. keep looking

think, combination exposure based treatments, use
EMDR think it. tend not process experience much just

things. So, tend think that, EMDR another form exposure based therapy
trauma, implied exception possible new data, certainly
doesn't with, rapid eye movement sleep. don't think moving eyes
issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face

part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put
weight this, going re-injure ankle example, simply mean
body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat
something coming opportunity something ameliorate situation. So,
not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding
happening. face also say, opportunity

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body
floating, safe comfortable. Now, picture Mary sit feeling sadness
no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,

Spiegel, David, thank much here. - Andrew, pleasure. - Can tell
us, hypnosis? - Hypnosis state highly focused attention. something like
looking telephoto lens camera consciousness, see, see
great detail, devoid context. experience getting caught
good movie, forget watching movie enter imaginary
world. part movie, not part audience, experiencing it,
not evaluating it. hypnotic like experience many people
everyday lives. - So, experience really draws us in, hypnotic sense?
let give different example. watching sports game really wrapped
game, also touch makes feel body kind
registering excitement anticipation. state hypnosis also,
mentioned kind of, narrowing context. - Right. - kind losing
self, it, right? - Yes, true you're- [indistinct] extent
somatic, body experience part sport event

like, more, just one series experiences. - Okay. ask,
get business hypnosis? Because, think people, hear

breath take will little deeper little easier. within five minutes,
lying back bed. knuckles aren't white, not wheezing. mother
stopped crying. nurse ran room, intern, intern comes find
figured going pat back say, nice job, Spiegel. said,
nurse filed complaint nursing supervisor violated
Massachusetts law hypnotizing, minor without parental consent. thought, oh,
nice. doubt law like this. So, interns says, going

too. so, thought,

00:16:45 Stage Hypnosis

want understand better. want see can do. Stage hypnotists
drive nuts. make fools people. one. case father
involved. got call from, Columbia, got call, Spiegel, got
come see woman, ER. kind weird upset state
happened. turned show stage hypnotist who,
way is, cycle around, know, beginning show,
don't just grab somebody say, this. get bunch people up.
[indistinct] testing, see people- get ones
hypnotizable. one. said, now little bird
hand, going play bird. starts cry scream.
just gets off stage, 'cause upsetting. wandering around New
York City middle night dissociated brought Columbia.
father saw her. still kind uncomfortable trance like state.
turned out, trophy wife wealthy guy. felt like bird
gilded cage. her, image just triggered sense of, dissatisfaction
discomfort, fear life. able get reoriented talk
going life. don't like stage hypnosis.
making fools people using fact, scares people
hypnosis. think losing control. gaining control. Self-hypnosis
way enhancing control, mind body. can work well,
gives kind cognitive flexibility, able shift sets easily.
give judging evaluating way usually see something
different point view. great therapeutic opportunity, misused,
danger too, scares people it. ability suspend
critical judgment just experience see happens. can
great therapeutic opportunity, somebody's misusing it, can way harm
people. plenty examples people, fantasies imposed them,
come think realities. not unusual days. So, ability that,
people learn recognize understand it, can tremendous therapeutic tool. -
stage hypnotized clinically hypnotized many times self-


hypnosis app. talk later. know plans hypnotize
today. done before. - Mm-hm. - [Andrew] hypnotizable
know. - Right. - talk about, one can gauge hypnotizability. - Sure.
- stage hypnosis, interesting. college, brought someone
dormitory and, recall one people selected. - Mm-hm. -
engaging bizarre behavior, right? wasn't thoroughly embarrassing,
pretty embarrassing. sent off stage, exiting, suddenly
screaming something planted suggestion sort. - Ah, mm-
hm. - told look pocket was, like a, think, torn
dollar bill. bunch things vague recollection of.

00:20:25 Neurobiology Hypnosis

- Mm-hm. raises set questions really boil to, biologist, always
think that, no events brain, processes. hypnosis, know
induction. one hypnotized, imagine. sounds like woman
example bird distraught New York City, failure exit
hypnotic state. know sorts brain areas active induction,
call deep hypnosis shutting off changing people exit
hypnosis. - Yes, do, studied that. interested that. so,
study selected highly non-hypnotizable people
comparison. hypnotize functional MRI scanner. found
three things characterized entry hypnotic state. first turning
activity dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. DACC central front-middle
part brain well know. part call salience network.
conflict detector. engaged work hear loud noise think
might gunshot, anterior cingulate cortex saying, hey, wait minute,
potential danger there. better pay attention it. So, compares
else going helps decide do.
can imagine, turning activity region, make less likely
distracted pulled whatever in. another study, found
highly hypnotizable people, even without hypnotized, functional
connectivity DACC, anterior cingulate cortex left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex. So, part key region executive control network. So,


engaging tasks, enacting plan, writing paper,
whatever doing. prefrontal cortex that. so,
coordinated, found functional connectivity. So, one up, other's
one down, other's down. coordination implies brain saying,
okay, go ahead, know doing. Carry plan. don't worry
possibilities. So, two things happen people hypnotized. One
DLPFC higher functional connectivity insula. Another part
salience network. part mind-body control system, sensitive
happening body. part pain network well, also region
brain where, can control things body wouldn't think could.
example, study years ago, took people highly
hypnotizable, hypnotized told them, went imaginary culinary tour. So,
eat favorite foods found that, increased gastric acid
secretion, like 87%. So, stomach acting though get,
mean, one woman, vivid halfway through, said,
stop, full, [laughs] eating imaginary- - never eaten- - never
eaten anything- - Actual food? - No. - Incredible. - got relax
think anything food drink. got like 40% decrease gastric acid
secretions. DLPFC insula, telling stomach getting
food not getting food. even, injected Pentagastrin,
triggers gastric acid release. even hypnosis condition, 19%
reduction gastric acid. So, brain amazing ability control going
body ways don't think ability control. just one
example. So, DLPFC insula connection. third thing happens,
relates stage, inverse functional connectivity
DLPFC posterior cingulate cortex. posterior cingulate part
default mode network. back brain. area whose activity goes
example, meditators. meditation, supposed selfless.
supposed to, [indistinct] self illusion, supposed let dissolve
just experience things. that, posterior cingulate decreasing
activity, inverse connection is, something not thinking
means me. may not even remember much it. do, don't care much
it. so, part dissociation occur hypnosis. So,
put things outside conscious awareness, don't worry means.


also adds cognitive flexibility. thinking, well, people like don't usually
this. may inhibit from, enacting new form psychotherapy example,
never done before. decreased activity part
brain reflects means, likely cognitively flexible
willing give try. one therapeutic advantages hypnosis well. -
Fascinating, really, going embarrass little bit. [David laughing]
positive sense, laboratory really one pioneered brain imaging
hypnotic states. And, sounds like it, understanding, correct? - Yeah,
mean, people, who've done excellent research too. - Sure. Pierre
Rainville Montreal several people,

00:26:04 ADHD

one leading labs neuroimaging hypnosis. - ask about,
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. get lot questions this. think lot
people just struggle holding attention nowadays, interference
phones devices. course, lot of, clinically legitimate ADHD there,
way describe, - Sure. - dorsal anterior cingulate salience
network conflict detector of, focusing something splitting
attention? distractable I? Seems relate extent activity
anterior cingulate cortex. people ADHD, display disruptions elements
networks hypnosis ever used to, self-hypnosis, be,
distinguish stage hypnosis, clinical self-hypnosis used enhance
people's ability focus hold attention? built component
hypnotic state. - great question. sort two ways think it,
terms enhancing focus, yes. helpful teaching people just prepare
mind narrow focus something. really engaged
reading something, writing pa- mean, that, sometimes thinking,
oh God, another hour. times hour will go think,
hey, great, that, feels game-like you, just assembling
parts puzzle putting 'em together. fun, just get absorbed,
me, hypnotic like experience, trouble, struggling,
sometimes things like self-hypnosis can help. not expert ADHD.
impression right, people constantly distracted


rather rigid. part easily distractable. upset
get distracted rather rigid want attend
can. think, way controlling this, distractibility, frankly. guess many
people ADHD, not hypnotizable, haven't studied it. So,
possible people disorder,

00:28:22 Hypnosis Stress & Sleep

training self-hypnosis might help, see hypnotizable
take there. - want return underlying neural networks
clinical applications but, sorts things aside asthma, used
hypnosis successfully others used clinical hypnosis for?
particular areas of, psychiatric challenges illnesses, guess called,
particularly amenable hypnotic treatment. - Yes, are. Hypnosis good
problem focused treatment. oldest western conception psychotherapy,
can used specific problems way helpful. found helpful
stress reduction. helping people deal, dealing stress days.
helpful, mind-body connection helpful part problem
stress perception. mentioned earlier sort good sense,
football game something, feel physical reaction. can reinforcing
thing. Wow, exciting, it. can also distracting. So, worried
getting COVID worried about, physical problem have.
notice body, body tenses up, start sweat. sympathetic
nervous system goes, heart rate goes up. notice think, oh
God, really bad. feel worse. So, like snowball rolling downhill.
feel worse body gets worse. Hypnosis can helpful
dissociating somatic reaction psychological reactions. So, teach people
imagine body floating somewhere safe comfortable like bath, lake, hot tub
floating space, picture problem stressing imaginary
screen, rule, no matter see screen, keep body
comfortable. So, point, still can't control stress, can control
physical reaction it. starts feeling control. least one
thing can manage. can use think visualize one
thing might stressor. So, hypnosis helpful controlling mind-


body interaction relation stress. helpful people get sleep.
lot fun that. getting emails people said, haven't slept right
15 years, now first time, listening app can sleep night.
helpful again, wake middle night, tell people, don't
look clock. arousal cue. wake more, picture whatever
thinking worrying imaginary screen body
floating. So, watch movie, keep body floating. many people can
use get back sleep. - using self-hypnosis sleep long time.
now Reveri app, talk relationship Reveri app
uses. find incredibly useful falling back asleep middle night.
raises question, found think understand correctly, one can self-
hypnosis daytime. issue comes later, like,
instance, self-hypnosis stress reduction, away stressful event prepare
one deal stress better. - Right. - hypnosis improving return sleep.
can done actually want go sleep. kind training
networks,

00:32:12 Hypnosis Strengthen Neural Connections

right? - right. - So, evidence that, brain networks actually form
stronger connections, people self-hypnosis time? - Well, rule
neurobiology know, neurons fire together wire together. - friend,
Carla Shatz. - Yes, Carla- - Not Donald Hebb, way. [David laughing] keep trying
to, widespread myth world unfortunately, internet,
that, fire together wire together said by, psychologist, Donald Hebb
Donald Hebb many important things, neurobiologist Carla Shatz- -
exactly right. - Who, Yes, Stanford also Berkeley Harvard. So, also
decent schools. - exactly right. - Stanford, said, fire together wire
together. deserves, - Right. - credit statement. Yeah,
repeated use self-hypnosis, one imagine networks getting
stronger. - think so. don't evidence yet, long term
potentiation provides pathway described program, number
times allow repeated activation network actually build new connections
work. least, even learning memory point view, memory


network associations. remember things. example like
give is, go back grade school see little tiny lockers
size wrong. suddenly flood memories obviously stored
there, just didn't think of. So, context association memory's about.
start acquire memories problem. So, one thing use hypnosis
treating phobias, example. problem people phobias, like
airplane phobias crossing bridge high, avoid
more, source associations memories fear. don't
good experiences 'cause avoid it. like get back horse fall
off kind thing. hypnosis, can start people able manage anxiety
enough can more, wider array experiences, start
network associations isn't negative may even positive. - almost
like a, sorry interrupt, ask. - Sure - almost like a, exposure therapy
done mind. - Yes. - always mind. mean, even exposure to,
snake phobia, don't, don't like snakes, don't think qualifies full
blown phobia. think healthy fear snakes. - Yeah. - if, say
snake phobia, typical approach in, be, cognitive behavioral approaches, right,
show picture snake, rubber snake, real snake.
Eventually person is, - Yeah. - holding boa constrictor something like that. -
[David] Right. - mind translate nervous system
signals. hypnosis, sounds like can give number positive experiences
without use props, without bring animals room. - Right,
I- - Drive someone across bridge, right? - Yes, woman,
successful business woman, high level corporation. terrible dog phobia.
imagine somebody brought dog room said, "what
doing?" see getting tense. said, "Well, waiting
see dog does." said, "If somebody works you, comes
office, freeze wait see did?" said, "Of course not,
tell 'em do." [laughs] said, "Well, immobilizing yourself, power
isn't dog you, so, imagine might engage dog
help control situation." said, "Thanks." reminds of, one
favorite stories hypnosis that, father seeing woman lived
Midtown Manhattan horrible dog phobia. dropped things, spill
coffee saw dog. time trips store, thought


least likely people walking dogs. - Now wouldn't possible, everyone
in- - [laughs] Everyone New York dog - like fleet French Bulldogs, -
Right, exactly. - taking New York City. - So, taught think dog
friend, neighbor dog, bring dog hold dog collar
make sure, gradually able stroke dog say, dog friend
distinguish wild tame animals. animals, afraid
[murmurs]. So, seemed better. called back three months later
asked her. "Well, calling?" son said. said, "Dr. Spiegel."
boy said, "That's weird." father said, "What's weird?" said, "Spiegel's
heat." bought dog, - love it. - named it, Spiegel. - love it. - Talk
transference. - love it. [David laughing]

00:37:19 Restructuring Trauma Narratives

really speaks power this. brings back issue. So,
different about, father case woman, terms
happened hypnosis allowed go completely terrified dogs
owning dog naming father? find amusing. - Yeah. -
different just two sitting talking it, right? know,
therapy, narrative huge component. - Right. - hypnosis narrative huge
component. - Right. - must that, brain state really different.
talk trauma minutes. think people trauma
phobias, certainly conversation it. might freeze up.
might lose articulation forth. different
state combines narrative, think allow underlying neural networks
engage change? 'Cause find fascinating a- Every attempt
dealing stress phobia clinical setting involves discussion
is. - Yes. - But, not talking medication introduced,
least not particular circumstances. - Right. - So, realize kind obvious
question like, difference brain activity, find incredible.
control variable brain state. not, spoken. - raising
couple important issues, Andrew. talked earlier systematic
desensitization, sort lay hierarchy things one time.
think unsystematic desensitization, changing mental states.


think evidence mental state change
therapeutic potential. seeing ketamine treating depression,
dissociogenic drug. know every morning wake up, problem,
know, made mistake reading nasty email 11:00 PM. didn't know
do. wake morning thinking, oh, idiot, yeah,
going do. So, just changing mental state, therapeutic potential. think
underestimate ability regulate change responses cognitively,
emotionally somatically flexible. so, things, right, follow similar
principles facing problem, seeing different point view. done
really, nice podcast trauma stress expose it,
not avoid it, talked before. find way reconnect it,
substitute something can make feel good, rather bad, activate
centers brain like mesolimbic reward system. so, hypnosis
can much faster. People don't think can can.
having, right now physical experience, thinking not feeling
bad used to. can powerful thing can hypnosis. So,
woman came see me, suffered attempted rape. getting dark,
coming back grocery store guy grabs wants get
apartment. outside apartment. starts fighting
winds basilar skull fracture. runs away. cops come, since hadn't
raped, left, weren't interested. wanted use hypnosis get
better image guy looked like, painful, upsetting thing. So,
quite hypnotizable. got floating. say, safe comfortable, now, nothing
can happen will harm body. left side screen, want
picture guy approaching happening. said, really,
light, getting dark. really can't see much facial features, recognize
something, hadn't allowed remember. gets upstairs, doesn't just
want rape me, going kill me. so, ways, seeing
even worse. So, thinking, good, Spiegel, made even frightened
before. pointed PTSD stress lecture, got
confront trauma, restructure understanding it. So, side
screen, picture, protect yourself? everybody
trauma situation engages strategy self protection. salience network
kicking in. said, "You know what?" surprised fighting hard.


didn't think would. so, realized one hand even worse
thought was. hand actually probably saved life.
so, way of, helping restructure experience trauma make
tolerable. helped her- didn't recog- couldn't identify guy,
helped restructure understand experience. something
can just talking, straight psychotherapy. sometimes can hell
lot faster efficiently using hypnosis. one randomized trial
Israel shows adding hypnosis PTSD treatment, actually improves
outcome. way accomplishing things understand broader
psychotherapy world, much quickly sometimes effectively. - Yeah,
sounds like going somewhat state one trying deal with,
dissociating state key. imagine, open
various podcasts. done lot analysis years. experienced
sessions, depending show them, might just get kind
laundry list happened opposed actually feeling anything, around
happened. - Right. - think people probably vary extent can
drop feeling states can depend day. can depend well
slept night on. - one thing might add, Andrew, - Yes. -
is, notion late Gordon Bower, just memorial Gordon
Stanford. died year ago. Brilliant cognitive psychologist, one founders
cognitive psychology Stanford great pitcher. almost became Major
League pitcher decided go grad school instead, glad did.
Gordon helped establish concept state dependent memory
certain mental state, enhance ability remember things it. sort
bad example drunk hides bottle can't remember
put gets drunk mental state. People go
dissociative states traumatized. way, hypnosis helping
remember deal memories better mental state
like happened. rape victims will tell you, floating
body, feeling sorry woman assaulted below. People traumatic
episodes, just say, know, blank out, don't know happening,
autopilot kind self hypnotic state. So, use hypnosis help
deal traumatic memory, making state in, right office
you, congruent state likely in, trauma happened.


think part helps facilitate treatment trauma related disorders. -
see.

00:45:14 Ketamine Therapy

makes ask, every question ask, 'cause really feel
almost like compulsion, dissociation traumatic episode is, part
adaptive strategy. - Right. - creates certain issues, creates problems, right?
something like ketamine, creates dissociative state, useful
treatment trauma? confused days colleague,
Karl Deisseroth, also podcast coworkers figured out,
okay, layer one networks neocortex, involved
dissociative state. starting gain understanding ketamine
works neural level. - Right. - seem, certain populations can
useful treatment. don't know, never tried it. don't know current status
is, legal. allowed least in, FDA approved use.
dissociative states useful element dissociation gave rise
trauma memory first place? - Well, yeah, Karl brilliant paper
nature he, rats humans one paper. showed
rhythmic discharge retrosplenial region, triggered ketamine.
rats actually showed dissociative like behavior, hot pad
ordinarily wouldn't didn't seem much pain paw.
male subject implanted electrodes- - Human, yeah. - human subject, yeah.
electrodes picked rhythmic activity. did,
report dissociative state. description was, like pilot
airplane. felt walking cockpit plane still flying
and- - sounds terrifying me. [David laughing] sounds terrify terrifying. -
thing- - want body, [David laughing] time, know. -
right but, point is, way principal, Andrew, like, principle said,
need re-confront traumatic situation can modulate associations
it. So, accept it, accept arousal, put boundaries around
figure can approach problem approach
problem different point view. So, not surprise- fact, studied,
people disassociated Loma Prieta earthquake Oakland-Berkeley


firestorm. - remember well. - Yeah. - Earthquakes follow me. move
south Northridge quake- - going keep away So, there'll one
later, afternoon. [David laughing] - starting dissociating. So, dissociation
compartmentalize experience, means point view treating trauma,
inhibition. don't engage it. like happened there. think
happens people, sometimes good able separate
recollection. somewhere. sight not mind.
effects you, can't deal it. can't reprocess it. think
one reason ketamine might work fact, allows keep, re-approach
dissociative experience way can start think something
it. just fact can turn off. also self-hypnosis
helpful. not something just comes happens you.
something can make happen. can control it, can something it. So,
feel less helpless control. essence trauma helplessness. not
fear, not pain. helplessness. become object. become just body.
don't control going on. not used that. discussed
breathing paper anticipation breathing. not whether breathe, inhale
exhale hold breath, think can inhale can't,
really upsetting, understandably. so, issue control hypnosis,
terrible reputation taking away control actually superb way enhancing
control mind body. - love reminds naming important.
almost wonder self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis called something
else, would've separated stage hypnosis way make
less scary, weird, complicated people embrace. But, - Yeah. - part reason
discussion is, great experiences hypnosis, seen
data, talking lot clinical examples. incredibly powerful boils
right neural brain states. - Right. - And,

00:50:07 Self-directed Hypnosis, Reveri

think years come, going become widespread along lines.
quickly, described examples people getting relief quickly. -
Right. - permanent, changes? need follow related
that, sure number people listening thinking, wonderful, love


get hypnotized number different things Dr. Spiegel somebody else expert
clinical hypnosis, might not access somebody similar
training. power? So, quickly work? long lasting
changes? then, necessary work clinical hypnotist? better
self-hypnosis forth? Maybe just give us contour
landscape directed self-directed treatment. - Well, typically, people
start coming see clinician like me. better see someone licensing
training professional discipline, medicine, psychology, dentistry, whatever. -
'Cause lot hypnotists there, just hypnotist. - Right. Just
hypnotists. - Oh, okay. - key issue is, somebody can really assess
problem make sure not, talking someone reducing chest
pain, rather getting coronary artery problem- - 'Cause real
issue there. - could, right. - hypnosis might adjust wouldn't deal
deeper underlying issue. - right. hand. typically use
people, often see twice periodically, not every week.
certainly not every day, pain problem hypnosis helpful pain.
so, is, identifying hypnotizable are. give standard
brief test ability experience hypnosis, going self-hypnosis
exercise deal problem, seeing respond it,
teaching themselves. old days, used use
iPhone record part session. play back hypnosis
experience. Now developed app, "Reveri," can teach people step
through, dealing pain, stress, focus, insomnia help people eat better
stop smoking. elements take 15 minutes elements just
take one two minutes people can refresh reinforce. - Two minute hypnosis,
[indistinct] one minute. - Yes. - Yeah. - one two, one two minutes
now, finding two thirds people find even just one minute
refresher, helps feel better. reporting, feel better. So, nice thing is,
know right away, whether likely help not. found, done
studies, looking hypnosis pain relief acute medical procedures.
randomized trial published Lancet, three conditions, people getting
arterial cutdowns chemoembolized tumors liver visualize renal artery
stenosis. don't use general anesthesia this. uncomfortable people
anxious three conditions. One standard care, push


button get opioids, IV. - surgery? - surgery. second
is, that, plus friendly nurse, comforting them. So, controlled
pleasant attention support. third was, taught self-hypnosis
pain control. So, feeling, can change temperature, body
cool, tingling, numb, floating ice water feeling comfortable. go
somewhere else, leave body go desert island enjoy yourself.
found that, two half hour procedure, hour half,
hypnosis group reduced pain 80%, compared standard, - Wow. care
group, using half amount opioids, fewer complications procedure
took 17 minutes less time average get done. not patient
relaxed. treatment staff. weren't dealing someone
struggling uncomfortable. measured anxiety thing.
hypnosis group, worried dead. no anxiety hour
half, saying, fine, know, fine. standard care
group, 5 10 anxiety scores point. So, published Lancet,
big randomized trial. drug that, every hospital country
using now, no industry push it. So, part helped us decide
needed help people, Reveri teach
provide interactive support it. it, question, although is,
work long term? 'Cause can acutely doesn't necessarily carry on. So,
around randomized trial women metastatic breast cancer.

low amounts medication. So, lasts. say, felt pain
chest thought metastasis, just exercise. got warm bath
felt fine. So, works becomes skill people acquire, can
tell right away, whether likely help them, working clinician now using
app ways helping learn use skill. So, nice thing will
know quickly, whether likely help not. is, can learn
yourself. - great will, again, there'll link Reveri caption,
available Apple Android. think even though nominal cost there,
think that, mentioned, medications approaches dealing
problems quite expensive, potential side effects things. Not


aren't also useful. - I, get that, - Please. - just one
thing. worked hard app. iOS app Apple. decided
table moment, redoing Android app. So, available,
working Alexa platform. not moment will soon. So, just
don't want people disappointed looking Android,
agenda don't moment.

00:56:53 Eliminating Obsessive Thoughts, Superstitions

- Great, thanks clarification. hopefully, time both, get asked lot
obsessive thoughts intrusive thoughts. also get asked lot OCD.
evidence hypnosis self-hypnosis can used for, dealing obsessive
thoughts? - Sometimes, obsessional people, just turn not
hypnotizable for, yeah, not random. tend controlling
thought, busy evaluating rather experiencing, so- - know people
like that. [David laughing] sounds like adaptive mindset lot professions. -
right. - get trained that, - Yeah. - school, obsess
exam, obsess the, - Yeah. - social interactions. mean, part
becoming functional human being. yet, can take us different- -
sometimes overdo it. mean, tell one example extreme situations, that,
know, judging, evaluating, not letting experience, including
emotionally. know somebody, listens tapes airplanes go down. So,
get black box listen it. said me, know- -
profession recreational- - No, profession. - Okay. -
did. 'Cause trying accident prevention handle things.
said worry people panicking, right? guys know
got 30 seconds 45 seconds just going
checklist. said, don't panic enough. taught do.
reason, good reason it. sometimes overdo it. painful
listen 'cause know going happen. So, kind balance
hit. sometimes get emotional absorbed not
enough sort see possibilities. can problem.
hand, sometimes rigid controlled don't let emotions guide
need protect protect others. So, say


general people OCD are, less hypnotizable side spectrum,
less likely allow engage any, typical example checking
OCD example, don't remember, whether locked door turned off
gas oven keep going back keep checking. So,
evaluative component brain, kind overrides experiential one sometimes
people can get benefit, not group select
likely respond self hypnotic approaches. - superstitions similar? -
Superstitions, think more, people hypnotizable, keep
getting caught things like superstitions there, imagination supplants
reality. seen lot happening recently. think there,
possible helped learning sort see put context, see
different point view. - developed pretty vicious superstition,
college hard break, actually. always feel, talk clinicians,
reveal certain things pathology. - Please do. - so- - get
bill later. - Thank you, yes, part reason arranged this. [David laughing] No,
just kidding. yeah, did. habit knocking wood things noticed
started to, sneak knocking wood every 'cause didn't want
people think often. started realize that, becoming
little bit reflex. saw incredible video Bence Olveczky's lab
Harvard. studies motor patterns. rats press different
sequences levers turn dials order get pellet food. that,
start introduce behaviors nothing actual lever
pressing, like start scratching hind quarters things like that. hat,
heads, excuse me, don't wear hats flipping ears. just like
pitcher throwing baseball. this, - Oh, yeah. - start incorporate
motor behaviors unrelated outcome, mind somehow starts think
necessary outcome. incorporate it. So, decided
break simply forcing not week. - Mm-hm. just
seemed like ridiculous, - [Both] thing do. Yeah, well- - Knock wood. - call
response prevention works. is, set new context
brain, get outcome want, devoid extraneous behavior. - Yeah,
knew nuts, right. knew illogical. - Right.

01:01:50 ‘Hypnotizability’, Spiegel Eye-roll Test



- somehow things take meaning. - [David] Right. - So, talked about,
utility hypnosis stress reduction, phobias, pain, possibly, don't know for,
things like ADHD OCD, just will depend hypnotizability. - Right. - talked
beautiful study the, metastatic breast cancer outcome patients.
Hypnotizability clearly key variable. - Yes. - please tell us,
hypnotizability is, evaluated Spiegel Eye-Roll Test is? - Okay,
sure. So, hypnotizability just capacity hypnotic experiences.
test called hypnotic conduction profile. give highly structured hypnotic
experience. old tradition clinical hypnosis was, try bunch
different things, talking, walking upstairs downstairs images time
say breathing subject that. change
clinician, less can make variation outcome. take
long time, know, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. just view kind complex,
not effective way assessing person's hypnotic capacity. know
peak period hypnotizability human life, latency years childhood. So,
every eight year old trance time. call 'em dinner, don't
hear ya, thing. childhood wonderful
experience. Work play thing. try make little
adults, think terrible mistake. Everything fun them. enjoy learning,
enjoy everything. - age this- - like 6 10, 6 11.
playful, enjoy everything. Everything sort game fun try
make miserable them, got it. when, Piaget called,
adult cognitive framework, learn abstract concepts, learn even one
bottle looks bigger other, can equal volume. so, imposing
logic, growing DLPFC point imposing cognitive structure
experience. people start lose hypnotic ability. time
early 20s, hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed. study done
Stanford, Ernest Hillard, Phil Zimbardo this, looking at, tracked
students psych one, hypnotizability measured retested
blindly 25 years later. test, retest correlation was, want guess
was? - guessing it's, don't know, 0.6 something. - Yeah, close. 0.7, IQ
0.6, 25 year interval. - Wow. - So, stable IQ 25
year interval. So, point, are. factors


lead that? Well, means that, third adults just
not hypnotizable. Two thirds are, 15% extremely hypnotizable can
measure give number 0 10. useful.
patients it, say, look, sorry, not hypnotizable going
something else. Medication, systematic desensitization, mindfulness, things
hypnotizable, just go it. don't lot explaining. People
low moderate hypnotizable, like explanations doing,
can still get benefits. So, helps guide nature treatment
people. Now, eye roll is, father used use eye fixation induction, used
say, look ceiling now close eyes looking up. very,
yes, very- - Yeah [indistinct] [laughs]. - noticed two patients back
back. one woman seen work with, hysterical seizures.
just suddenly start shaking. And- - Real epileptic seizures? - No, pseudo
epileptic seizures. - see, hysteria. - Hysteria, although people both,
the, people, real epilepsy becomes framework gets elaborated on,
stressed, seizures. just pseudo epilepsy, no EEG
abnormalities. really something watch. husband move
work bench near door, started seizure, run home
try help it. bad. noticed
did, looked up, one seizure events, see
sclera, don't see Iris anymore. start seize. great thing
her. taught seizures. Everybody else telling stop.
made one. hypnotized her, [indistinct] go back last time
one sure enough, start shake. gradually make smaller
smaller. So, learning control, access, like
PTSD, confront, don't avoid it, don't suppress it. confront figure
deal it. next patient rigid obsessional businessman
wanted stop controlling [chuckles], reminded me,
New Yorker cartoon driver, comes yield sign yells, "Never!"
always [indistinct]. - sounds right, New Yorker. - Yeah, New
Yorker. so, guy, tried look up, couldn't keep eyes
closed them. so, father started testing people. seemed
rough correlation capacity keep eyes up, closed
measured hypnotizability. - people listening [stutters], watching


video. So, Spiegel Eye-Roll Test, involves looking ceiling. So, tilting
head back, tilting chin back looking ceiling now. also
directing eyes upward eyes open. eye roll test involves
then, closing eyelids eyes open. - open. - whether not,
eyes roll back said it, see sclera, white part. - see sclera,
white part. - means you're, hypnotizable moderately hypnotizable. -
Right. - Whereas eyes move see iris, colored part eye
eyes close, less hypnotizable. - Right. - can look online there, just
put Spiegel Eye-Roll Test find it. also going actual
example hypnosis video later. - Right. So, asking brain something
difficult, keep eyes closing eyelids. contradictory signals
third, fourth sixth cranial nerve nuclei control eye movement. - said
third- - Fourth six, - Yup. - cranial nerve nuclei. suspending one
activity, asking another eye movements lot levels
consciousness. periaqueductal gray, surrounds cranial nerve nuclei.
close eyes sleep, rapid eye movement dream.
drugs, affect level consciousness, can affect eyes eye movements,
either dilation contraction pupils, depending whether stimulant
opioid. - Stimulants, make pupils big. - Big, right? - Yeah. Like cocaine,
amphetamine. - Right, exactly. - Things sort. - opioids, get constricted
pupils. - parents looking kids coming door late night,
looking substance abuse. - right. - Yeah. - So, something
eyes lot level consciousness. mean, obviously, close
eyes go sleep, rapid eye movement dreaming.
So, not surprising. old Zen practice called, looking third eye.
think part reason happens is, looking inside like
third eye two forehead. think
visual creatures, pretty pathetic physical point view. Many animals
can outrun us, outs smell us eagles read newsprint hundred yards
can't. So, major defensive sensory input vision. animals,
predator animals eyes front head, good,
detailed vision prey. Whereas prey animals like deer, eyes side
head. So, don't see things well, much bigger range potential
see threat. mainly use, fact, interesting, social


anthropologists say, gather do, coastlines edge
forest something, got protection back. Something can
attack one side big vision might threaten you.
tend attracted kinds physical situations, so- - Yeah, love vistas. -
love vistas, right. - Vistas calming. take us panoramic
vision. - right. - didn't know this, turns scenic spots
location national parks people naturally aggregated was-
makes sense. - Sure. - But, signs locations built around, people's
tendency animals tendencies. - Oh, really [indistinct]? - aggregate there. Yeah,
interesting book history national parks says, didn't
give research study support it, no Google Maps, obviously. -
interesting. - Yeah, panorama visual boundaries really interesting. think,
eyes, know, two pieces central nervous system brain,
outside the- - Right. used say eyes outside skull neuro-
ophthalmologist wrote vehemently pointed outside
cranial vault, so, know. outside cranial vault two pieces
brain there. so, mentioned cranial nerves, three, four six.
isn't neuroanatomy course maybe go little deeper there. So, said
contradictory activity, looking controlled one set cranial nerves.
closing eyelids, controlled another cranial nerve. - No,
one. think six close eyes, activate, no, facial,
guess facial nerve. 7, yeah. - 7, yeah. - looking up, activating
muscles force eyes look up. closing eyelids normally relaxes
those, relaxes upper movement, eyes closed don't
need it. breaking usual customary pattern. - like rubbing the, -
Right. - hey, can't even it, see like the, - Right. [Andrew David laughing] -
exactly right. - Rubbing tummy patting head. bit
conflict there, - Right. - clinically, good probe you, - has. -
father. So, Spiegel senior Spiegel junior? - Spiegel senior. -
developed Spiegel Eye-Roll Test. - key issue this, normally
close eyes also, going sleep. not worried going
world anymore. Here, maintaining resting alertness. So, focusing
turning inward. unusual state. Normally close eyes periodically,
to, close eyes period time, normally go


sleep not worried detecting risk threat. So, interesting state
turning inward, basically, looking up, shutting eyes
allowing whatever happens outside happen focusing
going inward. So, think signal brain turn inward. - interesting.
meditation course, done eyes open almost always done
eyes closed. - Yes, right. - interesting. So, can quickly determine
whether not someone highly hypnotizable. - Right. - not hypnotizable.
said two thirds people can hypnotized. - Right. - Obviously third cannot.
within two thirds can, range, said 15% people fall
this, highly hypnotizable category. - Right, correct. - seem member
of. - Yeah. - And, repeated use self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis, increase
change hypnotizability, can access first place? - say
general, may increase little bit, not hell lot, not worth effort
increase hypnotizability point. worth trying deal problem,
dealing with. So, can get better using level have.
study done tried train people hypnotizable
obviously, there're subjective behavioral components test, can learn
little better them. found reanalyze data,
account three times final score, based initial hypnotizability
measurement, rather whether not trained better. So,
can improve little

01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)

not worth trouble. - Got it. Along lines eyes eye movements, lot
interest EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. -
Shapiro working, wasn't Stanford directly, local
Stanford. - Yeah. - think Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - thoughts
EMDR? useful, think less useful? things
EMDR combined make useful? listeners podcast
come to, think, come podcast range backgrounds interests. me,
makes sense EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given newer
data can suppress amygdala activity animals animal models
humans well. really hasn't explored much, neurally. heard things like,


coordinates two sides brain, it, just throwaway. don't think
evidence that, coordinating two sides brain better not
coordinating. wouldn't speaking right now two sides brain, well
correlated. - Yeah. - language lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - heard
mimics, rapid eye movements sleep, actually doesn't. So, - Right. -
heard people talk positive experiences EMDR.
thoughts EMDR? - Yeah, good comment one recent
podcasts. tell you, one way sort think bemused point view,
old, mentioned earlier, oldest sort idea hypnotic induction,
dangling watch, right? [indistinct] watch. And, fact, enough concern
automobiles invented, movement prevent
installing windshield wipers people afraid hypnotized,
watched windshield wipers go back forth car. Now, turns
fortunately that, tend not look windshield wipers. keep looking
windshield. so, windshield wipers today. movement is,
exactly used hypnotic induction. think lot hypnosis EMDR. - Ah. -
think, combination exposure based treatments, use
EMDR think it. tend not process experience much just
physical part it, personally think drawback. And, every study seen
dismantling study. no question people go EMDR, many
get better trauma related problems VA big program using
on. every program dismantled, going treatment
lateral eye movement, shown lateral eye movement, doesn't add
anything it. toward end career, Francine [indistinct]

things. So, tend think that, EMDR another form exposure based therapy
trauma, implied exception possible new data, certainly
doesn't with, rapid eye movement sleep. don't think moving eyes
issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put
weight this, going re-injure ankle example, simply mean
body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat
something coming opportunity something ameliorate situation. So,
not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding
happening. face also say, opportunity
something it. minute realistically enha- doesn't mean,
imagine away heart attack. means figure rehabilitate heart attack


broken leg something like way get much control

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body
floating, safe comfortable. Now, picture Mary sit feeling sadness
no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing

we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described

important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring

Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,

absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go

thinking it, way pain control hypnosis can

want see happen body. So, like right margin,
can enhance, me, like way augmenting hypnosis,
medication, think powerful way that. - Great, really excited see

change vision don't, know, typically physically relaxed
state, frankly people peak performance, including physical athletic
performance musical performance hypnotic states too. talked
classical pianists say, not thinking, start thinking fingers
now, screw up. floating piano, thinking tone want
feel exuding instrument. hypnotic like state too. many athletes
peak performance, just flowing it. not thinking step step,
doing? best working
giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much

looking telephoto lens camera consciousness, see, see
great detail, devoid context. experience getting caught
good movie, forget watching movie enter imaginary
world. part movie, not part audience, experiencing it,
not evaluating it. hypnotic like experience many people
everyday lives. - So, experience really draws us in, hypnotic sense?
let give different example. watching sports game really wrapped
game, also touch makes feel body kind
registering excitement anticipation. state hypnosis also,
mentioned kind of, narrowing context. - Right. - kind losing
self, it, right? - Yes, true you're- [indistinct] extent

00:16:45 Stage Hypnosis

want understand better. want see can do. Stage hypnotists
drive nuts. make fools people. one. case father
involved. got call from, Columbia, got call, Spiegel, got
come see woman, ER. kind weird upset state
happened. turned show stage hypnotist who,
way is, cycle around, know, beginning show,
don't just grab somebody say, this. get bunch people up.
[indistinct] testing, see people- get ones
hypnotizable. one. said, now little bird

just gets off stage, 'cause upsetting. wandering around New
York City middle night dissociated brought Columbia.
father saw her. still kind uncomfortable trance like state.
turned out, trophy wife wealthy guy. felt like bird
gilded cage. her, image just triggered sense of, dissatisfaction
discomfort, fear life. able get reoriented talk
going life. don't like stage hypnosis.
making fools people using fact, scares people
hypnosis. think losing control. gaining control. Self-hypnosis
way enhancing control, mind body. can work well,
gives kind cognitive flexibility, able shift sets easily.
give judging evaluating way usually see something
different point view. great therapeutic opportunity, misused,
danger too, scares people it. ability suspend
critical judgment just experience see happens. can
great therapeutic opportunity, somebody's misusing it, can way harm
people. plenty examples people, fantasies imposed them,
come think realities. not unusual days. So, ability that,
people learn recognize understand it, can tremendous therapeutic tool. -
stage hypnotized clinically hypnotized many times self-


hypnosis app. talk later. know plans hypnotize
today. done before. - Mm-hm. - [Andrew] hypnotizable
know. - Right. - talk about, one can gauge hypnotizability. - Sure.
- stage hypnosis, interesting. college, brought someone
dormitory and, recall one people selected. - Mm-hm. -
engaging bizarre behavior, right? wasn't thoroughly embarrassing,
pretty embarrassing. sent off stage, exiting, suddenly
screaming something planted suggestion sort. - Ah, mm-
hm. - told look pocket was, like a, think, torn
dollar bill. bunch things vague recollection of.

00:20:25 Neurobiology Hypnosis

- Mm-hm. raises set questions really boil to, biologist, always
think that, no events brain, processes. hypnosis, know
induction. one hypnotized, imagine. sounds like woman
example bird distraught New York City, failure exit
hypnotic state. know sorts brain areas active induction,
call deep hypnosis shutting off changing people exit
hypnosis. - Yes, do, studied that. interested that. so,
study selected highly non-hypnotizable people
comparison. hypnotize functional MRI scanner. found
three things characterized entry hypnotic state. first turning
activity dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. DACC central front-middle
part brain well know. part call salience network.
conflict detector. engaged work hear loud noise think
might gunshot, anterior cingulate cortex saying, hey, wait minute,
potential danger there. better pay attention it. So, compares
else going helps decide do.
can imagine, turning activity region, make less likely
distracted pulled whatever in. another study, found
highly hypnotizable people, even without hypnotized, functional
connectivity DACC, anterior cingulate cortex left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex. So, part key region executive control network. So,


engaging tasks, enacting plan, writing paper,
whatever doing. prefrontal cortex that. so,
coordinated, found functional connectivity. So, one up, other's
one down, other's down. coordination implies brain saying,
okay, go ahead, know doing. Carry plan. don't worry
possibilities. So, two things happen people hypnotized. One
DLPFC higher functional connectivity insula. Another part
salience network. part mind-body control system, sensitive
happening body. part pain network well, also region
brain where, can control things body wouldn't think could.
example, study years ago, took people highly
hypnotizable, hypnotized told them, went imaginary culinary tour. So,
eat favorite foods found that, increased gastric acid
secretion, like 87%. So, stomach acting though get,
mean, one woman, vivid halfway through, said,
stop, full, [laughs] eating imaginary- - never eaten- - never
eaten anything- - Actual food? - No. - Incredible. - got relax
think anything food drink. got like 40% decrease gastric acid
secretions. DLPFC insula, telling stomach getting
food not getting food. even, injected Pentagastrin,
triggers gastric acid release. even hypnosis condition, 19%
reduction gastric acid. So, brain amazing ability control going
body ways don't think ability control. just one
example. So, DLPFC insula connection. third thing happens,
relates stage, inverse functional connectivity
DLPFC posterior cingulate cortex. posterior cingulate part
default mode network. back brain. area whose activity goes
example, meditators. meditation, supposed selfless.
supposed to, [indistinct] self illusion, supposed let dissolve
just experience things. that, posterior cingulate decreasing
activity, inverse connection is, something not thinking
means me. may not even remember much it. do, don't care much
it. so, part dissociation occur hypnosis. So,
put things outside conscious awareness, don't worry means.


also adds cognitive flexibility. thinking, well, people like don't usually
this. may inhibit from, enacting new form psychotherapy example,
never done before. decreased activity part
brain reflects means, likely cognitively flexible
willing give try. one therapeutic advantages hypnosis well. -
Fascinating, really, going embarrass little bit. [David laughing]
positive sense, laboratory really one pioneered brain imaging
hypnotic states. And, sounds like it, understanding, correct? - Yeah,
mean, people, who've done excellent research too. - Sure. Pierre
Rainville Montreal several people,

00:26:04 ADHD

one leading labs neuroimaging hypnosis. - ask about,
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. get lot questions this. think lot
people just struggle holding attention nowadays, interference
phones devices. course, lot of, clinically legitimate ADHD there,
way describe, - Sure. - dorsal anterior cingulate salience
network conflict detector of, focusing something splitting
attention? distractable I? Seems relate extent activity
anterior cingulate cortex. people ADHD, display disruptions elements
networks hypnosis ever used to, self-hypnosis, be,
distinguish stage hypnosis, clinical self-hypnosis used enhance
people's ability focus hold attention? built component
hypnotic state. - great question. sort two ways think it,
terms enhancing focus, yes. helpful teaching people just prepare
mind narrow focus something. really engaged
reading something, writing pa- mean, that, sometimes thinking,
oh God, another hour. times hour will go think,
hey, great, that, feels game-like you, just assembling
parts puzzle putting 'em together. fun, just get absorbed,
me, hypnotic like experience, trouble, struggling,
sometimes things like self-hypnosis can help. not expert ADHD.
impression right, people constantly distracted


rather rigid. part easily distractable. upset
get distracted rather rigid want attend
can. think, way controlling this, distractibility, frankly. guess many
people ADHD, not hypnotizable, haven't studied it. So,
possible people disorder,

00:28:22 Hypnosis Stress & Sleep

training self-hypnosis might help, see hypnotizable
take there. - want return underlying neural networks
clinical applications but, sorts things aside asthma, used
hypnosis successfully others used clinical hypnosis for?
particular areas of, psychiatric challenges illnesses, guess called,
particularly amenable hypnotic treatment. - Yes, are. Hypnosis good
problem focused treatment. oldest western conception psychotherapy,
can used specific problems way helpful. found helpful
stress reduction. helping people deal, dealing stress days.
helpful, mind-body connection helpful part problem
stress perception. mentioned earlier sort good sense,
football game something, feel physical reaction. can reinforcing
thing. Wow, exciting, it. can also distracting. So, worried
getting COVID worried about, physical problem have.
notice body, body tenses up, start sweat. sympathetic
nervous system goes, heart rate goes up. notice think, oh
God, really bad. feel worse. So, like snowball rolling downhill.
feel worse body gets worse. Hypnosis can helpful
dissociating somatic reaction psychological reactions. So, teach people
imagine body floating somewhere safe comfortable like bath, lake, hot tub
floating space, picture problem stressing imaginary
screen, rule, no matter see screen, keep body
comfortable. So, point, still can't control stress, can control
physical reaction it. starts feeling control. least one
thing can manage. can use think visualize one
thing might stressor. So, hypnosis helpful controlling mind-


body interaction relation stress. helpful people get sleep.
lot fun that. getting emails people said, haven't slept right
15 years, now first time, listening app can sleep night.
helpful again, wake middle night, tell people, don't
look clock. arousal cue. wake more, picture whatever
thinking worrying imaginary screen body
floating. So, watch movie, keep body floating. many people can
use get back sleep. - using self-hypnosis sleep long time.
now Reveri app, talk relationship Reveri app
uses. find incredibly useful falling back asleep middle night.
raises question, found think understand correctly, one can self-
hypnosis daytime. issue comes later, like,
instance, self-hypnosis stress reduction, away stressful event prepare
one deal stress better. - Right. - hypnosis improving return sleep.
can done actually want go sleep. kind training
networks,

00:32:12 Hypnosis Strengthen Neural Connections

right? - right. - So, evidence that, brain networks actually form
stronger connections, people self-hypnosis time? - Well, rule
neurobiology know, neurons fire together wire together. - friend,
Carla Shatz. - Yes, Carla- - Not Donald Hebb, way. [David laughing] keep trying
to, widespread myth world unfortunately, internet,
that, fire together wire together said by, psychologist, Donald Hebb
Donald Hebb many important things, neurobiologist Carla Shatz- -
exactly right. - Who, Yes, Stanford also Berkeley Harvard. So, also
decent schools. - exactly right. - Stanford, said, fire together wire
together. deserves, - Right. - credit statement. Yeah,
repeated use self-hypnosis, one imagine networks getting
stronger. - think so. don't evidence yet, long term
potentiation provides pathway described program, number
times allow repeated activation network actually build new connections
work. least, even learning memory point view, memory


network associations. remember things. example like
give is, go back grade school see little tiny lockers
size wrong. suddenly flood memories obviously stored
there, just didn't think of. So, context association memory's about.
start acquire memories problem. So, one thing use hypnosis
treating phobias, example. problem people phobias, like
airplane phobias crossing bridge high, avoid
more, source associations memories fear. don't
good experiences 'cause avoid it. like get back horse fall
off kind thing. hypnosis, can start people able manage anxiety
enough can more, wider array experiences, start
network associations isn't negative may even positive. - almost
like a, sorry interrupt, ask. - Sure - almost like a, exposure therapy
done mind. - Yes. - always mind. mean, even exposure to,
snake phobia, don't, don't like snakes, don't think qualifies full
blown phobia. think healthy fear snakes. - Yeah. - if, say
snake phobia, typical approach in, be, cognitive behavioral approaches, right,
show picture snake, rubber snake, real snake.
Eventually person is, - Yeah. - holding boa constrictor something like that. -
[David] Right. - mind translate nervous system
signals. hypnosis, sounds like can give number positive experiences
without use props, without bring animals room. - Right,
I- - Drive someone across bridge, right? - Yes, woman,
successful business woman, high level corporation. terrible dog phobia.
imagine somebody brought dog room said, "what
doing?" see getting tense. said, "Well, waiting
see dog does." said, "If somebody works you, comes
office, freeze wait see did?" said, "Of course not,
tell 'em do." [laughs] said, "Well, immobilizing yourself, power
isn't dog you, so, imagine might engage dog
help control situation." said, "Thanks." reminds of, one
favorite stories hypnosis that, father seeing woman lived
Midtown Manhattan horrible dog phobia. dropped things, spill
coffee saw dog. time trips store, thought


least likely people walking dogs. - Now wouldn't possible, everyone
in- - [laughs] Everyone New York dog - like fleet French Bulldogs, -
Right, exactly. - taking New York City. - So, taught think dog
friend, neighbor dog, bring dog hold dog collar
make sure, gradually able stroke dog say, dog friend
distinguish wild tame animals. animals, afraid
[murmurs]. So, seemed better. called back three months later
asked her. "Well, calling?" son said. said, "Dr. Spiegel."
boy said, "That's weird." father said, "What's weird?" said, "Spiegel's
heat." bought dog, - love it. - named it, Spiegel. - love it. - Talk
transference. - love it. [David laughing]

00:37:19 Restructuring Trauma Narratives

really speaks power this. brings back issue. So,
different about, father case woman, terms
happened hypnosis allowed go completely terrified dogs
owning dog naming father? find amusing. - Yeah. -
different just two sitting talking it, right? know,
therapy, narrative huge component. - Right. - hypnosis narrative huge
component. - Right. - must that, brain state really different.
talk trauma minutes. think people trauma
phobias, certainly conversation it. might freeze up.
might lose articulation forth. different
state combines narrative, think allow underlying neural networks
engage change? 'Cause find fascinating a- Every attempt
dealing stress phobia clinical setting involves discussion
is. - Yes. - But, not talking medication introduced,
least not particular circumstances. - Right. - So, realize kind obvious
question like, difference brain activity, find incredible.
control variable brain state. not, spoken. - raising
couple important issues, Andrew. talked earlier systematic
desensitization, sort lay hierarchy things one time.
think unsystematic desensitization, changing mental states.


think evidence mental state change
therapeutic potential. seeing ketamine treating depression,
dissociogenic drug. know every morning wake up, problem,
know, made mistake reading nasty email 11:00 PM. didn't know
do. wake morning thinking, oh, idiot, yeah,
going do. So, just changing mental state, therapeutic potential. think
underestimate ability regulate change responses cognitively,
emotionally somatically flexible. so, things, right, follow similar
principles facing problem, seeing different point view. done
really, nice podcast trauma stress expose it,
not avoid it, talked before. find way reconnect it,
substitute something can make feel good, rather bad, activate
centers brain like mesolimbic reward system. so, hypnosis
can much faster. People don't think can can.
having, right now physical experience, thinking not feeling
bad used to. can powerful thing can hypnosis. So,
woman came see me, suffered attempted rape. getting dark,
coming back grocery store guy grabs wants get
apartment. outside apartment. starts fighting
winds basilar skull fracture. runs away. cops come, since hadn't
raped, left, weren't interested. wanted use hypnosis get
better image guy looked like, painful, upsetting thing. So,
quite hypnotizable. got floating. say, safe comfortable, now, nothing
can happen will harm body. left side screen, want
picture guy approaching happening. said, really,
light, getting dark. really can't see much facial features, recognize
something, hadn't allowed remember. gets upstairs, doesn't just
want rape me, going kill me. so, ways, seeing
even worse. So, thinking, good, Spiegel, made even frightened
before. pointed PTSD stress lecture, got
confront trauma, restructure understanding it. So, side
screen, picture, protect yourself? everybody
trauma situation engages strategy self protection. salience network
kicking in. said, "You know what?" surprised fighting hard.


didn't think would. so, realized one hand even worse
thought was. hand actually probably saved life.
so, way of, helping restructure experience trauma make
tolerable. helped her- didn't recog- couldn't identify guy,
helped restructure understand experience. something
can just talking, straight psychotherapy. sometimes can hell
lot faster efficiently using hypnosis. one randomized trial
Israel shows adding hypnosis PTSD treatment, actually improves
outcome. way accomplishing things understand broader
psychotherapy world, much quickly sometimes effectively. - Yeah,
sounds like going somewhat state one trying deal with,
dissociating state key. imagine, open
various podcasts. done lot analysis years. experienced
sessions, depending show them, might just get kind
laundry list happened opposed actually feeling anything, around
happened. - Right. - think people probably vary extent can
drop feeling states can depend day. can depend well
slept night on. - one thing might add, Andrew, - Yes. -
is, notion late Gordon Bower, just memorial Gordon
Stanford. died year ago. Brilliant cognitive psychologist, one founders
cognitive psychology Stanford great pitcher. almost became Major
League pitcher decided go grad school instead, glad did.
Gordon helped establish concept state dependent memory
certain mental state, enhance ability remember things it. sort
bad example drunk hides bottle can't remember
put gets drunk mental state. People go
dissociative states traumatized. way, hypnosis helping
remember deal memories better mental state
like happened. rape victims will tell you, floating
body, feeling sorry woman assaulted below. People traumatic
episodes, just say, know, blank out, don't know happening,
autopilot kind self hypnotic state. So, use hypnosis help
deal traumatic memory, making state in, right office
you, congruent state likely in, trauma happened.


think part helps facilitate treatment trauma related disorders. -
see.

00:45:14 Ketamine Therapy

makes ask, every question ask, 'cause really feel
almost like compulsion, dissociation traumatic episode is, part
adaptive strategy. - Right. - creates certain issues, creates problems, right?
something like ketamine, creates dissociative state, useful
treatment trauma? confused days colleague,
Karl Deisseroth, also podcast coworkers figured out,
okay, layer one networks neocortex, involved
dissociative state. starting gain understanding ketamine
works neural level. - Right. - seem, certain populations can
useful treatment. don't know, never tried it. don't know current status
is, legal. allowed least in, FDA approved use.
dissociative states useful element dissociation gave rise
trauma memory first place? - Well, yeah, Karl brilliant paper
nature he, rats humans one paper. showed
rhythmic discharge retrosplenial region, triggered ketamine.
rats actually showed dissociative like behavior, hot pad
ordinarily wouldn't didn't seem much pain paw.
male subject implanted electrodes- - Human, yeah. - human subject, yeah.
electrodes picked rhythmic activity. did,
report dissociative state. description was, like pilot
airplane. felt walking cockpit plane still flying
and- - sounds terrifying me. [David laughing] sounds terrify terrifying. -
thing- - want body, [David laughing] time, know. -
right but, point is, way principal, Andrew, like, principle said,
need re-confront traumatic situation can modulate associations
it. So, accept it, accept arousal, put boundaries around
figure can approach problem approach
problem different point view. So, not surprise- fact, studied,
people disassociated Loma Prieta earthquake Oakland-Berkeley


firestorm. - remember well. - Yeah. - Earthquakes follow me. move
south Northridge quake- - going keep away So, there'll one
later, afternoon. [David laughing] - starting dissociating. So, dissociation
compartmentalize experience, means point view treating trauma,
inhibition. don't engage it. like happened there. think
happens people, sometimes good able separate
recollection. somewhere. sight not mind.
effects you, can't deal it. can't reprocess it. think
one reason ketamine might work fact, allows keep, re-approach
dissociative experience way can start think something
it. just fact can turn off. also self-hypnosis
helpful. not something just comes happens you.
something can make happen. can control it, can something it. So,
feel less helpless control. essence trauma helplessness. not
fear, not pain. helplessness. become object. become just body.
don't control going on. not used that. discussed
breathing paper anticipation breathing. not whether breathe, inhale
exhale hold breath, think can inhale can't,
really upsetting, understandably. so, issue control hypnosis,
terrible reputation taking away control actually superb way enhancing
control mind body. - love reminds naming important.
almost wonder self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis called something
else, would've separated stage hypnosis way make
less scary, weird, complicated people embrace. But, - Yeah. - part reason
discussion is, great experiences hypnosis, seen
data, talking lot clinical examples. incredibly powerful boils
right neural brain states. - Right. - And,

00:50:07 Self-directed Hypnosis, Reveri

think years come, going become widespread along lines.
quickly, described examples people getting relief quickly. -
Right. - permanent, changes? need follow related
that, sure number people listening thinking, wonderful, love


get hypnotized number different things Dr. Spiegel somebody else expert
clinical hypnosis, might not access somebody similar
training. power? So, quickly work? long lasting
changes? then, necessary work clinical hypnotist? better
self-hypnosis forth? Maybe just give us contour
landscape directed self-directed treatment. - Well, typically, people
start coming see clinician like me. better see someone licensing
training professional discipline, medicine, psychology, dentistry, whatever. -
'Cause lot hypnotists there, just hypnotist. - Right. Just
hypnotists. - Oh, okay. - key issue is, somebody can really assess
problem make sure not, talking someone reducing chest
pain, rather getting coronary artery problem- - 'Cause real
issue there. - could, right. - hypnosis might adjust wouldn't deal
deeper underlying issue. - right. hand. typically use
people, often see twice periodically, not every week.
certainly not every day, pain problem hypnosis helpful pain.
so, is, identifying hypnotizable are. give standard
brief test ability experience hypnosis, going self-hypnosis
exercise deal problem, seeing respond it,
teaching themselves. old days, used use
iPhone record part session. play back hypnosis
experience. Now developed app, "Reveri," can teach people step
through, dealing pain, stress, focus, insomnia help people eat better
stop smoking. elements take 15 minutes elements just
take one two minutes people can refresh reinforce. - Two minute hypnosis,
[indistinct] one minute. - Yes. - Yeah. - one two, one two minutes
now, finding two thirds people find even just one minute
refresher, helps feel better. reporting, feel better. So, nice thing is,
know right away, whether likely help not. found, done
studies, looking hypnosis pain relief acute medical procedures.
randomized trial published Lancet, three conditions, people getting
arterial cutdowns chemoembolized tumors liver visualize renal artery
stenosis. don't use general anesthesia this. uncomfortable people
anxious three conditions. One standard care, push

found that, two half hour procedure, hour half,

00:56:53 Eliminating Obsessive Thoughts, Superstitions

- Great, thanks clarification. hopefully, time both, get asked lot
obsessive thoughts intrusive thoughts. also get asked lot OCD.
evidence hypnosis self-hypnosis can used for, dealing obsessive
thoughts? - Sometimes, obsessional people, just turn not
hypnotizable for, yeah, not random. tend controlling
thought, busy evaluating rather experiencing, so- - know people
like that. [David laughing] sounds like adaptive mindset lot professions. -
right. - get trained that, - Yeah. - school, obsess
exam, obsess the, - Yeah. - social interactions. mean, part
becoming functional human being. yet, can take us different- -
sometimes overdo it. mean, tell one example extreme situations, that,
know, judging, evaluating, not letting experience, including
emotionally. know somebody, listens tapes airplanes go down. So,
get black box listen it. said me, know- -
profession recreational- - No, profession. - Okay. -
did. 'Cause trying accident prevention handle things.
said worry people panicking, right? guys know
got 30 seconds 45 seconds just going
checklist. said, don't panic enough. taught do.
reason, good reason it. sometimes overdo it. painful
listen 'cause know going happen. So, kind balance
hit. sometimes get emotional absorbed not
enough sort see possibilities. can problem.
hand, sometimes rigid controlled don't let emotions guide
need protect protect others. So, say


general people OCD are, less hypnotizable side spectrum,
less likely allow engage any, typical example checking
OCD example, don't remember, whether locked door turned off
gas oven keep going back keep checking. So,
evaluative component brain, kind overrides experiential one sometimes
people can get benefit, not group select
likely respond self hypnotic approaches. - superstitions similar? -
Superstitions, think more, people hypnotizable, keep
getting caught things like superstitions there, imagination supplants
reality. seen lot happening recently. think there,
possible helped learning sort see put context, see
different point view. - developed pretty vicious superstition,
college hard break, actually. always feel, talk clinicians,
reveal certain things pathology. - Please do. - so- - get
bill later. - Thank you, yes, part reason arranged this. [David laughing] No,
just kidding. yeah, did. habit knocking wood things noticed
started to, sneak knocking wood every 'cause didn't want
people think often. started realize that, becoming
little bit reflex. saw incredible video Bence Olveczky's lab
Harvard. studies motor patterns. rats press different
sequences levers turn dials order get pellet food. that,
start introduce behaviors nothing actual lever
pressing, like start scratching hind quarters things like that. hat,
heads, excuse me, don't wear hats flipping ears. just like
pitcher throwing baseball. this, - Oh, yeah. - start incorporate
motor behaviors unrelated outcome, mind somehow starts think
necessary outcome. incorporate it. So, decided
break simply forcing not week. - Mm-hm. just
seemed like ridiculous, - [Both] thing do. Yeah, well- - Knock wood. - call
response prevention works. is, set new context
brain, get outcome want, devoid extraneous behavior. - Yeah,
knew nuts, right. knew illogical. - Right.

01:01:50 ‘Hypnotizability’, Spiegel Eye-roll Test



- somehow things take meaning. - [David] Right. - So, talked about,
utility hypnosis stress reduction, phobias, pain, possibly, don't know for,
things like ADHD OCD, just will depend hypnotizability. - Right. - talked
beautiful study the, metastatic breast cancer outcome patients.
Hypnotizability clearly key variable. - Yes. - please tell us,
hypnotizability is, evaluated Spiegel Eye-Roll Test is? - Okay,
sure. So, hypnotizability just capacity hypnotic experiences.
test called hypnotic conduction profile. give highly structured hypnotic
experience. old tradition clinical hypnosis was, try bunch
different things, talking, walking upstairs downstairs images time
say breathing subject that. change
clinician, less can make variation outcome. take
long time, know, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. just view kind complex,
not effective way assessing person's hypnotic capacity. know
peak period hypnotizability human life, latency years childhood. So,
every eight year old trance time. call 'em dinner, don't
hear ya, thing. childhood wonderful
experience. Work play thing. try make little
adults, think terrible mistake. Everything fun them. enjoy learning,
enjoy everything. - age this- - like 6 10, 6 11.
playful, enjoy everything. Everything sort game fun try
make miserable them, got it. when, Piaget called,
adult cognitive framework, learn abstract concepts, learn even one
bottle looks bigger other, can equal volume. so, imposing
logic, growing DLPFC point imposing cognitive structure
experience. people start lose hypnotic ability. time
early 20s, hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed. study done
Stanford, Ernest Hillard, Phil Zimbardo this, looking at, tracked
students psych one, hypnotizability measured retested
blindly 25 years later. test, retest correlation was, want guess
was? - guessing it's, don't know, 0.6 something. - Yeah, close. 0.7, IQ
0.6, 25 year interval. - Wow. - So, stable IQ 25
year interval. So, point, are. factors


lead that? Well, means that, third adults just
not hypnotizable. Two thirds are, 15% extremely hypnotizable can
measure give number 0 10. useful.
patients it, say, look, sorry, not hypnotizable going
something else. Medication, systematic desensitization, mindfulness, things
hypnotizable, just go it. don't lot explaining. People
low moderate hypnotizable, like explanations doing,
can still get benefits. So, helps guide nature treatment
people. Now, eye roll is, father used use eye fixation induction, used
say, look ceiling now close eyes looking up. very,
yes, very- - Yeah [indistinct] [laughs]. - noticed two patients back
back. one woman seen work with, hysterical seizures.
just suddenly start shaking. And- - Real epileptic seizures? - No, pseudo
epileptic seizures. - see, hysteria. - Hysteria, although people both,
the, people, real epilepsy becomes framework gets elaborated on,
stressed, seizures. just pseudo epilepsy, no EEG
abnormalities. really something watch. husband move
work bench near door, started seizure, run home
try help it. bad. noticed
did, looked up, one seizure events, see
sclera, don't see Iris anymore. start seize. great thing
her. taught seizures. Everybody else telling stop.
made one. hypnotized her, [indistinct] go back last time
one sure enough, start shake. gradually make smaller
smaller. So, learning control, access, like
PTSD, confront, don't avoid it, don't suppress it. confront figure
deal it. next patient rigid obsessional businessman
wanted stop controlling [chuckles], reminded me,
New Yorker cartoon driver, comes yield sign yells, "Never!"
always [indistinct]. - sounds right, New Yorker. - Yeah, New
Yorker. so, guy, tried look up, couldn't keep eyes
closed them. so, father started testing people. seemed
rough correlation capacity keep eyes up, closed
measured hypnotizability. - people listening [stutters], watching


video. So, Spiegel Eye-Roll Test, involves looking ceiling. So, tilting
head back, tilting chin back looking ceiling now. also
directing eyes upward eyes open. eye roll test involves
then, closing eyelids eyes open. - open. - whether not,
eyes roll back said it, see sclera, white part. - see sclera,
white part. - means you're, hypnotizable moderately hypnotizable. -
Right. - Whereas eyes move see iris, colored part eye
eyes close, less hypnotizable. - Right. - can look online there, just
put Spiegel Eye-Roll Test find it. also going actual
example hypnosis video later. - Right. So, asking brain something
difficult, keep eyes closing eyelids. contradictory signals
third, fourth sixth cranial nerve nuclei control eye movement. - said
third- - Fourth six, - Yup. - cranial nerve nuclei. suspending one
activity, asking another eye movements lot levels
consciousness. periaqueductal gray, surrounds cranial nerve nuclei.
close eyes sleep, rapid eye movement dream.
drugs, affect level consciousness, can affect eyes eye movements,
either dilation contraction pupils, depending whether stimulant
opioid. - Stimulants, make pupils big. - Big, right? - Yeah. Like cocaine,
amphetamine. - Right, exactly. - Things sort. - opioids, get constricted
pupils. - parents looking kids coming door late night,
looking substance abuse. - right. - Yeah. - So, something
eyes lot level consciousness. mean, obviously, close
eyes go sleep, rapid eye movement dreaming.
So, not surprising. old Zen practice called, looking third eye.
think part reason happens is, looking inside like
third eye two forehead. think
visual creatures, pretty pathetic physical point view. Many animals
can outrun us, outs smell us eagles read newsprint hundred yards
can't. So, major defensive sensory input vision. animals,
predator animals eyes front head, good,
detailed vision prey. Whereas prey animals like deer, eyes side
head. So, don't see things well, much bigger range potential
see threat. mainly use, fact, interesting, social


anthropologists say, gather do, coastlines edge
forest something, got protection back. Something can
attack one side big vision might threaten you.
tend attracted kinds physical situations, so- - Yeah, love vistas. -
love vistas, right. - Vistas calming. take us panoramic
vision. - right. - didn't know this, turns scenic spots
location national parks people naturally aggregated was-
makes sense. - Sure. - But, signs locations built around, people's
tendency animals tendencies. - Oh, really [indistinct]? - aggregate there. Yeah,
interesting book history national parks says, didn't
give research study support it, no Google Maps, obviously. -
interesting. - Yeah, panorama visual boundaries really interesting. think,
eyes, know, two pieces central nervous system brain,
outside the- - Right. used say eyes outside skull neuro-
ophthalmologist wrote vehemently pointed outside
cranial vault, so, know. outside cranial vault two pieces
brain there. so, mentioned cranial nerves, three, four six.
isn't neuroanatomy course maybe go little deeper there. So, said
contradictory activity, looking controlled one set cranial nerves.
closing eyelids, controlled another cranial nerve. - No,
one. think six close eyes, activate, no, facial,
guess facial nerve. 7, yeah. - 7, yeah. - looking up, activating
muscles force eyes look up. closing eyelids normally relaxes
those, relaxes upper movement, eyes closed don't
need it. breaking usual customary pattern. - like rubbing the, -
Right. - hey, can't even it, see like the, - Right. [Andrew David laughing] -
exactly right. - Rubbing tummy patting head. bit
conflict there, - Right. - clinically, good probe you, - has. -
father. So, Spiegel senior Spiegel junior? - Spiegel senior. -
developed Spiegel Eye-Roll Test. - key issue this, normally
close eyes also, going sleep. not worried going
world anymore. Here, maintaining resting alertness. So, focusing
turning inward. unusual state. Normally close eyes periodically,
to, close eyes period time, normally go


sleep not worried detecting risk threat. So, interesting state
turning inward, basically, looking up, shutting eyes
allowing whatever happens outside happen focusing
going inward. So, think signal brain turn inward. - interesting.
meditation course, done eyes open almost always done
eyes closed. - Yes, right. - interesting. So, can quickly determine
whether not someone highly hypnotizable. - Right. - not hypnotizable.
said two thirds people can hypnotized. - Right. - Obviously third cannot.
within two thirds can, range, said 15% people fall
this, highly hypnotizable category. - Right, correct. - seem member
of. - Yeah. - And, repeated use self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis, increase
change hypnotizability, can access first place? - say
general, may increase little bit, not hell lot, not worth effort
increase hypnotizability point. worth trying deal problem,
dealing with. So, can get better using level have.
study done tried train people hypnotizable
obviously, there're subjective behavioral components test, can learn
little better them. found reanalyze data,
account three times final score, based initial hypnotizability
measurement, rather whether not trained better. So,
can improve little

01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)

not worth trouble. - Got it. Along lines eyes eye movements, lot
interest EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. -
Shapiro working, wasn't Stanford directly, local
Stanford. - Yeah. - think Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - thoughts
EMDR? useful, think less useful? things
EMDR combined make useful? listeners podcast
come to, think, come podcast range backgrounds interests. me,
makes sense EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given newer
data can suppress amygdala activity animals animal models
humans well. really hasn't explored much, neurally. heard things like,


coordinates two sides brain, it, just throwaway. don't think
evidence that, coordinating two sides brain better not
coordinating. wouldn't speaking right now two sides brain, well
correlated. - Yeah. - language lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - heard
mimics, rapid eye movements sleep, actually doesn't. So, - Right. -
heard people talk positive experiences EMDR.
thoughts EMDR? - Yeah, good comment one recent
podcasts. tell you, one way sort think bemused point view,
old, mentioned earlier, oldest sort idea hypnotic induction,
dangling watch, right? [indistinct] watch. And, fact, enough concern
automobiles invented, movement prevent
installing windshield wipers people afraid hypnotized,
watched windshield wipers go back forth car. Now, turns
fortunately that, tend not look windshield wipers. keep looking
windshield. so, windshield wipers today. movement is,
exactly used hypnotic induction. think lot hypnosis EMDR. - Ah. -
think, combination exposure based treatments, use
EMDR think it. tend not process experience much just
physical part it, personally think drawback. And, every study seen
dismantling study. no question people go EMDR, many
get better trauma related problems VA big program using
on. every program dismantled, going treatment
lateral eye movement, shown lateral eye movement, doesn't add
anything it. toward end career, Francine [indistinct]

things. So, tend think that, EMDR another form exposure based therapy
trauma, implied exception possible new data, certainly
doesn't with, rapid eye movement sleep. don't think moving eyes
issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put
weight this, going re-injure ankle example, simply mean
body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat
something coming opportunity something ameliorate situation. So,
not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding
happening. face also say, opportunity
something it. minute realistically enha- doesn't mean,
imagine away heart attack. means figure rehabilitate heart attack


broken leg something like way get much control

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body
floating, safe comfortable. Now, picture Mary sit feeling sadness
no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,
watch it, try [stutters]. work enjoying together shows
breathing patterns may increase sympathetic arousal may decrease. may
[indistinct] cyclic sighing seems to, actually, time spent exhaling
inhaling. reason believe induces parasympathetic activity,
'cause increasing pressure chest therefore allowing heart slow
blood returned atrium easily. use it. ask people
take deep breath part induction slowly exhale. partly
result research together, emphasizing slow exhale more, part
[stutters], enhance idea induction period relaxation, 'cause
think inducing perhaps perceiving well. So, no,
absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go
automatically can control it. so, kind way us demonstrate
ourselves, greater ways modulating internal state. So, can either it,
thinking it, way pain control hypnosis can
extent, taking charge breathing things will produce change
want see happen body. So, like right margin,
can enhance, me, like way augmenting hypnosis,
medication, think powerful way that. - Great, really excited see
goes. - Yes. - Breathing, vision, bodily states clearly the-
directed mental focus, seem key elements hypnosis. missing


ingredients? - Yeah, think right. - It's- - Breathing, vision, - Breathing, vision,
change vision don't, know, typically physically relaxed
state, frankly people peak performance, including physical athletic
performance musical performance hypnotic states too. talked
classical pianists say, not thinking, start thinking fingers
now, screw up. floating piano, thinking tone want
feel exuding instrument. hypnotic like state too. many athletes
peak performance, just flowing it. not thinking step step,
doing? best working
giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much
always you. can people learn about, can get
hypnotized? mentioned Reveri, put link it, R-E-V-E-R-I.com way
access that. - Reveri app app store, way. reveri.com
website, can get download Reveri app app
store. - Great. So, currently apple, hopefully soon, also Android,
meantime, people interested exploring clinical hypnosis, working
somebody similar? centralized resource people can go find, really
well-trained hypnotists? - two good professional organizations will help
that. One society clinical experimental hypnosis. think
sceh.us their- - Okay, look provide link. - American society
clinical hypnosis, provide referral services professionals. can look
up. just say general, look someone licensed trained
primary professional discipline, psychiatry, psychology, medicine, dentistry

mysterious people struggling lot things, also think people
really excited about, applying tools like hypnosis perform better, feel better mentally
physically. pointed us tremendous amount resources
tools work already demonstrated work. just, thank
you. know professional commitment life benefit. So, thank
so. - Well, thank you, real joy collaborating
using precision knowledge neuroanatomy, neurobiology
address problems often people disciplined primary
neurobiological end, aren't interested are. so, really pleasure
try bring together know different perspectives build

00:16:45 Stage Hypnosis

want understand better. want see can do. Stage hypnotists
drive nuts. make fools people. one. case father
involved. got call from, Columbia, got call, Spiegel, got
come see woman, ER. kind weird upset state
happened. turned show stage hypnotist who,
way is, cycle around, know, beginning show,
don't just grab somebody say, this. get bunch people up.

discomfort, fear life. able get reoriented talk
going life. don't like stage hypnosis.
making fools people using fact, scares people
hypnosis. think losing control. gaining control. Self-hypnosis
way enhancing control, mind body. can work well,
gives kind cognitive flexibility, able shift sets easily.
give judging evaluating way usually see something
different point view. great therapeutic opportunity, misused,
danger too, scares people it. ability suspend
critical judgment just experience see happens. can
great therapeutic opportunity, somebody's misusing it, can way harm
people. plenty examples people, fantasies imposed them,
come think realities. not unusual days. So, ability that,
people learn recognize understand it, can tremendous therapeutic tool. -
stage hypnotized clinically hypnotized many times self-


hypnosis app. talk later. know plans hypnotize
today. done before. - Mm-hm. - [Andrew] hypnotizable
know. - Right. - talk about, one can gauge hypnotizability. - Sure.
- stage hypnosis, interesting. college, brought someone
dormitory and, recall one people selected. - Mm-hm. -
engaging bizarre behavior, right? wasn't thoroughly embarrassing,
pretty embarrassing. sent off stage, exiting, suddenly
screaming something planted suggestion sort. - Ah, mm-
hm. - told look pocket was, like a, think, torn
dollar bill. bunch things vague recollection of.

00:20:25 Neurobiology Hypnosis

- Mm-hm. raises set questions really boil to, biologist, always
think that, no events brain, processes. hypnosis, know
induction. one hypnotized, imagine. sounds like woman
example bird distraught New York City, failure exit
hypnotic state. know sorts brain areas active induction,
call deep hypnosis shutting off changing people exit
hypnosis. - Yes, do, studied that. interested that. so,
study selected highly non-hypnotizable people
comparison. hypnotize functional MRI scanner. found
three things characterized entry hypnotic state. first turning
activity dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. DACC central front-middle
part brain well know. part call salience network.
conflict detector. engaged work hear loud noise think
might gunshot, anterior cingulate cortex saying, hey, wait minute,
potential danger there. better pay attention it. So, compares
else going helps decide do.
can imagine, turning activity region, make less likely
distracted pulled whatever in. another study, found
highly hypnotizable people, even without hypnotized, functional
connectivity DACC, anterior cingulate cortex left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex. So, part key region executive control network. So,


engaging tasks, enacting plan, writing paper,
whatever doing. prefrontal cortex that. so,
coordinated, found functional connectivity. So, one up, other's
one down, other's down. coordination implies brain saying,
okay, go ahead, know doing. Carry plan. don't worry
possibilities. So, two things happen people hypnotized. One
DLPFC higher functional connectivity insula. Another part
salience network. part mind-body control system, sensitive
happening body. part pain network well, also region
brain where, can control things body wouldn't think could.
example, study years ago, took people highly
hypnotizable, hypnotized told them, went imaginary culinary tour. So,
eat favorite foods found that, increased gastric acid
secretion, like 87%. So, stomach acting though get,
mean, one woman, vivid halfway through, said,
stop, full, [laughs] eating imaginary- - never eaten- - never
eaten anything- - Actual food? - No. - Incredible. - got relax
think anything food drink. got like 40% decrease gastric acid
secretions. DLPFC insula, telling stomach getting
food not getting food. even, injected Pentagastrin,
triggers gastric acid release. even hypnosis condition, 19%
reduction gastric acid. So, brain amazing ability control going
body ways don't think ability control. just one
example. So, DLPFC insula connection. third thing happens,
relates stage, inverse functional connectivity
DLPFC posterior cingulate cortex. posterior cingulate part
default mode network. back brain. area whose activity goes
example, meditators. meditation, supposed selfless.
supposed to, [indistinct] self illusion, supposed let dissolve
just experience things. that, posterior cingulate decreasing
activity, inverse connection is, something not thinking
means me. may not even remember much it. do, don't care much
it. so, part dissociation occur hypnosis. So,
put things outside conscious awareness, don't worry means.


also adds cognitive flexibility. thinking, well, people like don't usually
this. may inhibit from, enacting new form psychotherapy example,
never done before. decreased activity part
brain reflects means, likely cognitively flexible
willing give try. one therapeutic advantages hypnosis well. -
Fascinating, really, going embarrass little bit. [David laughing]
positive sense, laboratory really one pioneered brain imaging
hypnotic states. And, sounds like it, understanding, correct? - Yeah,
mean, people, who've done excellent research too. - Sure. Pierre
Rainville Montreal several people,

00:26:04 ADHD

one leading labs neuroimaging hypnosis. - ask about,
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. get lot questions this. think lot
people just struggle holding attention nowadays, interference
phones devices. course, lot of, clinically legitimate ADHD there,
way describe, - Sure. - dorsal anterior cingulate salience
network conflict detector of, focusing something splitting
attention? distractable I? Seems relate extent activity
anterior cingulate cortex. people ADHD, display disruptions elements
networks hypnosis ever used to, self-hypnosis, be,
distinguish stage hypnosis, clinical self-hypnosis used enhance
people's ability focus hold attention? built component
hypnotic state. - great question. sort two ways think it,
terms enhancing focus, yes. helpful teaching people just prepare
mind narrow focus something. really engaged
reading something, writing pa- mean, that, sometimes thinking,
oh God, another hour. times hour will go think,
hey, great, that, feels game-like you, just assembling
parts puzzle putting 'em together. fun, just get absorbed,
me, hypnotic like experience, trouble, struggling,
sometimes things like self-hypnosis can help. not expert ADHD.
impression right, people constantly distracted


rather rigid. part easily distractable. upset
get distracted rather rigid want attend
can. think, way controlling this, distractibility, frankly. guess many
people ADHD, not hypnotizable, haven't studied it. So,
possible people disorder,

00:28:22 Hypnosis Stress & Sleep

training self-hypnosis might help, see hypnotizable
take there. - want return underlying neural networks
clinical applications but, sorts things aside asthma, used
hypnosis successfully others used clinical hypnosis for?
particular areas of, psychiatric challenges illnesses, guess called,
particularly amenable hypnotic treatment. - Yes, are. Hypnosis good
problem focused treatment. oldest western conception psychotherapy,
can used specific problems way helpful. found helpful
stress reduction. helping people deal, dealing stress days.
helpful, mind-body connection helpful part problem
stress perception. mentioned earlier sort good sense,
football game something, feel physical reaction. can reinforcing
thing. Wow, exciting, it. can also distracting. So, worried
getting COVID worried about, physical problem have.
notice body, body tenses up, start sweat. sympathetic
nervous system goes, heart rate goes up. notice think, oh
God, really bad. feel worse. So, like snowball rolling downhill.
feel worse body gets worse. Hypnosis can helpful
dissociating somatic reaction psychological reactions. So, teach people
imagine body floating somewhere safe comfortable like bath, lake, hot tub
floating space, picture problem stressing imaginary
screen, rule, no matter see screen, keep body
comfortable. So, point, still can't control stress, can control
physical reaction it. starts feeling control. least one
thing can manage. can use think visualize one
thing might stressor. So, hypnosis helpful controlling mind-


body interaction relation stress. helpful people get sleep.
lot fun that. getting emails people said, haven't slept right
15 years, now first time, listening app can sleep night.
helpful again, wake middle night, tell people, don't
look clock. arousal cue. wake more, picture whatever
thinking worrying imaginary screen body
floating. So, watch movie, keep body floating. many people can
use get back sleep. - using self-hypnosis sleep long time.
now Reveri app, talk relationship Reveri app
uses. find incredibly useful falling back asleep middle night.
raises question, found think understand correctly, one can self-
hypnosis daytime. issue comes later, like,
instance, self-hypnosis stress reduction, away stressful event prepare
one deal stress better. - Right. - hypnosis improving return sleep.
can done actually want go sleep. kind training
networks,

00:32:12 Hypnosis Strengthen Neural Connections

right? - right. - So, evidence that, brain networks actually form
stronger connections, people self-hypnosis time? - Well, rule
neurobiology know, neurons fire together wire together. - friend,
Carla Shatz. - Yes, Carla- - Not Donald Hebb, way. [David laughing] keep trying
to, widespread myth world unfortunately, internet,
that, fire together wire together said by, psychologist, Donald Hebb
Donald Hebb many important things, neurobiologist Carla Shatz- -
exactly right. - Who, Yes, Stanford also Berkeley Harvard. So, also
decent schools. - exactly right. - Stanford, said, fire together wire
together. deserves, - Right. - credit statement. Yeah,
repeated use self-hypnosis, one imagine networks getting
stronger. - think so. don't evidence yet, long term
potentiation provides pathway described program, number
times allow repeated activation network actually build new connections
work. least, even learning memory point view, memory


network associations. remember things. example like
give is, go back grade school see little tiny lockers
size wrong. suddenly flood memories obviously stored
there, just didn't think of. So, context association memory's about.
start acquire memories problem. So, one thing use hypnosis
treating phobias, example. problem people phobias, like
airplane phobias crossing bridge high, avoid
more, source associations memories fear. don't
good experiences 'cause avoid it. like get back horse fall
off kind thing. hypnosis, can start people able manage anxiety
enough can more, wider array experiences, start
network associations isn't negative may even positive. - almost
like a, sorry interrupt, ask. - Sure - almost like a, exposure therapy
done mind. - Yes. - always mind. mean, even exposure to,
snake phobia, don't, don't like snakes, don't think qualifies full
blown phobia. think healthy fear snakes. - Yeah. - if, say
snake phobia, typical approach in, be, cognitive behavioral approaches, right,
show picture snake, rubber snake, real snake.
Eventually person is, - Yeah. - holding boa constrictor something like that. -
[David] Right. - mind translate nervous system
signals. hypnosis, sounds like can give number positive experiences
without use props, without bring animals room. - Right,
I- - Drive someone across bridge, right? - Yes, woman,
successful business woman, high level corporation. terrible dog phobia.
imagine somebody brought dog room said, "what
doing?" see getting tense. said, "Well, waiting
see dog does." said, "If somebody works you, comes
office, freeze wait see did?" said, "Of course not,
tell 'em do." [laughs] said, "Well, immobilizing yourself, power
isn't dog you, so, imagine might engage dog
help control situation." said, "Thanks." reminds of, one
favorite stories hypnosis that, father seeing woman lived
Midtown Manhattan horrible dog phobia. dropped things, spill
coffee saw dog. time trips store, thought


least likely people walking dogs. - Now wouldn't possible, everyone
in- - [laughs] Everyone New York dog - like fleet French Bulldogs, -
Right, exactly. - taking New York City. - So, taught think dog
friend, neighbor dog, bring dog hold dog collar
make sure, gradually able stroke dog say, dog friend
distinguish wild tame animals. animals, afraid
[murmurs]. So, seemed better. called back three months later
asked her. "Well, calling?" son said. said, "Dr. Spiegel."
boy said, "That's weird." father said, "What's weird?" said, "Spiegel's
heat." bought dog, - love it. - named it, Spiegel. - love it. - Talk
transference. - love it. [David laughing]

00:37:19 Restructuring Trauma Narratives

really speaks power this. brings back issue. So,
different about, father case woman, terms
happened hypnosis allowed go completely terrified dogs
owning dog naming father? find amusing. - Yeah. -
different just two sitting talking it, right? know,
therapy, narrative huge component. - Right. - hypnosis narrative huge
component. - Right. - must that, brain state really different.
talk trauma minutes. think people trauma
phobias, certainly conversation it. might freeze up.
might lose articulation forth. different
state combines narrative, think allow underlying neural networks
engage change? 'Cause find fascinating a- Every attempt
dealing stress phobia clinical setting involves discussion
is. - Yes. - But, not talking medication introduced,
least not particular circumstances. - Right. - So, realize kind obvious
question like, difference brain activity, find incredible.
control variable brain state. not, spoken. - raising
couple important issues, Andrew. talked earlier systematic
desensitization, sort lay hierarchy things one time.
think unsystematic desensitization, changing mental states.


think evidence mental state change
therapeutic potential. seeing ketamine treating depression,
dissociogenic drug. know every morning wake up, problem,
know, made mistake reading nasty email 11:00 PM. didn't know
do. wake morning thinking, oh, idiot, yeah,
going do. So, just changing mental state, therapeutic potential. think
underestimate ability regulate change responses cognitively,
emotionally somatically flexible. so, things, right, follow similar
principles facing problem, seeing different point view. done
really, nice podcast trauma stress expose it,
not avoid it, talked before. find way reconnect it,
substitute something can make feel good, rather bad, activate
centers brain like mesolimbic reward system. so, hypnosis
can much faster. People don't think can can.
having, right now physical experience, thinking not feeling
bad used to. can powerful thing can hypnosis. So,
woman came see me, suffered attempted rape. getting dark,
coming back grocery store guy grabs wants get
apartment. outside apartment. starts fighting
winds basilar skull fracture. runs away. cops come, since hadn't
raped, left, weren't interested. wanted use hypnosis get
better image guy looked like, painful, upsetting thing. So,
quite hypnotizable. got floating. say, safe comfortable, now, nothing
can happen will harm body. left side screen, want
picture guy approaching happening. said, really,
light, getting dark. really can't see much facial features, recognize
something, hadn't allowed remember. gets upstairs, doesn't just
want rape me, going kill me. so, ways, seeing
even worse. So, thinking, good, Spiegel, made even frightened
before. pointed PTSD stress lecture, got
confront trauma, restructure understanding it. So, side
screen, picture, protect yourself? everybody
trauma situation engages strategy self protection. salience network
kicking in. said, "You know what?" surprised fighting hard.


didn't think would. so, realized one hand even worse
thought was. hand actually probably saved life.
so, way of, helping restructure experience trauma make
tolerable. helped her- didn't recog- couldn't identify guy,
helped restructure understand experience. something
can just talking, straight psychotherapy. sometimes can hell
lot faster efficiently using hypnosis. one randomized trial
Israel shows adding hypnosis PTSD treatment, actually improves
outcome. way accomplishing things understand broader
psychotherapy world, much quickly sometimes effectively. - Yeah,
sounds like going somewhat state one trying deal with,
dissociating state key. imagine, open
various podcasts. done lot analysis years. experienced
sessions, depending show them, might just get kind
laundry list happened opposed actually feeling anything, around
happened. - Right. - think people probably vary extent can
drop feeling states can depend day. can depend well
slept night on. - one thing might add, Andrew, - Yes. -
is, notion late Gordon Bower, just memorial Gordon
Stanford. died year ago. Brilliant cognitive psychologist, one founders
cognitive psychology Stanford great pitcher. almost became Major
League pitcher decided go grad school instead, glad did.
Gordon helped establish concept state dependent memory
certain mental state, enhance ability remember things it. sort
bad example drunk hides bottle can't remember
put gets drunk mental state. People go
dissociative states traumatized. way, hypnosis helping
remember deal memories better mental state
like happened. rape victims will tell you, floating
body, feeling sorry woman assaulted below. People traumatic
episodes, just say, know, blank out, don't know happening,
autopilot kind self hypnotic state. So, use hypnosis help
deal traumatic memory, making state in, right office
you, congruent state likely in, trauma happened.


think part helps facilitate treatment trauma related disorders. -
see.

00:45:14 Ketamine Therapy

makes ask, every question ask, 'cause really feel
almost like compulsion, dissociation traumatic episode is, part
adaptive strategy. - Right. - creates certain issues, creates problems, right?
something like ketamine, creates dissociative state, useful
treatment trauma? confused days colleague,
Karl Deisseroth, also podcast coworkers figured out,
okay, layer one networks neocortex, involved
dissociative state. starting gain understanding ketamine
works neural level. - Right. - seem, certain populations can
useful treatment. don't know, never tried it. don't know current status
is, legal. allowed least in, FDA approved use.
dissociative states useful element dissociation gave rise
trauma memory first place? - Well, yeah, Karl brilliant paper
nature he, rats humans one paper. showed
rhythmic discharge retrosplenial region, triggered ketamine.
rats actually showed dissociative like behavior, hot pad
ordinarily wouldn't didn't seem much pain paw.
male subject implanted electrodes- - Human, yeah. - human subject, yeah.
electrodes picked rhythmic activity. did,
report dissociative state. description was, like pilot
airplane. felt walking cockpit plane still flying
and- - sounds terrifying me. [David laughing] sounds terrify terrifying. -
thing- - want body, [David laughing] time, know. -
right but, point is, way principal, Andrew, like, principle said,
need re-confront traumatic situation can modulate associations
it. So, accept it, accept arousal, put boundaries around
figure can approach problem approach
problem different point view. So, not surprise- fact, studied,
people disassociated Loma Prieta earthquake Oakland-Berkeley


firestorm. - remember well. - Yeah. - Earthquakes follow me. move
south Northridge quake- - going keep away So, there'll one
later, afternoon. [David laughing] - starting dissociating. So, dissociation
compartmentalize experience, means point view treating trauma,
inhibition. don't engage it. like happened there. think
happens people, sometimes good able separate
recollection. somewhere. sight not mind.
effects you, can't deal it. can't reprocess it. think
one reason ketamine might work fact, allows keep, re-approach
dissociative experience way can start think something
it. just fact can turn off. also self-hypnosis
helpful. not something just comes happens you.
something can make happen. can control it, can something it. So,
feel less helpless control. essence trauma helplessness. not
fear, not pain. helplessness. become object. become just body.
don't control going on. not used that. discussed
breathing paper anticipation breathing. not whether breathe, inhale
exhale hold breath, think can inhale can't,
really upsetting, understandably. so, issue control hypnosis,
terrible reputation taking away control actually superb way enhancing
control mind body. - love reminds naming important.
almost wonder self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis called something
else, would've separated stage hypnosis way make
less scary, weird, complicated people embrace. But, - Yeah. - part reason
discussion is, great experiences hypnosis, seen
data, talking lot clinical examples. incredibly powerful boils
right neural brain states. - Right. - And,

00:50:07 Self-directed Hypnosis, Reveri

think years come, going become widespread along lines.
quickly, described examples people getting relief quickly. -
Right. - permanent, changes? need follow related
that, sure number people listening thinking, wonderful, love


get hypnotized number different things Dr. Spiegel somebody else expert
clinical hypnosis, might not access somebody similar
training. power? So, quickly work? long lasting
changes? then, necessary work clinical hypnotist? better
self-hypnosis forth? Maybe just give us contour
landscape directed self-directed treatment. - Well, typically, people
start coming see clinician like me. better see someone licensing
training professional discipline, medicine, psychology, dentistry, whatever. -
'Cause lot hypnotists there, just hypnotist. - Right. Just
hypnotists. - Oh, okay. - key issue is, somebody can really assess
problem make sure not, talking someone reducing chest
pain, rather getting coronary artery problem- - 'Cause real
issue there. - could, right. - hypnosis might adjust wouldn't deal
deeper underlying issue. - right. hand. typically use
people, often see twice periodically, not every week.
certainly not every day, pain problem hypnosis helpful pain.
so, is, identifying hypnotizable are. give standard
brief test ability experience hypnosis, going self-hypnosis
exercise deal problem, seeing respond it,
teaching themselves. old days, used use
iPhone record part session. play back hypnosis
experience. Now developed app, "Reveri," can teach people step
through, dealing pain, stress, focus, insomnia help people eat better
stop smoking. elements take 15 minutes elements just
take one two minutes people can refresh reinforce. - Two minute hypnosis,
[indistinct] one minute. - Yes. - Yeah. - one two, one two minutes
now, finding two thirds people find even just one minute
refresher, helps feel better. reporting, feel better. So, nice thing is,
know right away, whether likely help not. found, done
studies, looking hypnosis pain relief acute medical procedures.
randomized trial published Lancet, three conditions, people getting
arterial cutdowns chemoembolized tumors liver visualize renal artery
stenosis. don't use general anesthesia this. uncomfortable people
anxious three conditions. One standard care, push


button get opioids, IV. - surgery? - surgery. second
is, that, plus friendly nurse, comforting them. So, controlled
pleasant attention support. third was, taught self-hypnosis
pain control. So, feeling, can change temperature, body
cool, tingling, numb, floating ice water feeling comfortable. go
somewhere else, leave body go desert island enjoy yourself.
found that, two half hour procedure, hour half,
hypnosis group reduced pain 80%, compared standard, - Wow. care
group, using half amount opioids, fewer complications procedure
took 17 minutes less time average get done. not patient
relaxed. treatment staff. weren't dealing someone
struggling uncomfortable. measured anxiety thing.
hypnosis group, worried dead. no anxiety hour
half, saying, fine, know, fine. standard care
group, 5 10 anxiety scores point. So, published Lancet,
big randomized trial. drug that, every hospital country
using now, no industry push it. So, part helped us decide
needed help people, Reveri teach
provide interactive support it. it, question, although is,
work long term? 'Cause can acutely doesn't necessarily carry on. So,
around randomized trial women metastatic breast cancer.

felt fine. So, works becomes skill people acquire, can
tell right away, whether likely help them, working clinician now using
app ways helping learn use skill. So, nice thing will
know quickly, whether likely help not. is, can learn
yourself. - great will, again, there'll link Reveri caption,

00:56:53 Eliminating Obsessive Thoughts, Superstitions

- Great, thanks clarification. hopefully, time both, get asked lot
obsessive thoughts intrusive thoughts. also get asked lot OCD.
evidence hypnosis self-hypnosis can used for, dealing obsessive
thoughts? - Sometimes, obsessional people, just turn not
hypnotizable for, yeah, not random. tend controlling
thought, busy evaluating rather experiencing, so- - know people
like that. [David laughing] sounds like adaptive mindset lot professions. -
right. - get trained that, - Yeah. - school, obsess
exam, obsess the, - Yeah. - social interactions. mean, part
becoming functional human being. yet, can take us different- -
sometimes overdo it. mean, tell one example extreme situations, that,
know, judging, evaluating, not letting experience, including
emotionally. know somebody, listens tapes airplanes go down. So,
get black box listen it. said me, know- -
profession recreational- - No, profession. - Okay. -
did. 'Cause trying accident prevention handle things.
said worry people panicking, right? guys know
got 30 seconds 45 seconds just going
checklist. said, don't panic enough. taught do.
reason, good reason it. sometimes overdo it. painful
listen 'cause know going happen. So, kind balance
hit. sometimes get emotional absorbed not
enough sort see possibilities. can problem.
hand, sometimes rigid controlled don't let emotions guide
need protect protect others. So, say


general people OCD are, less hypnotizable side spectrum,
less likely allow engage any, typical example checking
OCD example, don't remember, whether locked door turned off
gas oven keep going back keep checking. So,
evaluative component brain, kind overrides experiential one sometimes
people can get benefit, not group select
likely respond self hypnotic approaches. - superstitions similar? -
Superstitions, think more, people hypnotizable, keep
getting caught things like superstitions there, imagination supplants
reality. seen lot happening recently. think there,
possible helped learning sort see put context, see
different point view. - developed pretty vicious superstition,
college hard break, actually. always feel, talk clinicians,
reveal certain things pathology. - Please do. - so- - get
bill later. - Thank you, yes, part reason arranged this. [David laughing] No,
just kidding. yeah, did. habit knocking wood things noticed
started to, sneak knocking wood every 'cause didn't want
people think often. started realize that, becoming
little bit reflex. saw incredible video Bence Olveczky's lab
Harvard. studies motor patterns. rats press different
sequences levers turn dials order get pellet food. that,
start introduce behaviors nothing actual lever
pressing, like start scratching hind quarters things like that. hat,
heads, excuse me, don't wear hats flipping ears. just like
pitcher throwing baseball. this, - Oh, yeah. - start incorporate
motor behaviors unrelated outcome, mind somehow starts think
necessary outcome. incorporate it. So, decided
break simply forcing not week. - Mm-hm. just
seemed like ridiculous, - [Both] thing do. Yeah, well- - Knock wood. - call
response prevention works. is, set new context
brain, get outcome want, devoid extraneous behavior. - Yeah,
knew nuts, right. knew illogical. - Right.

01:01:50 ‘Hypnotizability’, Spiegel Eye-roll Test



- somehow things take meaning. - [David] Right. - So, talked about,
utility hypnosis stress reduction, phobias, pain, possibly, don't know for,
things like ADHD OCD, just will depend hypnotizability. - Right. - talked
beautiful study the, metastatic breast cancer outcome patients.
Hypnotizability clearly key variable. - Yes. - please tell us,
hypnotizability is, evaluated Spiegel Eye-Roll Test is? - Okay,
sure. So, hypnotizability just capacity hypnotic experiences.
test called hypnotic conduction profile. give highly structured hypnotic
experience. old tradition clinical hypnosis was, try bunch
different things, talking, walking upstairs downstairs images time
say breathing subject that. change
clinician, less can make variation outcome. take
long time, know, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. just view kind complex,
not effective way assessing person's hypnotic capacity. know
peak period hypnotizability human life, latency years childhood. So,
every eight year old trance time. call 'em dinner, don't
hear ya, thing. childhood wonderful
experience. Work play thing. try make little
adults, think terrible mistake. Everything fun them. enjoy learning,
enjoy everything. - age this- - like 6 10, 6 11.
playful, enjoy everything. Everything sort game fun try
make miserable them, got it. when, Piaget called,
adult cognitive framework, learn abstract concepts, learn even one
bottle looks bigger other, can equal volume. so, imposing
logic, growing DLPFC point imposing cognitive structure
experience. people start lose hypnotic ability. time
early 20s, hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed. study done
Stanford, Ernest Hillard, Phil Zimbardo this, looking at, tracked
students psych one, hypnotizability measured retested
blindly 25 years later. test, retest correlation was, want guess
was? - guessing it's, don't know, 0.6 something. - Yeah, close. 0.7, IQ
0.6, 25 year interval. - Wow. - So, stable IQ 25
year interval. So, point, are. factors


lead that? Well, means that, third adults just
not hypnotizable. Two thirds are, 15% extremely hypnotizable can
measure give number 0 10. useful.
patients it, say, look, sorry, not hypnotizable going
something else. Medication, systematic desensitization, mindfulness, things
hypnotizable, just go it. don't lot explaining. People
low moderate hypnotizable, like explanations doing,
can still get benefits. So, helps guide nature treatment
people. Now, eye roll is, father used use eye fixation induction, used
say, look ceiling now close eyes looking up. very,
yes, very- - Yeah [indistinct] [laughs]. - noticed two patients back
back. one woman seen work with, hysterical seizures.
just suddenly start shaking. And- - Real epileptic seizures? - No, pseudo
epileptic seizures. - see, hysteria. - Hysteria, although people both,
the, people, real epilepsy becomes framework gets elaborated on,
stressed, seizures. just pseudo epilepsy, no EEG
abnormalities. really something watch. husband move
work bench near door, started seizure, run home
try help it. bad. noticed
did, looked up, one seizure events, see
sclera, don't see Iris anymore. start seize. great thing
her. taught seizures. Everybody else telling stop.
made one. hypnotized her, [indistinct] go back last time
one sure enough, start shake. gradually make smaller
smaller. So, learning control, access, like
PTSD, confront, don't avoid it, don't suppress it. confront figure
deal it. next patient rigid obsessional businessman
wanted stop controlling [chuckles], reminded me,
New Yorker cartoon driver, comes yield sign yells, "Never!"
always [indistinct]. - sounds right, New Yorker. - Yeah, New
Yorker. so, guy, tried look up, couldn't keep eyes
closed them. so, father started testing people. seemed
rough correlation capacity keep eyes up, closed
measured hypnotizability. - people listening [stutters], watching


video. So, Spiegel Eye-Roll Test, involves looking ceiling. So, tilting
head back, tilting chin back looking ceiling now. also
directing eyes upward eyes open. eye roll test involves
then, closing eyelids eyes open. - open. - whether not,
eyes roll back said it, see sclera, white part. - see sclera,
white part. - means you're, hypnotizable moderately hypnotizable. -
Right. - Whereas eyes move see iris, colored part eye
eyes close, less hypnotizable. - Right. - can look online there, just
put Spiegel Eye-Roll Test find it. also going actual
example hypnosis video later. - Right. So, asking brain something
difficult, keep eyes closing eyelids. contradictory signals
third, fourth sixth cranial nerve nuclei control eye movement. - said
third- - Fourth six, - Yup. - cranial nerve nuclei. suspending one
activity, asking another eye movements lot levels
consciousness. periaqueductal gray, surrounds cranial nerve nuclei.
close eyes sleep, rapid eye movement dream.
drugs, affect level consciousness, can affect eyes eye movements,
either dilation contraction pupils, depending whether stimulant
opioid. - Stimulants, make pupils big. - Big, right? - Yeah. Like cocaine,
amphetamine. - Right, exactly. - Things sort. - opioids, get constricted
pupils. - parents looking kids coming door late night,
looking substance abuse. - right. - Yeah. - So, something
eyes lot level consciousness. mean, obviously, close
eyes go sleep, rapid eye movement dreaming.
So, not surprising. old Zen practice called, looking third eye.
think part reason happens is, looking inside like
third eye two forehead. think
visual creatures, pretty pathetic physical point view. Many animals
can outrun us, outs smell us eagles read newsprint hundred yards
can't. So, major defensive sensory input vision. animals,
predator animals eyes front head, good,
detailed vision prey. Whereas prey animals like deer, eyes side
head. So, don't see things well, much bigger range potential
see threat. mainly use, fact, interesting, social


anthropologists say, gather do, coastlines edge
forest something, got protection back. Something can
attack one side big vision might threaten you.
tend attracted kinds physical situations, so- - Yeah, love vistas. -
love vistas, right. - Vistas calming. take us panoramic
vision. - right. - didn't know this, turns scenic spots
location national parks people naturally aggregated was-
makes sense. - Sure. - But, signs locations built around, people's
tendency animals tendencies. - Oh, really [indistinct]? - aggregate there. Yeah,
interesting book history national parks says, didn't
give research study support it, no Google Maps, obviously. -
interesting. - Yeah, panorama visual boundaries really interesting. think,
eyes, know, two pieces central nervous system brain,
outside the- - Right. used say eyes outside skull neuro-
ophthalmologist wrote vehemently pointed outside
cranial vault, so, know. outside cranial vault two pieces
brain there. so, mentioned cranial nerves, three, four six.
isn't neuroanatomy course maybe go little deeper there. So, said
contradictory activity, looking controlled one set cranial nerves.
closing eyelids, controlled another cranial nerve. - No,
one. think six close eyes, activate, no, facial,
guess facial nerve. 7, yeah. - 7, yeah. - looking up, activating
muscles force eyes look up. closing eyelids normally relaxes
those, relaxes upper movement, eyes closed don't
need it. breaking usual customary pattern. - like rubbing the, -
Right. - hey, can't even it, see like the, - Right. [Andrew David laughing] -
exactly right. - Rubbing tummy patting head. bit
conflict there, - Right. - clinically, good probe you, - has. -
father. So, Spiegel senior Spiegel junior? - Spiegel senior. -
developed Spiegel Eye-Roll Test. - key issue this, normally
close eyes also, going sleep. not worried going
world anymore. Here, maintaining resting alertness. So, focusing
turning inward. unusual state. Normally close eyes periodically,
to, close eyes period time, normally go


sleep not worried detecting risk threat. So, interesting state
turning inward, basically, looking up, shutting eyes
allowing whatever happens outside happen focusing
going inward. So, think signal brain turn inward. - interesting.
meditation course, done eyes open almost always done
eyes closed. - Yes, right. - interesting. So, can quickly determine
whether not someone highly hypnotizable. - Right. - not hypnotizable.
said two thirds people can hypnotized. - Right. - Obviously third cannot.
within two thirds can, range, said 15% people fall
this, highly hypnotizable category. - Right, correct. - seem member
of. - Yeah. - And, repeated use self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis, increase
change hypnotizability, can access first place? - say
general, may increase little bit, not hell lot, not worth effort
increase hypnotizability point. worth trying deal problem,
dealing with. So, can get better using level have.
study done tried train people hypnotizable
obviously, there're subjective behavioral components test, can learn
little better them. found reanalyze data,
account three times final score, based initial hypnotizability
measurement, rather whether not trained better. So,
can improve little

01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)

not worth trouble. - Got it. Along lines eyes eye movements, lot
interest EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. -
Shapiro working, wasn't Stanford directly, local
Stanford. - Yeah. - think Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - thoughts
EMDR? useful, think less useful? things
EMDR combined make useful? listeners podcast
come to, think, come podcast range backgrounds interests. me,
makes sense EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given newer
data can suppress amygdala activity animals animal models
humans well. really hasn't explored much, neurally. heard things like,


coordinates two sides brain, it, just throwaway. don't think
evidence that, coordinating two sides brain better not
coordinating. wouldn't speaking right now two sides brain, well
correlated. - Yeah. - language lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - heard
mimics, rapid eye movements sleep, actually doesn't. So, - Right. -
heard people talk positive experiences EMDR.
thoughts EMDR? - Yeah, good comment one recent
podcasts. tell you, one way sort think bemused point view,
old, mentioned earlier, oldest sort idea hypnotic induction,
dangling watch, right? [indistinct] watch. And, fact, enough concern
automobiles invented, movement prevent
installing windshield wipers people afraid hypnotized,
watched windshield wipers go back forth car. Now, turns
fortunately that, tend not look windshield wipers. keep looking
windshield. so, windshield wipers today. movement is,
exactly used hypnotic induction. think lot hypnosis EMDR. - Ah. -
think, combination exposure based treatments, use
EMDR think it. tend not process experience much just
physical part it, personally think drawback. And, every study seen
dismantling study. no question people go EMDR, many
get better trauma related problems VA big program using
on. every program dismantled, going treatment
lateral eye movement, shown lateral eye movement, doesn't add
anything it. toward end career, Francine [indistinct]

things. So, tend think that, EMDR another form exposure based therapy
trauma, implied exception possible new data, certainly
doesn't with, rapid eye movement sleep. don't think moving eyes
issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put
weight this, going re-injure ankle example, simply mean
body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat
something coming opportunity something ameliorate situation. So,
not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding
happening. face also say, opportunity
something it. minute realistically enha- doesn't mean,
imagine away heart attack. means figure rehabilitate heart attack


broken leg something like way get much control

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body
floating, safe comfortable. Now, picture Mary sit feeling sadness
no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described

ingredients? - Yeah, think right. - It's- - Breathing, vision, - Breathing, vision,
change vision don't, know, typically physically relaxed
state, frankly people peak performance, including physical athletic
performance musical performance hypnotic states too. talked
classical pianists say, not thinking, start thinking fingers
now, screw up. floating piano, thinking tone want
feel exuding instrument. hypnotic like state too. many athletes
peak performance, just flowing it. not thinking step step,
doing? best working
giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much
always you. can people learn about, can get
hypnotized? mentioned Reveri, put link it, R-E-V-E-R-I.com way

nurse telling me, Spiegel, next patient asthmatic room 437
something. just following, sound wheezes hall. go
room, 16 year old girl, knuckles white, bolt upright bed, struggling breath.
can hear wheezing. twice subcutaneous epinephrine, didn't work.
thinking general anesthesia starting steroids. mother's
crying. said, don't know else do. said, want learn
breathing exercise? nods. got hypnotized. realized
hadn't gotten asthma course yet. So, made something complex. said,
breath take will little deeper little easier. within five minutes,
lying back bed. knuckles aren't white, not wheezing. mother
stopped crying. nurse ran room, intern, intern comes find
figured going pat back say, nice job, Spiegel. said,
nurse filed complaint nursing supervisor violated
Massachusetts law hypnotizing, minor without parental consent. thought, oh,
nice. doubt law like this. So, interns says, going
stop her. said, why? said, dangerous. said, going
give general anesthesia put steroids, talking dangerous?
said, well, it. said, tell what, take off case
want, not going tell patient mine, anything know not true. So,
battle weekend do, intern, chief resident,
attending, arguing it. Monday came back radical idea.
said, ask patient. don't think ever done children's
[chuckles] hospital before. said, oh, like this. hospitalized every
month three months status asthmaticus, one subsequent hospitalization
that, went study respiratory therapist. thought anything,
can help patient much, violate nonexistent Massachusetts law, frustrate
nursing supervisor, worth looking into. So, just kept it. discovered
were, classmates medical school, just read new issue
New England Journal new medication suggest. would, know,
surgeons say, look, can help guy pain anxiety, anything
neck, yours, it, Spiegel. So, fun able learn
help people way just otherwise not done. so, got
thinking fact that, born brain don't user's manual
it. don't use nearly well can. something research


too. so, thought,

00:16:45 Stage Hypnosis

want understand better. want see can do. Stage hypnotists
drive nuts. make fools people. one. case father
involved. got call from, Columbia, got call, Spiegel, got
come see woman, ER. kind weird upset state
happened. turned show stage hypnotist who,
way is, cycle around, know, beginning show,
don't just grab somebody say, this. get bunch people up.
[indistinct] testing, see people- get ones
hypnotizable. one. said, now little bird
hand, going play bird. starts cry scream.
just gets off stage, 'cause upsetting. wandering around New
York City middle night dissociated brought Columbia.
father saw her. still kind uncomfortable trance like state.
turned out, trophy wife wealthy guy. felt like bird
gilded cage. her, image just triggered sense of, dissatisfaction
discomfort, fear life. able get reoriented talk
going life. don't like stage hypnosis.
making fools people using fact, scares people
hypnosis. think losing control. gaining control. Self-hypnosis
way enhancing control, mind body. can work well,
gives kind cognitive flexibility, able shift sets easily.
give judging evaluating way usually see something
different point view. great therapeutic opportunity, misused,
danger too, scares people it. ability suspend
critical judgment just experience see happens. can
great therapeutic opportunity, somebody's misusing it, can way harm
people. plenty examples people, fantasies imposed them,
come think realities. not unusual days. So, ability that,
people learn recognize understand it, can tremendous therapeutic tool. -
stage hypnotized clinically hypnotized many times self-


hypnosis app. talk later. know plans hypnotize
today. done before. - Mm-hm. - [Andrew] hypnotizable
know. - Right. - talk about, one can gauge hypnotizability. - Sure.
- stage hypnosis, interesting. college, brought someone
dormitory and, recall one people selected. - Mm-hm. -
engaging bizarre behavior, right? wasn't thoroughly embarrassing,
pretty embarrassing. sent off stage, exiting, suddenly
screaming something planted suggestion sort. - Ah, mm-
hm. - told look pocket was, like a, think, torn
dollar bill. bunch things vague recollection of.

00:20:25 Neurobiology Hypnosis

- Mm-hm. raises set questions really boil to, biologist, always
think that, no events brain, processes. hypnosis, know
induction. one hypnotized, imagine. sounds like woman
example bird distraught New York City, failure exit
hypnotic state. know sorts brain areas active induction,
call deep hypnosis shutting off changing people exit
hypnosis. - Yes, do, studied that. interested that. so,
study selected highly non-hypnotizable people
comparison. hypnotize functional MRI scanner. found
three things characterized entry hypnotic state. first turning
activity dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. DACC central front-middle
part brain well know. part call salience network.
conflict detector. engaged work hear loud noise think
might gunshot, anterior cingulate cortex saying, hey, wait minute,
potential danger there. better pay attention it. So, compares
else going helps decide do.
can imagine, turning activity region, make less likely
distracted pulled whatever in. another study, found
highly hypnotizable people, even without hypnotized, functional
connectivity DACC, anterior cingulate cortex left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex. So, part key region executive control network. So,


engaging tasks, enacting plan, writing paper,
whatever doing. prefrontal cortex that. so,
coordinated, found functional connectivity. So, one up, other's
one down, other's down. coordination implies brain saying,
okay, go ahead, know doing. Carry plan. don't worry
possibilities. So, two things happen people hypnotized. One
DLPFC higher functional connectivity insula. Another part
salience network. part mind-body control system, sensitive
happening body. part pain network well, also region
brain where, can control things body wouldn't think could.
example, study years ago, took people highly
hypnotizable, hypnotized told them, went imaginary culinary tour. So,
eat favorite foods found that, increased gastric acid
secretion, like 87%. So, stomach acting though get,
mean, one woman, vivid halfway through, said,
stop, full, [laughs] eating imaginary- - never eaten- - never
eaten anything- - Actual food? - No. - Incredible. - got relax
think anything food drink. got like 40% decrease gastric acid
secretions. DLPFC insula, telling stomach getting
food not getting food. even, injected Pentagastrin,
triggers gastric acid release. even hypnosis condition, 19%
reduction gastric acid. So, brain amazing ability control going
body ways don't think ability control. just one
example. So, DLPFC insula connection. third thing happens,
relates stage, inverse functional connectivity
DLPFC posterior cingulate cortex. posterior cingulate part
default mode network. back brain. area whose activity goes
example, meditators. meditation, supposed selfless.
supposed to, [indistinct] self illusion, supposed let dissolve
just experience things. that, posterior cingulate decreasing
activity, inverse connection is, something not thinking
means me. may not even remember much it. do, don't care much
it. so, part dissociation occur hypnosis. So,
put things outside conscious awareness, don't worry means.


also adds cognitive flexibility. thinking, well, people like don't usually
this. may inhibit from, enacting new form psychotherapy example,
never done before. decreased activity part
brain reflects means, likely cognitively flexible
willing give try. one therapeutic advantages hypnosis well. -
Fascinating, really, going embarrass little bit. [David laughing]
positive sense, laboratory really one pioneered brain imaging
hypnotic states. And, sounds like it, understanding, correct? - Yeah,
mean, people, who've done excellent research too. - Sure. Pierre
Rainville Montreal several people,

00:26:04 ADHD

one leading labs neuroimaging hypnosis. - ask about,
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. get lot questions this. think lot
people just struggle holding attention nowadays, interference
phones devices. course, lot of, clinically legitimate ADHD there,
way describe, - Sure. - dorsal anterior cingulate salience
network conflict detector of, focusing something splitting
attention? distractable I? Seems relate extent activity
anterior cingulate cortex. people ADHD, display disruptions elements
networks hypnosis ever used to, self-hypnosis, be,
distinguish stage hypnosis, clinical self-hypnosis used enhance
people's ability focus hold attention? built component
hypnotic state. - great question. sort two ways think it,
terms enhancing focus, yes. helpful teaching people just prepare
mind narrow focus something. really engaged
reading something, writing pa- mean, that, sometimes thinking,
oh God, another hour. times hour will go think,
hey, great, that, feels game-like you, just assembling
parts puzzle putting 'em together. fun, just get absorbed,
me, hypnotic like experience, trouble, struggling,
sometimes things like self-hypnosis can help. not expert ADHD.
impression right, people constantly distracted


rather rigid. part easily distractable. upset
get distracted rather rigid want attend
can. think, way controlling this, distractibility, frankly. guess many
people ADHD, not hypnotizable, haven't studied it. So,
possible people disorder,

00:28:22 Hypnosis Stress & Sleep

training self-hypnosis might help, see hypnotizable
take there. - want return underlying neural networks
clinical applications but, sorts things aside asthma, used
hypnosis successfully others used clinical hypnosis for?
particular areas of, psychiatric challenges illnesses, guess called,
particularly amenable hypnotic treatment. - Yes, are. Hypnosis good
problem focused treatment. oldest western conception psychotherapy,
can used specific problems way helpful. found helpful
stress reduction. helping people deal, dealing stress days.
helpful, mind-body connection helpful part problem
stress perception. mentioned earlier sort good sense,
football game something, feel physical reaction. can reinforcing
thing. Wow, exciting, it. can also distracting. So, worried
getting COVID worried about, physical problem have.
notice body, body tenses up, start sweat. sympathetic
nervous system goes, heart rate goes up. notice think, oh
God, really bad. feel worse. So, like snowball rolling downhill.
feel worse body gets worse. Hypnosis can helpful
dissociating somatic reaction psychological reactions. So, teach people
imagine body floating somewhere safe comfortable like bath, lake, hot tub
floating space, picture problem stressing imaginary
screen, rule, no matter see screen, keep body
comfortable. So, point, still can't control stress, can control
physical reaction it. starts feeling control. least one
thing can manage. can use think visualize one
thing might stressor. So, hypnosis helpful controlling mind-


body interaction relation stress. helpful people get sleep.
lot fun that. getting emails people said, haven't slept right
15 years, now first time, listening app can sleep night.
helpful again, wake middle night, tell people, don't
look clock. arousal cue. wake more, picture whatever
thinking worrying imaginary screen body
floating. So, watch movie, keep body floating. many people can
use get back sleep. - using self-hypnosis sleep long time.
now Reveri app, talk relationship Reveri app
uses. find incredibly useful falling back asleep middle night.
raises question, found think understand correctly, one can self-
hypnosis daytime. issue comes later, like,
instance, self-hypnosis stress reduction, away stressful event prepare
one deal stress better. - Right. - hypnosis improving return sleep.
can done actually want go sleep. kind training
networks,

00:32:12 Hypnosis Strengthen Neural Connections

right? - right. - So, evidence that, brain networks actually form
stronger connections, people self-hypnosis time? - Well, rule
neurobiology know, neurons fire together wire together. - friend,
Carla Shatz. - Yes, Carla- - Not Donald Hebb, way. [David laughing] keep trying
to, widespread myth world unfortunately, internet,
that, fire together wire together said by, psychologist, Donald Hebb
Donald Hebb many important things, neurobiologist Carla Shatz- -
exactly right. - Who, Yes, Stanford also Berkeley Harvard. So, also
decent schools. - exactly right. - Stanford, said, fire together wire
together. deserves, - Right. - credit statement. Yeah,
repeated use self-hypnosis, one imagine networks getting
stronger. - think so. don't evidence yet, long term
potentiation provides pathway described program, number
times allow repeated activation network actually build new connections
work. least, even learning memory point view, memory


network associations. remember things. example like
give is, go back grade school see little tiny lockers
size wrong. suddenly flood memories obviously stored
there, just didn't think of. So, context association memory's about.
start acquire memories problem. So, one thing use hypnosis
treating phobias, example. problem people phobias, like
airplane phobias crossing bridge high, avoid
more, source associations memories fear. don't
good experiences 'cause avoid it. like get back horse fall
off kind thing. hypnosis, can start people able manage anxiety
enough can more, wider array experiences, start
network associations isn't negative may even positive. - almost
like a, sorry interrupt, ask. - Sure - almost like a, exposure therapy
done mind. - Yes. - always mind. mean, even exposure to,
snake phobia, don't, don't like snakes, don't think qualifies full
blown phobia. think healthy fear snakes. - Yeah. - if, say
snake phobia, typical approach in, be, cognitive behavioral approaches, right,
show picture snake, rubber snake, real snake.
Eventually person is, - Yeah. - holding boa constrictor something like that. -
[David] Right. - mind translate nervous system
signals. hypnosis, sounds like can give number positive experiences
without use props, without bring animals room. - Right,
I- - Drive someone across bridge, right? - Yes, woman,
successful business woman, high level corporation. terrible dog phobia.
imagine somebody brought dog room said, "what
doing?" see getting tense. said, "Well, waiting
see dog does." said, "If somebody works you, comes
office, freeze wait see did?" said, "Of course not,
tell 'em do." [laughs] said, "Well, immobilizing yourself, power
isn't dog you, so, imagine might engage dog
help control situation." said, "Thanks." reminds of, one
favorite stories hypnosis that, father seeing woman lived
Midtown Manhattan horrible dog phobia. dropped things, spill
coffee saw dog. time trips store, thought


least likely people walking dogs. - Now wouldn't possible, everyone
in- - [laughs] Everyone New York dog - like fleet French Bulldogs, -
Right, exactly. - taking New York City. - So, taught think dog
friend, neighbor dog, bring dog hold dog collar
make sure, gradually able stroke dog say, dog friend
distinguish wild tame animals. animals, afraid
[murmurs]. So, seemed better. called back three months later
asked her. "Well, calling?" son said. said, "Dr. Spiegel."
boy said, "That's weird." father said, "What's weird?" said, "Spiegel's
heat." bought dog, - love it. - named it, Spiegel. - love it. - Talk
transference. - love it. [David laughing]

00:37:19 Restructuring Trauma Narratives

really speaks power this. brings back issue. So,
different about, father case woman, terms
happened hypnosis allowed go completely terrified dogs
owning dog naming father? find amusing. - Yeah. -
different just two sitting talking it, right? know,
therapy, narrative huge component. - Right. - hypnosis narrative huge
component. - Right. - must that, brain state really different.
talk trauma minutes. think people trauma
phobias, certainly conversation it. might freeze up.
might lose articulation forth. different
state combines narrative, think allow underlying neural networks
engage change? 'Cause find fascinating a- Every attempt
dealing stress phobia clinical setting involves discussion
is. - Yes. - But, not talking medication introduced,
least not particular circumstances. - Right. - So, realize kind obvious
question like, difference brain activity, find incredible.
control variable brain state. not, spoken. - raising
couple important issues, Andrew. talked earlier systematic
desensitization, sort lay hierarchy things one time.
think unsystematic desensitization, changing mental states.


think evidence mental state change
therapeutic potential. seeing ketamine treating depression,
dissociogenic drug. know every morning wake up, problem,
know, made mistake reading nasty email 11:00 PM. didn't know
do. wake morning thinking, oh, idiot, yeah,
going do. So, just changing mental state, therapeutic potential. think
underestimate ability regulate change responses cognitively,
emotionally somatically flexible. so, things, right, follow similar
principles facing problem, seeing different point view. done
really, nice podcast trauma stress expose it,
not avoid it, talked before. find way reconnect it,
substitute something can make feel good, rather bad, activate
centers brain like mesolimbic reward system. so, hypnosis
can much faster. People don't think can can.
having, right now physical experience, thinking not feeling
bad used to. can powerful thing can hypnosis. So,
woman came see me, suffered attempted rape. getting dark,
coming back grocery store guy grabs wants get
apartment. outside apartment. starts fighting
winds basilar skull fracture. runs away. cops come, since hadn't
raped, left, weren't interested. wanted use hypnosis get
better image guy looked like, painful, upsetting thing. So,
quite hypnotizable. got floating. say, safe comfortable, now, nothing
can happen will harm body. left side screen, want
picture guy approaching happening. said, really,
light, getting dark. really can't see much facial features, recognize
something, hadn't allowed remember. gets upstairs, doesn't just
want rape me, going kill me. so, ways, seeing
even worse. So, thinking, good, Spiegel, made even frightened
before. pointed PTSD stress lecture, got
confront trauma, restructure understanding it. So, side
screen, picture, protect yourself? everybody
trauma situation engages strategy self protection. salience network
kicking in. said, "You know what?" surprised fighting hard.


didn't think would. so, realized one hand even worse
thought was. hand actually probably saved life.
so, way of, helping restructure experience trauma make
tolerable. helped her- didn't recog- couldn't identify guy,
helped restructure understand experience. something
can just talking, straight psychotherapy. sometimes can hell
lot faster efficiently using hypnosis. one randomized trial
Israel shows adding hypnosis PTSD treatment, actually improves
outcome. way accomplishing things understand broader
psychotherapy world, much quickly sometimes effectively. - Yeah,
sounds like going somewhat state one trying deal with,
dissociating state key. imagine, open
various podcasts. done lot analysis years. experienced
sessions, depending show them, might just get kind
laundry list happened opposed actually feeling anything, around
happened. - Right. - think people probably vary extent can
drop feeling states can depend day. can depend well
slept night on. - one thing might add, Andrew, - Yes. -
is, notion late Gordon Bower, just memorial Gordon
Stanford. died year ago. Brilliant cognitive psychologist, one founders
cognitive psychology Stanford great pitcher. almost became Major
League pitcher decided go grad school instead, glad did.
Gordon helped establish concept state dependent memory
certain mental state, enhance ability remember things it. sort
bad example drunk hides bottle can't remember
put gets drunk mental state. People go
dissociative states traumatized. way, hypnosis helping
remember deal memories better mental state
like happened. rape victims will tell you, floating
body, feeling sorry woman assaulted below. People traumatic
episodes, just say, know, blank out, don't know happening,
autopilot kind self hypnotic state. So, use hypnosis help
deal traumatic memory, making state in, right office
you, congruent state likely in, trauma happened.


think part helps facilitate treatment trauma related disorders. -
see.

00:45:14 Ketamine Therapy

makes ask, every question ask, 'cause really feel
almost like compulsion, dissociation traumatic episode is, part
adaptive strategy. - Right. - creates certain issues, creates problems, right?
something like ketamine, creates dissociative state, useful
treatment trauma? confused days colleague,
Karl Deisseroth, also podcast coworkers figured out,
okay, layer one networks neocortex, involved
dissociative state. starting gain understanding ketamine
works neural level. - Right. - seem, certain populations can
useful treatment. don't know, never tried it. don't know current status
is, legal. allowed least in, FDA approved use.
dissociative states useful element dissociation gave rise
trauma memory first place? - Well, yeah, Karl brilliant paper
nature he, rats humans one paper. showed
rhythmic discharge retrosplenial region, triggered ketamine.
rats actually showed dissociative like behavior, hot pad
ordinarily wouldn't didn't seem much pain paw.
male subject implanted electrodes- - Human, yeah. - human subject, yeah.
electrodes picked rhythmic activity. did,
report dissociative state. description was, like pilot
airplane. felt walking cockpit plane still flying
and- - sounds terrifying me. [David laughing] sounds terrify terrifying. -
thing- - want body, [David laughing] time, know. -
right but, point is, way principal, Andrew, like, principle said,
need re-confront traumatic situation can modulate associations
it. So, accept it, accept arousal, put boundaries around
figure can approach problem approach
problem different point view. So, not surprise- fact, studied,
people disassociated Loma Prieta earthquake Oakland-Berkeley


firestorm. - remember well. - Yeah. - Earthquakes follow me. move
south Northridge quake- - going keep away So, there'll one
later, afternoon. [David laughing] - starting dissociating. So, dissociation
compartmentalize experience, means point view treating trauma,
inhibition. don't engage it. like happened there. think
happens people, sometimes good able separate
recollection. somewhere. sight not mind.
effects you, can't deal it. can't reprocess it. think
one reason ketamine might work fact, allows keep, re-approach
dissociative experience way can start think something
it. just fact can turn off. also self-hypnosis
helpful. not something just comes happens you.
something can make happen. can control it, can something it. So,
feel less helpless control. essence trauma helplessness. not
fear, not pain. helplessness. become object. become just body.
don't control going on. not used that. discussed
breathing paper anticipation breathing. not whether breathe, inhale
exhale hold breath, think can inhale can't,
really upsetting, understandably. so, issue control hypnosis,
terrible reputation taking away control actually superb way enhancing
control mind body. - love reminds naming important.
almost wonder self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis called something
else, would've separated stage hypnosis way make
less scary, weird, complicated people embrace. But, - Yeah. - part reason
discussion is, great experiences hypnosis, seen
data, talking lot clinical examples. incredibly powerful boils
right neural brain states. - Right. - And,

00:50:07 Self-directed Hypnosis, Reveri

think years come, going become widespread along lines.
quickly, described examples people getting relief quickly. -
Right. - permanent, changes? need follow related
that, sure number people listening thinking, wonderful, love


get hypnotized number different things Dr. Spiegel somebody else expert
clinical hypnosis, might not access somebody similar
training. power? So, quickly work? long lasting
changes? then, necessary work clinical hypnotist? better
self-hypnosis forth? Maybe just give us contour
landscape directed self-directed treatment. - Well, typically, people
start coming see clinician like me. better see someone licensing
training professional discipline, medicine, psychology, dentistry, whatever. -
'Cause lot hypnotists there, just hypnotist. - Right. Just
hypnotists. - Oh, okay. - key issue is, somebody can really assess
problem make sure not, talking someone reducing chest
pain, rather getting coronary artery problem- - 'Cause real
issue there. - could, right. - hypnosis might adjust wouldn't deal
deeper underlying issue. - right. hand. typically use
people, often see twice periodically, not every week.
certainly not every day, pain problem hypnosis helpful pain.
so, is, identifying hypnotizable are. give standard
brief test ability experience hypnosis, going self-hypnosis
exercise deal problem, seeing respond it,
teaching themselves. old days, used use
iPhone record part session. play back hypnosis
experience. Now developed app, "Reveri," can teach people step
through, dealing pain, stress, focus, insomnia help people eat better
stop smoking. elements take 15 minutes elements just
take one two minutes people can refresh reinforce. - Two minute hypnosis,
[indistinct] one minute. - Yes. - Yeah. - one two, one two minutes
now, finding two thirds people find even just one minute
refresher, helps feel better. reporting, feel better. So, nice thing is,
know right away, whether likely help not. found, done
studies, looking hypnosis pain relief acute medical procedures.
randomized trial published Lancet, three conditions, people getting
arterial cutdowns chemoembolized tumors liver visualize renal artery
stenosis. don't use general anesthesia this. uncomfortable people
anxious three conditions. One standard care, push


button get opioids, IV. - surgery? - surgery. second
is, that, plus friendly nurse, comforting them. So, controlled
pleasant attention support. third was, taught self-hypnosis
pain control. So, feeling, can change temperature, body
cool, tingling, numb, floating ice water feeling comfortable. go
somewhere else, leave body go desert island enjoy yourself.
found that, two half hour procedure, hour half,
hypnosis group reduced pain 80%, compared standard, - Wow. care

hypnosis group, worried dead. no anxiety hour

00:56:53 Eliminating Obsessive Thoughts, Superstitions

- Great, thanks clarification. hopefully, time both, get asked lot
obsessive thoughts intrusive thoughts. also get asked lot OCD.
evidence hypnosis self-hypnosis can used for, dealing obsessive
thoughts? - Sometimes, obsessional people, just turn not
hypnotizable for, yeah, not random. tend controlling
thought, busy evaluating rather experiencing, so- - know people
like that. [David laughing] sounds like adaptive mindset lot professions. -
right. - get trained that, - Yeah. - school, obsess
exam, obsess the, - Yeah. - social interactions. mean, part
becoming functional human being. yet, can take us different- -
sometimes overdo it. mean, tell one example extreme situations, that,
know, judging, evaluating, not letting experience, including
emotionally. know somebody, listens tapes airplanes go down. So,
get black box listen it. said me, know- -
profession recreational- - No, profession. - Okay. -
did. 'Cause trying accident prevention handle things.
said worry people panicking, right? guys know
got 30 seconds 45 seconds just going
checklist. said, don't panic enough. taught do.
reason, good reason it. sometimes overdo it. painful
listen 'cause know going happen. So, kind balance
hit. sometimes get emotional absorbed not
enough sort see possibilities. can problem.
hand, sometimes rigid controlled don't let emotions guide
need protect protect others. So, say


general people OCD are, less hypnotizable side spectrum,
less likely allow engage any, typical example checking
OCD example, don't remember, whether locked door turned off
gas oven keep going back keep checking. So,
evaluative component brain, kind overrides experiential one sometimes
people can get benefit, not group select
likely respond self hypnotic approaches. - superstitions similar? -
Superstitions, think more, people hypnotizable, keep
getting caught things like superstitions there, imagination supplants
reality. seen lot happening recently. think there,
possible helped learning sort see put context, see
different point view. - developed pretty vicious superstition,
college hard break, actually. always feel, talk clinicians,
reveal certain things pathology. - Please do. - so- - get
bill later. - Thank you, yes, part reason arranged this. [David laughing] No,
just kidding. yeah, did. habit knocking wood things noticed
started to, sneak knocking wood every 'cause didn't want
people think often. started realize that, becoming
little bit reflex. saw incredible video Bence Olveczky's lab
Harvard. studies motor patterns. rats press different
sequences levers turn dials order get pellet food. that,
start introduce behaviors nothing actual lever
pressing, like start scratching hind quarters things like that. hat,
heads, excuse me, don't wear hats flipping ears. just like
pitcher throwing baseball. this, - Oh, yeah. - start incorporate
motor behaviors unrelated outcome, mind somehow starts think
necessary outcome. incorporate it. So, decided
break simply forcing not week. - Mm-hm. just
seemed like ridiculous, - [Both] thing do. Yeah, well- - Knock wood. - call
response prevention works. is, set new context
brain, get outcome want, devoid extraneous behavior. - Yeah,
knew nuts, right. knew illogical. - Right.

01:01:50 ‘Hypnotizability’, Spiegel Eye-roll Test



- somehow things take meaning. - [David] Right. - So, talked about,
utility hypnosis stress reduction, phobias, pain, possibly, don't know for,
things like ADHD OCD, just will depend hypnotizability. - Right. - talked
beautiful study the, metastatic breast cancer outcome patients.
Hypnotizability clearly key variable. - Yes. - please tell us,
hypnotizability is, evaluated Spiegel Eye-Roll Test is? - Okay,
sure. So, hypnotizability just capacity hypnotic experiences.
test called hypnotic conduction profile. give highly structured hypnotic
experience. old tradition clinical hypnosis was, try bunch
different things, talking, walking upstairs downstairs images time
say breathing subject that. change
clinician, less can make variation outcome. take
long time, know, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. just view kind complex,
not effective way assessing person's hypnotic capacity. know
peak period hypnotizability human life, latency years childhood. So,
every eight year old trance time. call 'em dinner, don't
hear ya, thing. childhood wonderful
experience. Work play thing. try make little
adults, think terrible mistake. Everything fun them. enjoy learning,
enjoy everything. - age this- - like 6 10, 6 11.
playful, enjoy everything. Everything sort game fun try
make miserable them, got it. when, Piaget called,
adult cognitive framework, learn abstract concepts, learn even one
bottle looks bigger other, can equal volume. so, imposing
logic, growing DLPFC point imposing cognitive structure
experience. people start lose hypnotic ability. time
early 20s, hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed. study done
Stanford, Ernest Hillard, Phil Zimbardo this, looking at, tracked
students psych one, hypnotizability measured retested
blindly 25 years later. test, retest correlation was, want guess
was? - guessing it's, don't know, 0.6 something. - Yeah, close. 0.7, IQ
0.6, 25 year interval. - Wow. - So, stable IQ 25
year interval. So, point, are. factors


lead that? Well, means that, third adults just
not hypnotizable. Two thirds are, 15% extremely hypnotizable can
measure give number 0 10. useful.
patients it, say, look, sorry, not hypnotizable going
something else. Medication, systematic desensitization, mindfulness, things
hypnotizable, just go it. don't lot explaining. People
low moderate hypnotizable, like explanations doing,
can still get benefits. So, helps guide nature treatment
people. Now, eye roll is, father used use eye fixation induction, used
say, look ceiling now close eyes looking up. very,
yes, very- - Yeah [indistinct] [laughs]. - noticed two patients back
back. one woman seen work with, hysterical seizures.
just suddenly start shaking. And- - Real epileptic seizures? - No, pseudo
epileptic seizures. - see, hysteria. - Hysteria, although people both,
the, people, real epilepsy becomes framework gets elaborated on,
stressed, seizures. just pseudo epilepsy, no EEG
abnormalities. really something watch. husband move
work bench near door, started seizure, run home
try help it. bad. noticed
did, looked up, one seizure events, see
sclera, don't see Iris anymore. start seize. great thing
her. taught seizures. Everybody else telling stop.
made one. hypnotized her, [indistinct] go back last time
one sure enough, start shake. gradually make smaller
smaller. So, learning control, access, like
PTSD, confront, don't avoid it, don't suppress it. confront figure
deal it. next patient rigid obsessional businessman
wanted stop controlling [chuckles], reminded me,
New Yorker cartoon driver, comes yield sign yells, "Never!"
always [indistinct]. - sounds right, New Yorker. - Yeah, New
Yorker. so, guy, tried look up, couldn't keep eyes
closed them. so, father started testing people. seemed
rough correlation capacity keep eyes up, closed
measured hypnotizability. - people listening [stutters], watching


video. So, Spiegel Eye-Roll Test, involves looking ceiling. So, tilting
head back, tilting chin back looking ceiling now. also
directing eyes upward eyes open. eye roll test involves
then, closing eyelids eyes open. - open. - whether not,
eyes roll back said it, see sclera, white part. - see sclera,
white part. - means you're, hypnotizable moderately hypnotizable. -
Right. - Whereas eyes move see iris, colored part eye
eyes close, less hypnotizable. - Right. - can look online there, just
put Spiegel Eye-Roll Test find it. also going actual
example hypnosis video later. - Right. So, asking brain something
difficult, keep eyes closing eyelids. contradictory signals
third, fourth sixth cranial nerve nuclei control eye movement. - said
third- - Fourth six, - Yup. - cranial nerve nuclei. suspending one
activity, asking another eye movements lot levels
consciousness. periaqueductal gray, surrounds cranial nerve nuclei.
close eyes sleep, rapid eye movement dream.
drugs, affect level consciousness, can affect eyes eye movements,
either dilation contraction pupils, depending whether stimulant
opioid. - Stimulants, make pupils big. - Big, right? - Yeah. Like cocaine,
amphetamine. - Right, exactly. - Things sort. - opioids, get constricted
pupils. - parents looking kids coming door late night,
looking substance abuse. - right. - Yeah. - So, something
eyes lot level consciousness. mean, obviously, close
eyes go sleep, rapid eye movement dreaming.
So, not surprising. old Zen practice called, looking third eye.
think part reason happens is, looking inside like
third eye two forehead. think
visual creatures, pretty pathetic physical point view. Many animals
can outrun us, outs smell us eagles read newsprint hundred yards
can't. So, major defensive sensory input vision. animals,
predator animals eyes front head, good,
detailed vision prey. Whereas prey animals like deer, eyes side
head. So, don't see things well, much bigger range potential
see threat. mainly use, fact, interesting, social


anthropologists say, gather do, coastlines edge
forest something, got protection back. Something can
attack one side big vision might threaten you.
tend attracted kinds physical situations, so- - Yeah, love vistas. -
love vistas, right. - Vistas calming. take us panoramic
vision. - right. - didn't know this, turns scenic spots
location national parks people naturally aggregated was-
makes sense. - Sure. - But, signs locations built around, people's
tendency animals tendencies. - Oh, really [indistinct]? - aggregate there. Yeah,
interesting book history national parks says, didn't
give research study support it, no Google Maps, obviously. -
interesting. - Yeah, panorama visual boundaries really interesting. think,
eyes, know, two pieces central nervous system brain,
outside the- - Right. used say eyes outside skull neuro-
ophthalmologist wrote vehemently pointed outside
cranial vault, so, know. outside cranial vault two pieces
brain there. so, mentioned cranial nerves, three, four six.
isn't neuroanatomy course maybe go little deeper there. So, said
contradictory activity, looking controlled one set cranial nerves.
closing eyelids, controlled another cranial nerve. - No,
one. think six close eyes, activate, no, facial,
guess facial nerve. 7, yeah. - 7, yeah. - looking up, activating
muscles force eyes look up. closing eyelids normally relaxes
those, relaxes upper movement, eyes closed don't
need it. breaking usual customary pattern. - like rubbing the, -
Right. - hey, can't even it, see like the, - Right. [Andrew David laughing] -
exactly right. - Rubbing tummy patting head. bit
conflict there, - Right. - clinically, good probe you, - has. -
father. So, Spiegel senior Spiegel junior? - Spiegel senior. -
developed Spiegel Eye-Roll Test. - key issue this, normally
close eyes also, going sleep. not worried going
world anymore. Here, maintaining resting alertness. So, focusing
turning inward. unusual state. Normally close eyes periodically,
to, close eyes period time, normally go


sleep not worried detecting risk threat. So, interesting state
turning inward, basically, looking up, shutting eyes
allowing whatever happens outside happen focusing
going inward. So, think signal brain turn inward. - interesting.
meditation course, done eyes open almost always done
eyes closed. - Yes, right. - interesting. So, can quickly determine
whether not someone highly hypnotizable. - Right. - not hypnotizable.
said two thirds people can hypnotized. - Right. - Obviously third cannot.
within two thirds can, range, said 15% people fall
this, highly hypnotizable category. - Right, correct. - seem member
of. - Yeah. - And, repeated use self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis, increase
change hypnotizability, can access first place? - say
general, may increase little bit, not hell lot, not worth effort
increase hypnotizability point. worth trying deal problem,
dealing with. So, can get better using level have.
study done tried train people hypnotizable
obviously, there're subjective behavioral components test, can learn
little better them. found reanalyze data,
account three times final score, based initial hypnotizability
measurement, rather whether not trained better. So,
can improve little

01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)

not worth trouble. - Got it. Along lines eyes eye movements, lot
interest EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. -
Shapiro working, wasn't Stanford directly, local
Stanford. - Yeah. - think Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - thoughts
EMDR? useful, think less useful? things
EMDR combined make useful? listeners podcast
come to, think, come podcast range backgrounds interests. me,
makes sense EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given newer
data can suppress amygdala activity animals animal models
humans well. really hasn't explored much, neurally. heard things like,


coordinates two sides brain, it, just throwaway. don't think
evidence that, coordinating two sides brain better not
coordinating. wouldn't speaking right now two sides brain, well
correlated. - Yeah. - language lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - heard
mimics, rapid eye movements sleep, actually doesn't. So, - Right. -
heard people talk positive experiences EMDR.
thoughts EMDR? - Yeah, good comment one recent
podcasts. tell you, one way sort think bemused point view,
old, mentioned earlier, oldest sort idea hypnotic induction,
dangling watch, right? [indistinct] watch. And, fact, enough concern
automobiles invented, movement prevent
installing windshield wipers people afraid hypnotized,
watched windshield wipers go back forth car. Now, turns
fortunately that, tend not look windshield wipers. keep looking

exactly used hypnotic induction. think lot hypnosis EMDR. - Ah. -
think, combination exposure based treatments, use
EMDR think it. tend not process experience much just
physical part it, personally think drawback. And, every study seen
dismantling study. no question people go EMDR, many

things. So, tend think that, EMDR another form exposure based therapy
trauma, implied exception possible new data, certainly
doesn't with, rapid eye movement sleep. don't think moving eyes
issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put
weight this, going re-injure ankle example, simply mean
body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat
something coming opportunity something ameliorate situation. So,
not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding
happening. face also say, opportunity
something it. minute realistically enha- doesn't mean,
imagine away heart attack. means figure rehabilitate heart attack

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body
floating, safe comfortable. Now, picture Mary sit feeling sadness
no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,
watch it, try [stutters]. work enjoying together shows
breathing patterns may increase sympathetic arousal may decrease. may

absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go

ourselves, greater ways modulating internal state. So, can either it,
thinking it, way pain control hypnosis can

feel exuding instrument. hypnotic like state too. many athletes
peak performance, just flowing it. not thinking step step,
doing? best working
giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much
always you. can people learn about, can get

access that. - Reveri app app store, way. reveri.com
website, can get download Reveri app app
store. - Great. So, currently apple, hopefully soon, also Android,
meantime, people interested exploring clinical hypnosis, working
somebody similar? centralized resource people can go find, really
well-trained hypnotists? - two good professional organizations will help
that. One society clinical experimental hypnosis. think
sceh.us their- - Okay, look provide link. - American society
clinical hypnosis, provide referral services professionals. can look
up. just say general, look someone licensed trained
primary professional discipline, psychiatry, psychology, medicine, dentistry
training interest using hypnosis, way it. - Great one
question comment. question is, will psychiatrist? - [laughs]
honored. - tall task. might stubborn patient. - think hardest
work's already done, Andrew. - Thank you. - fine, now. - appreciate that.
[David laughing] Well, final thing comment. First all, thank much
today, sharing knowledge. - welcome. - hope can
again. - hope so. - love working laboratory you. -
Likewise [indistinct]. - speak, learn know others well. -
Thank you. - will put resources get also just want say, thank


work do. - Well, thank you. - incredible thing world
discovering much body works, mind still rather
mysterious people struggling lot things, also think people
really excited about, applying tools like hypnosis perform better, feel better mentally
physically. pointed us tremendous amount resources
tools work already demonstrated work. just, thank
you. know professional commitment life benefit. So, thank
so. - Well, thank you, real joy collaborating
using precision knowledge neuroanatomy, neurobiology
address problems often people disciplined primary
neurobiological end, aren't interested are. so, really pleasure
try bring together know different perspectives build
something neither us alone. so, real joy it. -
Thank you, honored.

too. so, thought,

00:16:45 Stage Hypnosis

want understand better. want see can do. Stage hypnotists
drive nuts. make fools people. one. case father
involved. got call from, Columbia, got call, Spiegel, got
come see woman, ER. kind weird upset state
happened. turned show stage hypnotist who,
way is, cycle around, know, beginning show,
don't just grab somebody say, this. get bunch people up.
[indistinct] testing, see people- get ones
hypnotizable. one. said, now little bird
hand, going play bird. starts cry scream.
just gets off stage, 'cause upsetting. wandering around New
York City middle night dissociated brought Columbia.
father saw her. still kind uncomfortable trance like state.
turned out, trophy wife wealthy guy. felt like bird
gilded cage. her, image just triggered sense of, dissatisfaction
discomfort, fear life. able get reoriented talk
going life. don't like stage hypnosis.
making fools people using fact, scares people
hypnosis. think losing control. gaining control. Self-hypnosis
way enhancing control, mind body. can work well,
gives kind cognitive flexibility, able shift sets easily.
give judging evaluating way usually see something
different point view. great therapeutic opportunity, misused,
danger too, scares people it. ability suspend
critical judgment just experience see happens. can
great therapeutic opportunity, somebody's misusing it, can way harm
people. plenty examples people, fantasies imposed them,
come think realities. not unusual days. So, ability that,
people learn recognize understand it, can tremendous therapeutic tool. -
stage hypnotized clinically hypnotized many times self-


hypnosis app. talk later. know plans hypnotize
today. done before. - Mm-hm. - [Andrew] hypnotizable
know. - Right. - talk about, one can gauge hypnotizability. - Sure.
- stage hypnosis, interesting. college, brought someone
dormitory and, recall one people selected. - Mm-hm. -
engaging bizarre behavior, right? wasn't thoroughly embarrassing,
pretty embarrassing. sent off stage, exiting, suddenly
screaming something planted suggestion sort. - Ah, mm-
hm. - told look pocket was, like a, think, torn
dollar bill. bunch things vague recollection of.

00:20:25 Neurobiology Hypnosis

- Mm-hm. raises set questions really boil to, biologist, always
think that, no events brain, processes. hypnosis, know
induction. one hypnotized, imagine. sounds like woman
example bird distraught New York City, failure exit
hypnotic state. know sorts brain areas active induction,
call deep hypnosis shutting off changing people exit
hypnosis. - Yes, do, studied that. interested that. so,
study selected highly non-hypnotizable people
comparison. hypnotize functional MRI scanner. found
three things characterized entry hypnotic state. first turning
activity dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. DACC central front-middle
part brain well know. part call salience network.
conflict detector. engaged work hear loud noise think
might gunshot, anterior cingulate cortex saying, hey, wait minute,
potential danger there. better pay attention it. So, compares
else going helps decide do.
can imagine, turning activity region, make less likely
distracted pulled whatever in. another study, found
highly hypnotizable people, even without hypnotized, functional
connectivity DACC, anterior cingulate cortex left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex. So, part key region executive control network. So,


engaging tasks, enacting plan, writing paper,
whatever doing. prefrontal cortex that. so,
coordinated, found functional connectivity. So, one up, other's
one down, other's down. coordination implies brain saying,
okay, go ahead, know doing. Carry plan. don't worry
possibilities. So, two things happen people hypnotized. One
DLPFC higher functional connectivity insula. Another part
salience network. part mind-body control system, sensitive
happening body. part pain network well, also region
brain where, can control things body wouldn't think could.
example, study years ago, took people highly
hypnotizable, hypnotized told them, went imaginary culinary tour. So,
eat favorite foods found that, increased gastric acid
secretion, like 87%. So, stomach acting though get,
mean, one woman, vivid halfway through, said,
stop, full, [laughs] eating imaginary- - never eaten- - never
eaten anything- - Actual food? - No. - Incredible. - got relax
think anything food drink. got like 40% decrease gastric acid
secretions. DLPFC insula, telling stomach getting
food not getting food. even, injected Pentagastrin,
triggers gastric acid release. even hypnosis condition, 19%
reduction gastric acid. So, brain amazing ability control going
body ways don't think ability control. just one
example. So, DLPFC insula connection. third thing happens,
relates stage, inverse functional connectivity
DLPFC posterior cingulate cortex. posterior cingulate part
default mode network. back brain. area whose activity goes
example, meditators. meditation, supposed selfless.
supposed to, [indistinct] self illusion, supposed let dissolve
just experience things. that, posterior cingulate decreasing
activity, inverse connection is, something not thinking
means me. may not even remember much it. do, don't care much
it. so, part dissociation occur hypnosis. So,
put things outside conscious awareness, don't worry means.


also adds cognitive flexibility. thinking, well, people like don't usually
this. may inhibit from, enacting new form psychotherapy example,
never done before. decreased activity part
brain reflects means, likely cognitively flexible
willing give try. one therapeutic advantages hypnosis well. -
Fascinating, really, going embarrass little bit. [David laughing]
positive sense, laboratory really one pioneered brain imaging
hypnotic states. And, sounds like it, understanding, correct? - Yeah,
mean, people, who've done excellent research too. - Sure. Pierre
Rainville Montreal several people,

00:26:04 ADHD

one leading labs neuroimaging hypnosis. - ask about,
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. get lot questions this. think lot
people just struggle holding attention nowadays, interference
phones devices. course, lot of, clinically legitimate ADHD there,
way describe, - Sure. - dorsal anterior cingulate salience
network conflict detector of, focusing something splitting
attention? distractable I? Seems relate extent activity
anterior cingulate cortex. people ADHD, display disruptions elements
networks hypnosis ever used to, self-hypnosis, be,
distinguish stage hypnosis, clinical self-hypnosis used enhance
people's ability focus hold attention? built component
hypnotic state. - great question. sort two ways think it,
terms enhancing focus, yes. helpful teaching people just prepare
mind narrow focus something. really engaged
reading something, writing pa- mean, that, sometimes thinking,
oh God, another hour. times hour will go think,
hey, great, that, feels game-like you, just assembling
parts puzzle putting 'em together. fun, just get absorbed,
me, hypnotic like experience, trouble, struggling,
sometimes things like self-hypnosis can help. not expert ADHD.
impression right, people constantly distracted


rather rigid. part easily distractable. upset
get distracted rather rigid want attend
can. think, way controlling this, distractibility, frankly. guess many
people ADHD, not hypnotizable, haven't studied it. So,
possible people disorder,

00:28:22 Hypnosis Stress & Sleep

training self-hypnosis might help, see hypnotizable
take there. - want return underlying neural networks
clinical applications but, sorts things aside asthma, used
hypnosis successfully others used clinical hypnosis for?
particular areas of, psychiatric challenges illnesses, guess called,
particularly amenable hypnotic treatment. - Yes, are. Hypnosis good
problem focused treatment. oldest western conception psychotherapy,
can used specific problems way helpful. found helpful
stress reduction. helping people deal, dealing stress days.
helpful, mind-body connection helpful part problem
stress perception. mentioned earlier sort good sense,
football game something, feel physical reaction. can reinforcing
thing. Wow, exciting, it. can also distracting. So, worried
getting COVID worried about, physical problem have.
notice body, body tenses up, start sweat. sympathetic
nervous system goes, heart rate goes up. notice think, oh
God, really bad. feel worse. So, like snowball rolling downhill.
feel worse body gets worse. Hypnosis can helpful
dissociating somatic reaction psychological reactions. So, teach people
imagine body floating somewhere safe comfortable like bath, lake, hot tub
floating space, picture problem stressing imaginary
screen, rule, no matter see screen, keep body
comfortable. So, point, still can't control stress, can control
physical reaction it. starts feeling control. least one
thing can manage. can use think visualize one
thing might stressor. So, hypnosis helpful controlling mind-


body interaction relation stress. helpful people get sleep.
lot fun that. getting emails people said, haven't slept right
15 years, now first time, listening app can sleep night.
helpful again, wake middle night, tell people, don't
look clock. arousal cue. wake more, picture whatever
thinking worrying imaginary screen body
floating. So, watch movie, keep body floating. many people can
use get back sleep. - using self-hypnosis sleep long time.
now Reveri app, talk relationship Reveri app
uses. find incredibly useful falling back asleep middle night.
raises question, found think understand correctly, one can self-
hypnosis daytime. issue comes later, like,
instance, self-hypnosis stress reduction, away stressful event prepare
one deal stress better. - Right. - hypnosis improving return sleep.
can done actually want go sleep. kind training
networks,

00:32:12 Hypnosis Strengthen Neural Connections

right? - right. - So, evidence that, brain networks actually form
stronger connections, people self-hypnosis time? - Well, rule
neurobiology know, neurons fire together wire together. - friend,
Carla Shatz. - Yes, Carla- - Not Donald Hebb, way. [David laughing] keep trying
to, widespread myth world unfortunately, internet,
that, fire together wire together said by, psychologist, Donald Hebb
Donald Hebb many important things, neurobiologist Carla Shatz- -
exactly right. - Who, Yes, Stanford also Berkeley Harvard. So, also
decent schools. - exactly right. - Stanford, said, fire together wire
together. deserves, - Right. - credit statement. Yeah,
repeated use self-hypnosis, one imagine networks getting
stronger. - think so. don't evidence yet, long term
potentiation provides pathway described program, number
times allow repeated activation network actually build new connections
work. least, even learning memory point view, memory


network associations. remember things. example like
give is, go back grade school see little tiny lockers
size wrong. suddenly flood memories obviously stored
there, just didn't think of. So, context association memory's about.
start acquire memories problem. So, one thing use hypnosis
treating phobias, example. problem people phobias, like
airplane phobias crossing bridge high, avoid
more, source associations memories fear. don't
good experiences 'cause avoid it. like get back horse fall
off kind thing. hypnosis, can start people able manage anxiety
enough can more, wider array experiences, start
network associations isn't negative may even positive. - almost
like a, sorry interrupt, ask. - Sure - almost like a, exposure therapy
done mind. - Yes. - always mind. mean, even exposure to,
snake phobia, don't, don't like snakes, don't think qualifies full
blown phobia. think healthy fear snakes. - Yeah. - if, say
snake phobia, typical approach in, be, cognitive behavioral approaches, right,
show picture snake, rubber snake, real snake.
Eventually person is, - Yeah. - holding boa constrictor something like that. -
[David] Right. - mind translate nervous system
signals. hypnosis, sounds like can give number positive experiences
without use props, without bring animals room. - Right,
I- - Drive someone across bridge, right? - Yes, woman,
successful business woman, high level corporation. terrible dog phobia.
imagine somebody brought dog room said, "what
doing?" see getting tense. said, "Well, waiting
see dog does." said, "If somebody works you, comes
office, freeze wait see did?" said, "Of course not,
tell 'em do." [laughs] said, "Well, immobilizing yourself, power
isn't dog you, so, imagine might engage dog
help control situation." said, "Thanks." reminds of, one
favorite stories hypnosis that, father seeing woman lived
Midtown Manhattan horrible dog phobia. dropped things, spill
coffee saw dog. time trips store, thought


least likely people walking dogs. - Now wouldn't possible, everyone
in- - [laughs] Everyone New York dog - like fleet French Bulldogs, -
Right, exactly. - taking New York City. - So, taught think dog
friend, neighbor dog, bring dog hold dog collar
make sure, gradually able stroke dog say, dog friend
distinguish wild tame animals. animals, afraid
[murmurs]. So, seemed better. called back three months later
asked her. "Well, calling?" son said. said, "Dr. Spiegel."
boy said, "That's weird." father said, "What's weird?" said, "Spiegel's
heat." bought dog, - love it. - named it, Spiegel. - love it. - Talk
transference. - love it. [David laughing]

00:37:19 Restructuring Trauma Narratives

really speaks power this. brings back issue. So,
different about, father case woman, terms
happened hypnosis allowed go completely terrified dogs
owning dog naming father? find amusing. - Yeah. -
different just two sitting talking it, right? know,
therapy, narrative huge component. - Right. - hypnosis narrative huge
component. - Right. - must that, brain state really different.
talk trauma minutes. think people trauma
phobias, certainly conversation it. might freeze up.
might lose articulation forth. different
state combines narrative, think allow underlying neural networks
engage change? 'Cause find fascinating a- Every attempt
dealing stress phobia clinical setting involves discussion
is. - Yes. - But, not talking medication introduced,
least not particular circumstances. - Right. - So, realize kind obvious
question like, difference brain activity, find incredible.
control variable brain state. not, spoken. - raising
couple important issues, Andrew. talked earlier systematic
desensitization, sort lay hierarchy things one time.
think unsystematic desensitization, changing mental states.


think evidence mental state change
therapeutic potential. seeing ketamine treating depression,
dissociogenic drug. know every morning wake up, problem,
know, made mistake reading nasty email 11:00 PM. didn't know
do. wake morning thinking, oh, idiot, yeah,
going do. So, just changing mental state, therapeutic potential. think
underestimate ability regulate change responses cognitively,
emotionally somatically flexible. so, things, right, follow similar
principles facing problem, seeing different point view. done
really, nice podcast trauma stress expose it,
not avoid it, talked before. find way reconnect it,
substitute something can make feel good, rather bad, activate
centers brain like mesolimbic reward system. so, hypnosis
can much faster. People don't think can can.
having, right now physical experience, thinking not feeling
bad used to. can powerful thing can hypnosis. So,
woman came see me, suffered attempted rape. getting dark,
coming back grocery store guy grabs wants get
apartment. outside apartment. starts fighting
winds basilar skull fracture. runs away. cops come, since hadn't
raped, left, weren't interested. wanted use hypnosis get
better image guy looked like, painful, upsetting thing. So,
quite hypnotizable. got floating. say, safe comfortable, now, nothing
can happen will harm body. left side screen, want
picture guy approaching happening. said, really,
light, getting dark. really can't see much facial features, recognize
something, hadn't allowed remember. gets upstairs, doesn't just
want rape me, going kill me. so, ways, seeing
even worse. So, thinking, good, Spiegel, made even frightened
before. pointed PTSD stress lecture, got
confront trauma, restructure understanding it. So, side
screen, picture, protect yourself? everybody
trauma situation engages strategy self protection. salience network
kicking in. said, "You know what?" surprised fighting hard.


didn't think would. so, realized one hand even worse
thought was. hand actually probably saved life.
so, way of, helping restructure experience trauma make
tolerable. helped her- didn't recog- couldn't identify guy,
helped restructure understand experience. something
can just talking, straight psychotherapy. sometimes can hell
lot faster efficiently using hypnosis. one randomized trial
Israel shows adding hypnosis PTSD treatment, actually improves
outcome. way accomplishing things understand broader
psychotherapy world, much quickly sometimes effectively. - Yeah,
sounds like going somewhat state one trying deal with,
dissociating state key. imagine, open
various podcasts. done lot analysis years. experienced
sessions, depending show them, might just get kind
laundry list happened opposed actually feeling anything, around
happened. - Right. - think people probably vary extent can
drop feeling states can depend day. can depend well
slept night on. - one thing might add, Andrew, - Yes. -
is, notion late Gordon Bower, just memorial Gordon
Stanford. died year ago. Brilliant cognitive psychologist, one founders
cognitive psychology Stanford great pitcher. almost became Major
League pitcher decided go grad school instead, glad did.
Gordon helped establish concept state dependent memory
certain mental state, enhance ability remember things it. sort
bad example drunk hides bottle can't remember
put gets drunk mental state. People go
dissociative states traumatized. way, hypnosis helping
remember deal memories better mental state
like happened. rape victims will tell you, floating
body, feeling sorry woman assaulted below. People traumatic
episodes, just say, know, blank out, don't know happening,
autopilot kind self hypnotic state. So, use hypnosis help
deal traumatic memory, making state in, right office
you, congruent state likely in, trauma happened.


think part helps facilitate treatment trauma related disorders. -
see.

00:45:14 Ketamine Therapy

makes ask, every question ask, 'cause really feel
almost like compulsion, dissociation traumatic episode is, part
adaptive strategy. - Right. - creates certain issues, creates problems, right?
something like ketamine, creates dissociative state, useful
treatment trauma? confused days colleague,
Karl Deisseroth, also podcast coworkers figured out,
okay, layer one networks neocortex, involved
dissociative state. starting gain understanding ketamine
works neural level. - Right. - seem, certain populations can
useful treatment. don't know, never tried it. don't know current status
is, legal. allowed least in, FDA approved use.
dissociative states useful element dissociation gave rise
trauma memory first place? - Well, yeah, Karl brilliant paper
nature he, rats humans one paper. showed
rhythmic discharge retrosplenial region, triggered ketamine.
rats actually showed dissociative like behavior, hot pad
ordinarily wouldn't didn't seem much pain paw.
male subject implanted electrodes- - Human, yeah. - human subject, yeah.
electrodes picked rhythmic activity. did,
report dissociative state. description was, like pilot
airplane. felt walking cockpit plane still flying
and- - sounds terrifying me. [David laughing] sounds terrify terrifying. -
thing- - want body, [David laughing] time, know. -
right but, point is, way principal, Andrew, like, principle said,
need re-confront traumatic situation can modulate associations
it. So, accept it, accept arousal, put boundaries around
figure can approach problem approach
problem different point view. So, not surprise- fact, studied,
people disassociated Loma Prieta earthquake Oakland-Berkeley


firestorm. - remember well. - Yeah. - Earthquakes follow me. move
south Northridge quake- - going keep away So, there'll one
later, afternoon. [David laughing] - starting dissociating. So, dissociation
compartmentalize experience, means point view treating trauma,
inhibition. don't engage it. like happened there. think
happens people, sometimes good able separate
recollection. somewhere. sight not mind.
effects you, can't deal it. can't reprocess it. think
one reason ketamine might work fact, allows keep, re-approach
dissociative experience way can start think something
it. just fact can turn off. also self-hypnosis
helpful. not something just comes happens you.
something can make happen. can control it, can something it. So,
feel less helpless control. essence trauma helplessness. not
fear, not pain. helplessness. become object. become just body.
don't control going on. not used that. discussed
breathing paper anticipation breathing. not whether breathe, inhale
exhale hold breath, think can inhale can't,
really upsetting, understandably. so, issue control hypnosis,
terrible reputation taking away control actually superb way enhancing
control mind body. - love reminds naming important.
almost wonder self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis called something
else, would've separated stage hypnosis way make
less scary, weird, complicated people embrace. But, - Yeah. - part reason
discussion is, great experiences hypnosis, seen
data, talking lot clinical examples. incredibly powerful boils
right neural brain states. - Right. - And,

00:50:07 Self-directed Hypnosis, Reveri

think years come, going become widespread along lines.
quickly, described examples people getting relief quickly. -
Right. - permanent, changes? need follow related
that, sure number people listening thinking, wonderful, love


get hypnotized number different things Dr. Spiegel somebody else expert
clinical hypnosis, might not access somebody similar
training. power? So, quickly work? long lasting
changes? then, necessary work clinical hypnotist? better
self-hypnosis forth? Maybe just give us contour
landscape directed self-directed treatment. - Well, typically, people
start coming see clinician like me. better see someone licensing
training professional discipline, medicine, psychology, dentistry, whatever. -
'Cause lot hypnotists there, just hypnotist. - Right. Just
hypnotists. - Oh, okay. - key issue is, somebody can really assess
problem make sure not, talking someone reducing chest
pain, rather getting coronary artery problem- - 'Cause real
issue there. - could, right. - hypnosis might adjust wouldn't deal
deeper underlying issue. - right. hand. typically use
people, often see twice periodically, not every week.
certainly not every day, pain problem hypnosis helpful pain.
so, is, identifying hypnotizable are. give standard
brief test ability experience hypnosis, going self-hypnosis
exercise deal problem, seeing respond it,
teaching themselves. old days, used use
iPhone record part session. play back hypnosis
experience. Now developed app, "Reveri," can teach people step
through, dealing pain, stress, focus, insomnia help people eat better
stop smoking. elements take 15 minutes elements just
take one two minutes people can refresh reinforce. - Two minute hypnosis,
[indistinct] one minute. - Yes. - Yeah. - one two, one two minutes
now, finding two thirds people find even just one minute
refresher, helps feel better. reporting, feel better. So, nice thing is,
know right away, whether likely help not. found, done
studies, looking hypnosis pain relief acute medical procedures.
randomized trial published Lancet, three conditions, people getting
arterial cutdowns chemoembolized tumors liver visualize renal artery
stenosis. don't use general anesthesia this. uncomfortable people
anxious three conditions. One standard care, push


button get opioids, IV. - surgery? - surgery. second
is, that, plus friendly nurse, comforting them. So, controlled
pleasant attention support. third was, taught self-hypnosis
pain control. So, feeling, can change temperature, body
cool, tingling, numb, floating ice water feeling comfortable. go
somewhere else, leave body go desert island enjoy yourself.
found that, two half hour procedure, hour half,
hypnosis group reduced pain 80%, compared standard, - Wow. care
group, using half amount opioids, fewer complications procedure
took 17 minutes less time average get done. not patient
relaxed. treatment staff. weren't dealing someone
struggling uncomfortable. measured anxiety thing.
hypnosis group, worried dead. no anxiety hour
half, saying, fine, know, fine. standard care
group, 5 10 anxiety scores point. So, published Lancet,
big randomized trial. drug that, every hospital country
using now, no industry push it. So, part helped us decide
needed help people, Reveri teach
provide interactive support it. it, question, although is,
work long term? 'Cause can acutely doesn't necessarily carry on. So,
around randomized trial women metastatic breast cancer.
advancing disease. met support group week taught
self-hypnosis, stress anxiety pain control end. end
year, treatment group half pain control group did, same,
low amounts medication. So, lasts. say, felt pain
chest thought metastasis, just exercise. got warm bath
felt fine. So, works becomes skill people acquire, can
tell right away, whether likely help them, working clinician now using
app ways helping learn use skill. So, nice thing will
know quickly, whether likely help not. is, can learn
yourself. - great will, again, there'll link Reveri caption,
available Apple Android. think even though nominal cost there,
think that, mentioned, medications approaches dealing
problems quite expensive, potential side effects things. Not


aren't also useful. - I, get that, - Please. - just one
thing. worked hard app. iOS app Apple. decided
table moment, redoing Android app. So, available,
working Alexa platform. not moment will soon. So, just
don't want people disappointed looking Android,
agenda don't moment.

00:56:53 Eliminating Obsessive Thoughts, Superstitions

- Great, thanks clarification. hopefully, time both, get asked lot
obsessive thoughts intrusive thoughts. also get asked lot OCD.
evidence hypnosis self-hypnosis can used for, dealing obsessive
thoughts? - Sometimes, obsessional people, just turn not
hypnotizable for, yeah, not random. tend controlling
thought, busy evaluating rather experiencing, so- - know people
like that. [David laughing] sounds like adaptive mindset lot professions. -
right. - get trained that, - Yeah. - school, obsess
exam, obsess the, - Yeah. - social interactions. mean, part
becoming functional human being. yet, can take us different- -
sometimes overdo it. mean, tell one example extreme situations, that,
know, judging, evaluating, not letting experience, including
emotionally. know somebody, listens tapes airplanes go down. So,
get black box listen it. said me, know- -
profession recreational- - No, profession. - Okay. -
did. 'Cause trying accident prevention handle things.
said worry people panicking, right? guys know
got 30 seconds 45 seconds just going
checklist. said, don't panic enough. taught do.
reason, good reason it. sometimes overdo it. painful
listen 'cause know going happen. So, kind balance
hit. sometimes get emotional absorbed not
enough sort see possibilities. can problem.
hand, sometimes rigid controlled don't let emotions guide
need protect protect others. So, say


general people OCD are, less hypnotizable side spectrum,
less likely allow engage any, typical example checking
OCD example, don't remember, whether locked door turned off
gas oven keep going back keep checking. So,
evaluative component brain, kind overrides experiential one sometimes
people can get benefit, not group select
likely respond self hypnotic approaches. - superstitions similar? -
Superstitions, think more, people hypnotizable, keep
getting caught things like superstitions there, imagination supplants
reality. seen lot happening recently. think there,
possible helped learning sort see put context, see
different point view. - developed pretty vicious superstition,
college hard break, actually. always feel, talk clinicians,
reveal certain things pathology. - Please do. - so- - get
bill later. - Thank you, yes, part reason arranged this. [David laughing] No,
just kidding. yeah, did. habit knocking wood things noticed
started to, sneak knocking wood every 'cause didn't want
people think often. started realize that, becoming
little bit reflex. saw incredible video Bence Olveczky's lab
Harvard. studies motor patterns. rats press different
sequences levers turn dials order get pellet food. that,
start introduce behaviors nothing actual lever
pressing, like start scratching hind quarters things like that. hat,
heads, excuse me, don't wear hats flipping ears. just like
pitcher throwing baseball. this, - Oh, yeah. - start incorporate
motor behaviors unrelated outcome, mind somehow starts think
necessary outcome. incorporate it. So, decided
break simply forcing not week. - Mm-hm. just
seemed like ridiculous, - [Both] thing do. Yeah, well- - Knock wood. - call
response prevention works. is, set new context
brain, get outcome want, devoid extraneous behavior. - Yeah,
knew nuts, right. knew illogical. - Right.

01:01:50 ‘Hypnotizability’, Spiegel Eye-roll Test



- somehow things take meaning. - [David] Right. - So, talked about,
utility hypnosis stress reduction, phobias, pain, possibly, don't know for,
things like ADHD OCD, just will depend hypnotizability. - Right. - talked
beautiful study the, metastatic breast cancer outcome patients.
Hypnotizability clearly key variable. - Yes. - please tell us,
hypnotizability is, evaluated Spiegel Eye-Roll Test is? - Okay,
sure. So, hypnotizability just capacity hypnotic experiences.
test called hypnotic conduction profile. give highly structured hypnotic
experience. old tradition clinical hypnosis was, try bunch
different things, talking, walking upstairs downstairs images time
say breathing subject that. change
clinician, less can make variation outcome. take
long time, know, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. just view kind complex,
not effective way assessing person's hypnotic capacity. know
peak period hypnotizability human life, latency years childhood. So,

experience. people start lose hypnotic ability. time
early 20s, hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed. study done
Stanford, Ernest Hillard, Phil Zimbardo this, looking at, tracked
students psych one, hypnotizability measured retested
blindly 25 years later. test, retest correlation was, want guess
was? - guessing it's, don't know, 0.6 something. - Yeah, close. 0.7, IQ
0.6, 25 year interval. - Wow. - So, stable IQ 25
year interval. So, point, are. factors


lead that? Well, means that, third adults just
not hypnotizable. Two thirds are, 15% extremely hypnotizable can
measure give number 0 10. useful.
patients it, say, look, sorry, not hypnotizable going
something else. Medication, systematic desensitization, mindfulness, things
hypnotizable, just go it. don't lot explaining. People
low moderate hypnotizable, like explanations doing,
can still get benefits. So, helps guide nature treatment
people. Now, eye roll is, father used use eye fixation induction, used
say, look ceiling now close eyes looking up. very,
yes, very- - Yeah [indistinct] [laughs]. - noticed two patients back
back. one woman seen work with, hysterical seizures.
just suddenly start shaking. And- - Real epileptic seizures? - No, pseudo
epileptic seizures. - see, hysteria. - Hysteria, although people both,
the, people, real epilepsy becomes framework gets elaborated on,
stressed, seizures. just pseudo epilepsy, no EEG
abnormalities. really something watch. husband move
work bench near door, started seizure, run home
try help it. bad. noticed
did, looked up, one seizure events, see
sclera, don't see Iris anymore. start seize. great thing
her. taught seizures. Everybody else telling stop.
made one. hypnotized her, [indistinct] go back last time
one sure enough, start shake. gradually make smaller
smaller. So, learning control, access, like
PTSD, confront, don't avoid it, don't suppress it. confront figure
deal it. next patient rigid obsessional businessman
wanted stop controlling [chuckles], reminded me,
New Yorker cartoon driver, comes yield sign yells, "Never!"
always [indistinct]. - sounds right, New Yorker. - Yeah, New
Yorker. so, guy, tried look up, couldn't keep eyes
closed them. so, father started testing people. seemed
rough correlation capacity keep eyes up, closed
measured hypnotizability. - people listening [stutters], watching


video. So, Spiegel Eye-Roll Test, involves looking ceiling. So, tilting
head back, tilting chin back looking ceiling now. also
directing eyes upward eyes open. eye roll test involves
then, closing eyelids eyes open. - open. - whether not,
eyes roll back said it, see sclera, white part. - see sclera,
white part. - means you're, hypnotizable moderately hypnotizable. -
Right. - Whereas eyes move see iris, colored part eye
eyes close, less hypnotizable. - Right. - can look online there, just
put Spiegel Eye-Roll Test find it. also going actual
example hypnosis video later. - Right. So, asking brain something
difficult, keep eyes closing eyelids. contradictory signals
third, fourth sixth cranial nerve nuclei control eye movement. - said
third- - Fourth six, - Yup. - cranial nerve nuclei. suspending one
activity, asking another eye movements lot levels
consciousness. periaqueductal gray, surrounds cranial nerve nuclei.
close eyes sleep, rapid eye movement dream.
drugs, affect level consciousness, can affect eyes eye movements,
either dilation contraction pupils, depending whether stimulant
opioid. - Stimulants, make pupils big. - Big, right? - Yeah. Like cocaine,
amphetamine. - Right, exactly. - Things sort. - opioids, get constricted
pupils. - parents looking kids coming door late night,
looking substance abuse. - right. - Yeah. - So, something
eyes lot level consciousness. mean, obviously, close
eyes go sleep, rapid eye movement dreaming.
So, not surprising. old Zen practice called, looking third eye.
think part reason happens is, looking inside like
third eye two forehead. think
visual creatures, pretty pathetic physical point view. Many animals
can outrun us, outs smell us eagles read newsprint hundred yards
can't. So, major defensive sensory input vision. animals,
predator animals eyes front head, good,
detailed vision prey. Whereas prey animals like deer, eyes side

see threat. mainly use, fact, interesting, social


anthropologists say, gather do, coastlines edge

attack one side big vision might threaten you.
tend attracted kinds physical situations, so- - Yeah, love vistas. -
love vistas, right. - Vistas calming. take us panoramic

makes sense. - Sure. - But, signs locations built around, people's
tendency animals tendencies. - Oh, really [indistinct]? - aggregate there. Yeah,
interesting book history national parks says, didn't
give research study support it, no Google Maps, obviously. -
interesting. - Yeah, panorama visual boundaries really interesting. think,
eyes, know, two pieces central nervous system brain,

contradictory activity, looking controlled one set cranial nerves.
closing eyelids, controlled another cranial nerve. - No,
one. think six close eyes, activate, no, facial,
guess facial nerve. 7, yeah. - 7, yeah. - looking up, activating

those, relaxes upper movement, eyes closed don't

father. So, Spiegel senior Spiegel junior? - Spiegel senior. -
developed Spiegel Eye-Roll Test. - key issue this, normally
close eyes also, going sleep. not worried going
world anymore. Here, maintaining resting alertness. So, focusing
turning inward. unusual state. Normally close eyes periodically,
to, close eyes period time, normally go


sleep not worried detecting risk threat. So, interesting state
turning inward, basically, looking up, shutting eyes
allowing whatever happens outside happen focusing
going inward. So, think signal brain turn inward. - interesting.
meditation course, done eyes open almost always done
eyes closed. - Yes, right. - interesting. So, can quickly determine
whether not someone highly hypnotizable. - Right. - not hypnotizable.
said two thirds people can hypnotized. - Right. - Obviously third cannot.
within two thirds can, range, said 15% people fall
this, highly hypnotizable category. - Right, correct. - seem member
of. - Yeah. - And, repeated use self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis, increase
change hypnotizability, can access first place? - say
general, may increase little bit, not hell lot, not worth effort
increase hypnotizability point. worth trying deal problem,
dealing with. So, can get better using level have.
study done tried train people hypnotizable
obviously, there're subjective behavioral components test, can learn
little better them. found reanalyze data,
account three times final score, based initial hypnotizability
measurement, rather whether not trained better. So,
can improve little

01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)

not worth trouble. - Got it. Along lines eyes eye movements, lot
interest EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. -
Shapiro working, wasn't Stanford directly, local
Stanford. - Yeah. - think Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - thoughts
EMDR? useful, think less useful? things
EMDR combined make useful? listeners podcast
come to, think, come podcast range backgrounds interests. me,
makes sense EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given newer
data can suppress amygdala activity animals animal models
humans well. really hasn't explored much, neurally. heard things like,


coordinates two sides brain, it, just throwaway. don't think
evidence that, coordinating two sides brain better not
coordinating. wouldn't speaking right now two sides brain, well
correlated. - Yeah. - language lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - heard
mimics, rapid eye movements sleep, actually doesn't. So, - Right. -
heard people talk positive experiences EMDR.
thoughts EMDR? - Yeah, good comment one recent
podcasts. tell you, one way sort think bemused point view,
old, mentioned earlier, oldest sort idea hypnotic induction,
dangling watch, right? [indistinct] watch. And, fact, enough concern
automobiles invented, movement prevent
installing windshield wipers people afraid hypnotized,
watched windshield wipers go back forth car. Now, turns
fortunately that, tend not look windshield wipers. keep looking
windshield. so, windshield wipers today. movement is,
exactly used hypnotic induction. think lot hypnosis EMDR. - Ah. -
think, combination exposure based treatments, use
EMDR think it. tend not process experience much just
physical part it, personally think drawback. And, every study seen
dismantling study. no question people go EMDR, many

things. So, tend think that, EMDR another form exposure based therapy
trauma, implied exception possible new data, certainly
doesn't with, rapid eye movement sleep. don't think moving eyes
issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put
weight this, going re-injure ankle example, simply mean
body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat
something coming opportunity something ameliorate situation. So,
not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding
happening. face also say, opportunity
something it. minute realistically enha- doesn't mean,
imagine away heart attack. means figure rehabilitate heart attack


broken leg something like way get much control

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body
floating, safe comfortable. Now, picture Mary sit feeling sadness
no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,
watch it, try [stutters]. work enjoying together shows
breathing patterns may increase sympathetic arousal may decrease. may
[indistinct] cyclic sighing seems to, actually, time spent exhaling
inhaling. reason believe induces parasympathetic activity,
'cause increasing pressure chest therefore allowing heart slow
blood returned atrium easily. use it. ask people
take deep breath part induction slowly exhale. partly
result research together, emphasizing slow exhale more, part
[stutters], enhance idea induction period relaxation, 'cause
think inducing perhaps perceiving well. So, no,
absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go
automatically can control it. so, kind way us demonstrate
ourselves, greater ways modulating internal state. So, can either it,
thinking it, way pain control hypnosis can
extent, taking charge breathing things will produce change
want see happen body. So, like right margin,
can enhance, me, like way augmenting hypnosis,
medication, think powerful way that. - Great, really excited see
goes. - Yes. - Breathing, vision, bodily states clearly the-
directed mental focus, seem key elements hypnosis. missing


ingredients? - Yeah, think right. - It's- - Breathing, vision, - Breathing, vision,
change vision don't, know, typically physically relaxed
state, frankly people peak performance, including physical athletic
performance musical performance hypnotic states too. talked
classical pianists say, not thinking, start thinking fingers
now, screw up. floating piano, thinking tone want
feel exuding instrument. hypnotic like state too. many athletes
peak performance, just flowing it. not thinking step step,
doing? best working
giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much
always you. can people learn about, can get
hypnotized? mentioned Reveri, put link it, R-E-V-E-R-I.com way
access that. - Reveri app app store, way. reveri.com
website, can get download Reveri app app
store. - Great. So, currently apple, hopefully soon, also Android,
meantime, people interested exploring clinical hypnosis, working
somebody similar? centralized resource people can go find, really
well-trained hypnotists? - two good professional organizations will help
that. One society clinical experimental hypnosis. think
sceh.us their- - Okay, look provide link. - American society
clinical hypnosis, provide referral services professionals. can look
up. just say general, look someone licensed trained
primary professional discipline, psychiatry, psychology, medicine, dentistry
training interest using hypnosis, way it. - Great one
question comment. question is, will psychiatrist? - [laughs]
honored. - tall task. might stubborn patient. - think hardest
work's already done, Andrew. - Thank you. - fine, now. - appreciate that.
[David laughing] Well, final thing comment. First all, thank much
today, sharing knowledge. - welcome. - hope can
again. - hope so. - love working laboratory you. -
Likewise [indistinct]. - speak, learn know others well. -
Thank you. - will put resources get also just want say, thank


work do. - Well, thank you. - incredible thing world
discovering much body works, mind still rather
mysterious people struggling lot things, also think people
really excited about, applying tools like hypnosis perform better, feel better mentally
physically. pointed us tremendous amount resources
tools work already demonstrated work. just, thank
you. know professional commitment life benefit. So, thank
so. - Well, thank you, real joy collaborating
using precision knowledge neuroanatomy, neurobiology
address problems often people disciplined primary
neurobiological end, aren't interested are. so, really pleasure
try bring together know different perspectives build
something neither us alone. so, real joy it. -
Thank you, honored.

distracted pulled whatever in. another study, found
highly hypnotizable people, even without hypnotized, functional
connectivity DACC, anterior cingulate cortex left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex. So, part key region executive control network. So,


engaging tasks, enacting plan, writing paper,
whatever doing. prefrontal cortex that. so,
coordinated, found functional connectivity. So, one up, other's
one down, other's down. coordination implies brain saying,
okay, go ahead, know doing. Carry plan. don't worry
possibilities. So, two things happen people hypnotized. One
DLPFC higher functional connectivity insula. Another part
salience network. part mind-body control system, sensitive
happening body. part pain network well, also region
brain where, can control things body wouldn't think could.
example, study years ago, took people highly
hypnotizable, hypnotized told them, went imaginary culinary tour. So,
eat favorite foods found that, increased gastric acid
secretion, like 87%. So, stomach acting though get,
mean, one woman, vivid halfway through, said,
stop, full, [laughs] eating imaginary- - never eaten- - never
eaten anything- - Actual food? - No. - Incredible. - got relax
think anything food drink. got like 40% decrease gastric acid
secretions. DLPFC insula, telling stomach getting
food not getting food. even, injected Pentagastrin,
triggers gastric acid release. even hypnosis condition, 19%
reduction gastric acid. So, brain amazing ability control going
body ways don't think ability control. just one
example. So, DLPFC insula connection. third thing happens,
relates stage, inverse functional connectivity
DLPFC posterior cingulate cortex. posterior cingulate part
default mode network. back brain. area whose activity goes
example, meditators. meditation, supposed selfless.
supposed to, [indistinct] self illusion, supposed let dissolve
just experience things. that, posterior cingulate decreasing
activity, inverse connection is, something not thinking
means me. may not even remember much it. do, don't care much
it. so, part dissociation occur hypnosis. So,
put things outside conscious awareness, don't worry means.


also adds cognitive flexibility. thinking, well, people like don't usually
this. may inhibit from, enacting new form psychotherapy example,
never done before. decreased activity part
brain reflects means, likely cognitively flexible
willing give try. one therapeutic advantages hypnosis well. -
Fascinating, really, going embarrass little bit. [David laughing]
positive sense, laboratory really one pioneered brain imaging
hypnotic states. And, sounds like it, understanding, correct? - Yeah,
mean, people, who've done excellent research too. - Sure. Pierre
Rainville Montreal several people,

00:26:04 ADHD

one leading labs neuroimaging hypnosis. - ask about,
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. get lot questions this. think lot
people just struggle holding attention nowadays, interference
phones devices. course, lot of, clinically legitimate ADHD there,
way describe, - Sure. - dorsal anterior cingulate salience
network conflict detector of, focusing something splitting
attention? distractable I? Seems relate extent activity
anterior cingulate cortex. people ADHD, display disruptions elements
networks hypnosis ever used to, self-hypnosis, be,
distinguish stage hypnosis, clinical self-hypnosis used enhance
people's ability focus hold attention? built component
hypnotic state. - great question. sort two ways think it,
terms enhancing focus, yes. helpful teaching people just prepare
mind narrow focus something. really engaged
reading something, writing pa- mean, that, sometimes thinking,
oh God, another hour. times hour will go think,
hey, great, that, feels game-like you, just assembling
parts puzzle putting 'em together. fun, just get absorbed,
me, hypnotic like experience, trouble, struggling,
sometimes things like self-hypnosis can help. not expert ADHD.
impression right, people constantly distracted


rather rigid. part easily distractable. upset
get distracted rather rigid want attend
can. think, way controlling this, distractibility, frankly. guess many
people ADHD, not hypnotizable, haven't studied it. So,
possible people disorder,

00:28:22 Hypnosis Stress & Sleep

training self-hypnosis might help, see hypnotizable
take there. - want return underlying neural networks
clinical applications but, sorts things aside asthma, used
hypnosis successfully others used clinical hypnosis for?
particular areas of, psychiatric challenges illnesses, guess called,
particularly amenable hypnotic treatment. - Yes, are. Hypnosis good
problem focused treatment. oldest western conception psychotherapy,
can used specific problems way helpful. found helpful
stress reduction. helping people deal, dealing stress days.
helpful, mind-body connection helpful part problem
stress perception. mentioned earlier sort good sense,
football game something, feel physical reaction. can reinforcing
thing. Wow, exciting, it. can also distracting. So, worried
getting COVID worried about, physical problem have.
notice body, body tenses up, start sweat. sympathetic
nervous system goes, heart rate goes up. notice think, oh
God, really bad. feel worse. So, like snowball rolling downhill.
feel worse body gets worse. Hypnosis can helpful
dissociating somatic reaction psychological reactions. So, teach people
imagine body floating somewhere safe comfortable like bath, lake, hot tub
floating space, picture problem stressing imaginary
screen, rule, no matter see screen, keep body
comfortable. So, point, still can't control stress, can control
physical reaction it. starts feeling control. least one
thing can manage. can use think visualize one
thing might stressor. So, hypnosis helpful controlling mind-


body interaction relation stress. helpful people get sleep.
lot fun that. getting emails people said, haven't slept right
15 years, now first time, listening app can sleep night.
helpful again, wake middle night, tell people, don't
look clock. arousal cue. wake more, picture whatever
thinking worrying imaginary screen body
floating. So, watch movie, keep body floating. many people can
use get back sleep. - using self-hypnosis sleep long time.
now Reveri app, talk relationship Reveri app
uses. find incredibly useful falling back asleep middle night.
raises question, found think understand correctly, one can self-
hypnosis daytime. issue comes later, like,
instance, self-hypnosis stress reduction, away stressful event prepare
one deal stress better. - Right. - hypnosis improving return sleep.
can done actually want go sleep. kind training
networks,

00:32:12 Hypnosis Strengthen Neural Connections

right? - right. - So, evidence that, brain networks actually form
stronger connections, people self-hypnosis time? - Well, rule
neurobiology know, neurons fire together wire together. - friend,
Carla Shatz. - Yes, Carla- - Not Donald Hebb, way. [David laughing] keep trying
to, widespread myth world unfortunately, internet,
that, fire together wire together said by, psychologist, Donald Hebb
Donald Hebb many important things, neurobiologist Carla Shatz- -
exactly right. - Who, Yes, Stanford also Berkeley Harvard. So, also
decent schools. - exactly right. - Stanford, said, fire together wire
together. deserves, - Right. - credit statement. Yeah,
repeated use self-hypnosis, one imagine networks getting
stronger. - think so. don't evidence yet, long term
potentiation provides pathway described program, number
times allow repeated activation network actually build new connections
work. least, even learning memory point view, memory


network associations. remember things. example like
give is, go back grade school see little tiny lockers
size wrong. suddenly flood memories obviously stored
there, just didn't think of. So, context association memory's about.
start acquire memories problem. So, one thing use hypnosis
treating phobias, example. problem people phobias, like
airplane phobias crossing bridge high, avoid
more, source associations memories fear. don't
good experiences 'cause avoid it. like get back horse fall
off kind thing. hypnosis, can start people able manage anxiety
enough can more, wider array experiences, start
network associations isn't negative may even positive. - almost
like a, sorry interrupt, ask. - Sure - almost like a, exposure therapy
done mind. - Yes. - always mind. mean, even exposure to,
snake phobia, don't, don't like snakes, don't think qualifies full
blown phobia. think healthy fear snakes. - Yeah. - if, say
snake phobia, typical approach in, be, cognitive behavioral approaches, right,
show picture snake, rubber snake, real snake.
Eventually person is, - Yeah. - holding boa constrictor something like that. -
[David] Right. - mind translate nervous system
signals. hypnosis, sounds like can give number positive experiences
without use props, without bring animals room. - Right,
I- - Drive someone across bridge, right? - Yes, woman,
successful business woman, high level corporation. terrible dog phobia.
imagine somebody brought dog room said, "what
doing?" see getting tense. said, "Well, waiting
see dog does." said, "If somebody works you, comes
office, freeze wait see did?" said, "Of course not,
tell 'em do." [laughs] said, "Well, immobilizing yourself, power
isn't dog you, so, imagine might engage dog
help control situation." said, "Thanks." reminds of, one
favorite stories hypnosis that, father seeing woman lived
Midtown Manhattan horrible dog phobia. dropped things, spill
coffee saw dog. time trips store, thought


least likely people walking dogs. - Now wouldn't possible, everyone
in- - [laughs] Everyone New York dog - like fleet French Bulldogs, -
Right, exactly. - taking New York City. - So, taught think dog
friend, neighbor dog, bring dog hold dog collar
make sure, gradually able stroke dog say, dog friend
distinguish wild tame animals. animals, afraid
[murmurs]. So, seemed better. called back three months later
asked her. "Well, calling?" son said. said, "Dr. Spiegel."
boy said, "That's weird." father said, "What's weird?" said, "Spiegel's
heat." bought dog, - love it. - named it, Spiegel. - love it. - Talk
transference. - love it. [David laughing]

00:37:19 Restructuring Trauma Narratives

really speaks power this. brings back issue. So,
different about, father case woman, terms
happened hypnosis allowed go completely terrified dogs
owning dog naming father? find amusing. - Yeah. -
different just two sitting talking it, right? know,
therapy, narrative huge component. - Right. - hypnosis narrative huge
component. - Right. - must that, brain state really different.
talk trauma minutes. think people trauma
phobias, certainly conversation it. might freeze up.
might lose articulation forth. different
state combines narrative, think allow underlying neural networks
engage change? 'Cause find fascinating a- Every attempt
dealing stress phobia clinical setting involves discussion
is. - Yes. - But, not talking medication introduced,
least not particular circumstances. - Right. - So, realize kind obvious
question like, difference brain activity, find incredible.
control variable brain state. not, spoken. - raising
couple important issues, Andrew. talked earlier systematic
desensitization, sort lay hierarchy things one time.
think unsystematic desensitization, changing mental states.


think evidence mental state change
therapeutic potential. seeing ketamine treating depression,
dissociogenic drug. know every morning wake up, problem,
know, made mistake reading nasty email 11:00 PM. didn't know
do. wake morning thinking, oh, idiot, yeah,
going do. So, just changing mental state, therapeutic potential. think
underestimate ability regulate change responses cognitively,
emotionally somatically flexible. so, things, right, follow similar
principles facing problem, seeing different point view. done
really, nice podcast trauma stress expose it,
not avoid it, talked before. find way reconnect it,
substitute something can make feel good, rather bad, activate
centers brain like mesolimbic reward system. so, hypnosis
can much faster. People don't think can can.
having, right now physical experience, thinking not feeling
bad used to. can powerful thing can hypnosis. So,
woman came see me, suffered attempted rape. getting dark,
coming back grocery store guy grabs wants get
apartment. outside apartment. starts fighting
winds basilar skull fracture. runs away. cops come, since hadn't
raped, left, weren't interested. wanted use hypnosis get
better image guy looked like, painful, upsetting thing. So,
quite hypnotizable. got floating. say, safe comfortable, now, nothing
can happen will harm body. left side screen, want
picture guy approaching happening. said, really,
light, getting dark. really can't see much facial features, recognize
something, hadn't allowed remember. gets upstairs, doesn't just
want rape me, going kill me. so, ways, seeing
even worse. So, thinking, good, Spiegel, made even frightened
before. pointed PTSD stress lecture, got
confront trauma, restructure understanding it. So, side
screen, picture, protect yourself? everybody
trauma situation engages strategy self protection. salience network
kicking in. said, "You know what?" surprised fighting hard.


didn't think would. so, realized one hand even worse
thought was. hand actually probably saved life.
so, way of, helping restructure experience trauma make
tolerable. helped her- didn't recog- couldn't identify guy,
helped restructure understand experience. something
can just talking, straight psychotherapy. sometimes can hell
lot faster efficiently using hypnosis. one randomized trial
Israel shows adding hypnosis PTSD treatment, actually improves
outcome. way accomplishing things understand broader
psychotherapy world, much quickly sometimes effectively. - Yeah,
sounds like going somewhat state one trying deal with,
dissociating state key. imagine, open
various podcasts. done lot analysis years. experienced
sessions, depending show them, might just get kind
laundry list happened opposed actually feeling anything, around
happened. - Right. - think people probably vary extent can
drop feeling states can depend day. can depend well
slept night on. - one thing might add, Andrew, - Yes. -
is, notion late Gordon Bower, just memorial Gordon
Stanford. died year ago. Brilliant cognitive psychologist, one founders
cognitive psychology Stanford great pitcher. almost became Major
League pitcher decided go grad school instead, glad did.
Gordon helped establish concept state dependent memory
certain mental state, enhance ability remember things it. sort
bad example drunk hides bottle can't remember
put gets drunk mental state. People go
dissociative states traumatized. way, hypnosis helping
remember deal memories better mental state
like happened. rape victims will tell you, floating
body, feeling sorry woman assaulted below. People traumatic
episodes, just say, know, blank out, don't know happening,
autopilot kind self hypnotic state. So, use hypnosis help
deal traumatic memory, making state in, right office
you, congruent state likely in, trauma happened.


think part helps facilitate treatment trauma related disorders. -
see.

00:45:14 Ketamine Therapy

makes ask, every question ask, 'cause really feel
almost like compulsion, dissociation traumatic episode is, part
adaptive strategy. - Right. - creates certain issues, creates problems, right?
something like ketamine, creates dissociative state, useful
treatment trauma? confused days colleague,
Karl Deisseroth, also podcast coworkers figured out,
okay, layer one networks neocortex, involved
dissociative state. starting gain understanding ketamine
works neural level. - Right. - seem, certain populations can
useful treatment. don't know, never tried it. don't know current status
is, legal. allowed least in, FDA approved use.
dissociative states useful element dissociation gave rise
trauma memory first place? - Well, yeah, Karl brilliant paper
nature he, rats humans one paper. showed
rhythmic discharge retrosplenial region, triggered ketamine.
rats actually showed dissociative like behavior, hot pad
ordinarily wouldn't didn't seem much pain paw.
male subject implanted electrodes- - Human, yeah. - human subject, yeah.
electrodes picked rhythmic activity. did,
report dissociative state. description was, like pilot
airplane. felt walking cockpit plane still flying
and- - sounds terrifying me. [David laughing] sounds terrify terrifying. -
thing- - want body, [David laughing] time, know. -
right but, point is, way principal, Andrew, like, principle said,
need re-confront traumatic situation can modulate associations
it. So, accept it, accept arousal, put boundaries around
figure can approach problem approach
problem different point view. So, not surprise- fact, studied,
people disassociated Loma Prieta earthquake Oakland-Berkeley


firestorm. - remember well. - Yeah. - Earthquakes follow me. move
south Northridge quake- - going keep away So, there'll one
later, afternoon. [David laughing] - starting dissociating. So, dissociation
compartmentalize experience, means point view treating trauma,
inhibition. don't engage it. like happened there. think
happens people, sometimes good able separate
recollection. somewhere. sight not mind.
effects you, can't deal it. can't reprocess it. think
one reason ketamine might work fact, allows keep, re-approach
dissociative experience way can start think something
it. just fact can turn off. also self-hypnosis
helpful. not something just comes happens you.
something can make happen. can control it, can something it. So,
feel less helpless control. essence trauma helplessness. not
fear, not pain. helplessness. become object. become just body.
don't control going on. not used that. discussed
breathing paper anticipation breathing. not whether breathe, inhale
exhale hold breath, think can inhale can't,
really upsetting, understandably. so, issue control hypnosis,
terrible reputation taking away control actually superb way enhancing
control mind body. - love reminds naming important.
almost wonder self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis called something
else, would've separated stage hypnosis way make
less scary, weird, complicated people embrace. But, - Yeah. - part reason
discussion is, great experiences hypnosis, seen
data, talking lot clinical examples. incredibly powerful boils
right neural brain states. - Right. - And,

00:50:07 Self-directed Hypnosis, Reveri

think years come, going become widespread along lines.
quickly, described examples people getting relief quickly. -
Right. - permanent, changes? need follow related
that, sure number people listening thinking, wonderful, love


get hypnotized number different things Dr. Spiegel somebody else expert
clinical hypnosis, might not access somebody similar
training. power? So, quickly work? long lasting
changes? then, necessary work clinical hypnotist? better
self-hypnosis forth? Maybe just give us contour
landscape directed self-directed treatment. - Well, typically, people
start coming see clinician like me. better see someone licensing
training professional discipline, medicine, psychology, dentistry, whatever. -
'Cause lot hypnotists there, just hypnotist. - Right. Just
hypnotists. - Oh, okay. - key issue is, somebody can really assess
problem make sure not, talking someone reducing chest
pain, rather getting coronary artery problem- - 'Cause real
issue there. - could, right. - hypnosis might adjust wouldn't deal
deeper underlying issue. - right. hand. typically use
people, often see twice periodically, not every week.
certainly not every day, pain problem hypnosis helpful pain.
so, is, identifying hypnotizable are. give standard
brief test ability experience hypnosis, going self-hypnosis
exercise deal problem, seeing respond it,
teaching themselves. old days, used use
iPhone record part session. play back hypnosis
experience. Now developed app, "Reveri," can teach people step
through, dealing pain, stress, focus, insomnia help people eat better
stop smoking. elements take 15 minutes elements just
take one two minutes people can refresh reinforce. - Two minute hypnosis,
[indistinct] one minute. - Yes. - Yeah. - one two, one two minutes
now, finding two thirds people find even just one minute
refresher, helps feel better. reporting, feel better. So, nice thing is,
know right away, whether likely help not. found, done
studies, looking hypnosis pain relief acute medical procedures.
randomized trial published Lancet, three conditions, people getting
arterial cutdowns chemoembolized tumors liver visualize renal artery
stenosis. don't use general anesthesia this. uncomfortable people
anxious three conditions. One standard care, push


button get opioids, IV. - surgery? - surgery. second
is, that, plus friendly nurse, comforting them. So, controlled
pleasant attention support. third was, taught self-hypnosis
pain control. So, feeling, can change temperature, body
cool, tingling, numb, floating ice water feeling comfortable. go
somewhere else, leave body go desert island enjoy yourself.
found that, two half hour procedure, hour half,
hypnosis group reduced pain 80%, compared standard, - Wow. care
group, using half amount opioids, fewer complications procedure
took 17 minutes less time average get done. not patient
relaxed. treatment staff. weren't dealing someone
struggling uncomfortable. measured anxiety thing.
hypnosis group, worried dead. no anxiety hour
half, saying, fine, know, fine. standard care
group, 5 10 anxiety scores point. So, published Lancet,
big randomized trial. drug that, every hospital country
using now, no industry push it. So, part helped us decide
needed help people, Reveri teach
provide interactive support it. it, question, although is,
work long term? 'Cause can acutely doesn't necessarily carry on. So,
around randomized trial women metastatic breast cancer.
advancing disease. met support group week taught
self-hypnosis, stress anxiety pain control end. end
year, treatment group half pain control group did, same,
low amounts medication. So, lasts. say, felt pain
chest thought metastasis, just exercise. got warm bath
felt fine. So, works becomes skill people acquire, can
tell right away, whether likely help them, working clinician now using
app ways helping learn use skill. So, nice thing will
know quickly, whether likely help not. is, can learn
yourself. - great will, again, there'll link Reveri caption,
available Apple Android. think even though nominal cost there,
think that, mentioned, medications approaches dealing
problems quite expensive, potential side effects things. Not


aren't also useful. - I, get that, - Please. - just one
thing. worked hard app. iOS app Apple. decided
table moment, redoing Android app. So, available,
working Alexa platform. not moment will soon. So, just
don't want people disappointed looking Android,
agenda don't moment.

00:56:53 Eliminating Obsessive Thoughts, Superstitions

- Great, thanks clarification. hopefully, time both, get asked lot
obsessive thoughts intrusive thoughts. also get asked lot OCD.
evidence hypnosis self-hypnosis can used for, dealing obsessive
thoughts? - Sometimes, obsessional people, just turn not
hypnotizable for, yeah, not random. tend controlling
thought, busy evaluating rather experiencing, so- - know people
like that. [David laughing] sounds like adaptive mindset lot professions. -
right. - get trained that, - Yeah. - school, obsess
exam, obsess the, - Yeah. - social interactions. mean, part
becoming functional human being. yet, can take us different- -
sometimes overdo it. mean, tell one example extreme situations, that,
know, judging, evaluating, not letting experience, including
emotionally. know somebody, listens tapes airplanes go down. So,
get black box listen it. said me, know- -
profession recreational- - No, profession. - Okay. -
did. 'Cause trying accident prevention handle things.
said worry people panicking, right? guys know
got 30 seconds 45 seconds just going
checklist. said, don't panic enough. taught do.
reason, good reason it. sometimes overdo it. painful
listen 'cause know going happen. So, kind balance
hit. sometimes get emotional absorbed not
enough sort see possibilities. can problem.
hand, sometimes rigid controlled don't let emotions guide
need protect protect others. So, say


general people OCD are, less hypnotizable side spectrum,
less likely allow engage any, typical example checking
OCD example, don't remember, whether locked door turned off
gas oven keep going back keep checking. So,
evaluative component brain, kind overrides experiential one sometimes
people can get benefit, not group select
likely respond self hypnotic approaches. - superstitions similar? -
Superstitions, think more, people hypnotizable, keep
getting caught things like superstitions there, imagination supplants
reality. seen lot happening recently. think there,
possible helped learning sort see put context, see
different point view. - developed pretty vicious superstition,
college hard break, actually. always feel, talk clinicians,
reveal certain things pathology. - Please do. - so- - get
bill later. - Thank you, yes, part reason arranged this. [David laughing] No,
just kidding. yeah, did. habit knocking wood things noticed
started to, sneak knocking wood every 'cause didn't want
people think often. started realize that, becoming
little bit reflex. saw incredible video Bence Olveczky's lab
Harvard. studies motor patterns. rats press different
sequences levers turn dials order get pellet food. that,
start introduce behaviors nothing actual lever
pressing, like start scratching hind quarters things like that. hat,
heads, excuse me, don't wear hats flipping ears. just like
pitcher throwing baseball. this, - Oh, yeah. - start incorporate
motor behaviors unrelated outcome, mind somehow starts think
necessary outcome. incorporate it. So, decided
break simply forcing not week. - Mm-hm. just
seemed like ridiculous, - [Both] thing do. Yeah, well- - Knock wood. - call
response prevention works. is, set new context
brain, get outcome want, devoid extraneous behavior. - Yeah,
knew nuts, right. knew illogical. - Right.

01:01:50 ‘Hypnotizability’, Spiegel Eye-roll Test



- somehow things take meaning. - [David] Right. - So, talked about,
utility hypnosis stress reduction, phobias, pain, possibly, don't know for,
things like ADHD OCD, just will depend hypnotizability. - Right. - talked
beautiful study the, metastatic breast cancer outcome patients.
Hypnotizability clearly key variable. - Yes. - please tell us,
hypnotizability is, evaluated Spiegel Eye-Roll Test is? - Okay,
sure. So, hypnotizability just capacity hypnotic experiences.
test called hypnotic conduction profile. give highly structured hypnotic
experience. old tradition clinical hypnosis was, try bunch
different things, talking, walking upstairs downstairs images time
say breathing subject that. change
clinician, less can make variation outcome. take
long time, know, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. just view kind complex,
not effective way assessing person's hypnotic capacity. know
peak period hypnotizability human life, latency years childhood. So,
every eight year old trance time. call 'em dinner, don't
hear ya, thing. childhood wonderful
experience. Work play thing. try make little
adults, think terrible mistake. Everything fun them. enjoy learning,
enjoy everything. - age this- - like 6 10, 6 11.
playful, enjoy everything. Everything sort game fun try
make miserable them, got it. when, Piaget called,
adult cognitive framework, learn abstract concepts, learn even one
bottle looks bigger other, can equal volume. so, imposing
logic, growing DLPFC point imposing cognitive structure
experience. people start lose hypnotic ability. time
early 20s, hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed. study done
Stanford, Ernest Hillard, Phil Zimbardo this, looking at, tracked
students psych one, hypnotizability measured retested
blindly 25 years later. test, retest correlation was, want guess
was? - guessing it's, don't know, 0.6 something. - Yeah, close. 0.7, IQ
0.6, 25 year interval. - Wow. - So, stable IQ 25
year interval. So, point, are. factors


lead that? Well, means that, third adults just
not hypnotizable. Two thirds are, 15% extremely hypnotizable can
measure give number 0 10. useful.
patients it, say, look, sorry, not hypnotizable going
something else. Medication, systematic desensitization, mindfulness, things
hypnotizable, just go it. don't lot explaining. People
low moderate hypnotizable, like explanations doing,
can still get benefits. So, helps guide nature treatment
people. Now, eye roll is, father used use eye fixation induction, used
say, look ceiling now close eyes looking up. very,
yes, very- - Yeah [indistinct] [laughs]. - noticed two patients back
back. one woman seen work with, hysterical seizures.
just suddenly start shaking. And- - Real epileptic seizures? - No, pseudo
epileptic seizures. - see, hysteria. - Hysteria, although people both,
the, people, real epilepsy becomes framework gets elaborated on,
stressed, seizures. just pseudo epilepsy, no EEG
abnormalities. really something watch. husband move
work bench near door, started seizure, run home
try help it. bad. noticed
did, looked up, one seizure events, see
sclera, don't see Iris anymore. start seize. great thing
her. taught seizures. Everybody else telling stop.
made one. hypnotized her, [indistinct] go back last time
one sure enough, start shake. gradually make smaller
smaller. So, learning control, access, like
PTSD, confront, don't avoid it, don't suppress it. confront figure
deal it. next patient rigid obsessional businessman
wanted stop controlling [chuckles], reminded me,
New Yorker cartoon driver, comes yield sign yells, "Never!"
always [indistinct]. - sounds right, New Yorker. - Yeah, New
Yorker. so, guy, tried look up, couldn't keep eyes
closed them. so, father started testing people. seemed
rough correlation capacity keep eyes up, closed
measured hypnotizability. - people listening [stutters], watching


video. So, Spiegel Eye-Roll Test, involves looking ceiling. So, tilting
head back, tilting chin back looking ceiling now. also
directing eyes upward eyes open. eye roll test involves
then, closing eyelids eyes open. - open. - whether not,
eyes roll back said it, see sclera, white part. - see sclera,
white part. - means you're, hypnotizable moderately hypnotizable. -
Right. - Whereas eyes move see iris, colored part eye
eyes close, less hypnotizable. - Right. - can look online there, just
put Spiegel Eye-Roll Test find it. also going actual
example hypnosis video later. - Right. So, asking brain something
difficult, keep eyes closing eyelids. contradictory signals
third, fourth sixth cranial nerve nuclei control eye movement. - said
third- - Fourth six, - Yup. - cranial nerve nuclei. suspending one
activity, asking another eye movements lot levels
consciousness. periaqueductal gray, surrounds cranial nerve nuclei.
close eyes sleep, rapid eye movement dream.
drugs, affect level consciousness, can affect eyes eye movements,
either dilation contraction pupils, depending whether stimulant
opioid. - Stimulants, make pupils big. - Big, right? - Yeah. Like cocaine,
amphetamine. - Right, exactly. - Things sort. - opioids, get constricted
pupils. - parents looking kids coming door late night,
looking substance abuse. - right. - Yeah. - So, something
eyes lot level consciousness. mean, obviously, close
eyes go sleep, rapid eye movement dreaming.
So, not surprising. old Zen practice called, looking third eye.
think part reason happens is, looking inside like
third eye two forehead. think
visual creatures, pretty pathetic physical point view. Many animals
can outrun us, outs smell us eagles read newsprint hundred yards
can't. So, major defensive sensory input vision. animals,
predator animals eyes front head, good,
detailed vision prey. Whereas prey animals like deer, eyes side
head. So, don't see things well, much bigger range potential
see threat. mainly use, fact, interesting, social


anthropologists say, gather do, coastlines edge
forest something, got protection back. Something can
attack one side big vision might threaten you.
tend attracted kinds physical situations, so- - Yeah, love vistas. -
love vistas, right. - Vistas calming. take us panoramic
vision. - right. - didn't know this, turns scenic spots
location national parks people naturally aggregated was-
makes sense. - Sure. - But, signs locations built around, people's
tendency animals tendencies. - Oh, really [indistinct]? - aggregate there. Yeah,
interesting book history national parks says, didn't
give research study support it, no Google Maps, obviously. -
interesting. - Yeah, panorama visual boundaries really interesting. think,
eyes, know, two pieces central nervous system brain,
outside the- - Right. used say eyes outside skull neuro-
ophthalmologist wrote vehemently pointed outside
cranial vault, so, know. outside cranial vault two pieces
brain there. so, mentioned cranial nerves, three, four six.
isn't neuroanatomy course maybe go little deeper there. So, said
contradictory activity, looking controlled one set cranial nerves.
closing eyelids, controlled another cranial nerve. - No,
one. think six close eyes, activate, no, facial,
guess facial nerve. 7, yeah. - 7, yeah. - looking up, activating

Right. - hey, can't even it, see like the, - Right. [Andrew David laughing] -
exactly right. - Rubbing tummy patting head. bit

father. So, Spiegel senior Spiegel junior? - Spiegel senior. -
developed Spiegel Eye-Roll Test. - key issue this, normally
close eyes also, going sleep. not worried going
world anymore. Here, maintaining resting alertness. So, focusing
turning inward. unusual state. Normally close eyes periodically,
to, close eyes period time, normally go


sleep not worried detecting risk threat. So, interesting state
turning inward, basically, looking up, shutting eyes
allowing whatever happens outside happen focusing
going inward. So, think signal brain turn inward. - interesting.
meditation course, done eyes open almost always done
eyes closed. - Yes, right. - interesting. So, can quickly determine
whether not someone highly hypnotizable. - Right. - not hypnotizable.
said two thirds people can hypnotized. - Right. - Obviously third cannot.
within two thirds can, range, said 15% people fall
this, highly hypnotizable category. - Right, correct. - seem member
of. - Yeah. - And, repeated use self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis, increase
change hypnotizability, can access first place? - say
general, may increase little bit, not hell lot, not worth effort
increase hypnotizability point. worth trying deal problem,
dealing with. So, can get better using level have.
study done tried train people hypnotizable
obviously, there're subjective behavioral components test, can learn
little better them. found reanalyze data,
account three times final score, based initial hypnotizability
measurement, rather whether not trained better. So,
can improve little

01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)

not worth trouble. - Got it. Along lines eyes eye movements, lot
interest EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. -
Shapiro working, wasn't Stanford directly, local
Stanford. - Yeah. - think Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - thoughts
EMDR? useful, think less useful? things
EMDR combined make useful? listeners podcast
come to, think, come podcast range backgrounds interests. me,
makes sense EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given newer
data can suppress amygdala activity animals animal models
humans well. really hasn't explored much, neurally. heard things like,


coordinates two sides brain, it, just throwaway. don't think
evidence that, coordinating two sides brain better not
coordinating. wouldn't speaking right now two sides brain, well
correlated. - Yeah. - language lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - heard
mimics, rapid eye movements sleep, actually doesn't. So, - Right. -
heard people talk positive experiences EMDR.
thoughts EMDR? - Yeah, good comment one recent
podcasts. tell you, one way sort think bemused point view,
old, mentioned earlier, oldest sort idea hypnotic induction,
dangling watch, right? [indistinct] watch. And, fact, enough concern
automobiles invented, movement prevent
installing windshield wipers people afraid hypnotized,
watched windshield wipers go back forth car. Now, turns
fortunately that, tend not look windshield wipers. keep looking
windshield. so, windshield wipers today. movement is,
exactly used hypnotic induction. think lot hypnosis EMDR. - Ah. -
think, combination exposure based treatments, use
EMDR think it. tend not process experience much just
physical part it, personally think drawback. And, every study seen
dismantling study. no question people go EMDR, many
get better trauma related problems VA big program using
on. every program dismantled, going treatment
lateral eye movement, shown lateral eye movement, doesn't add
anything it. toward end career, Francine [indistinct]

things. So, tend think that, EMDR another form exposure based therapy
trauma, implied exception possible new data, certainly
doesn't with, rapid eye movement sleep. don't think moving eyes
issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put
weight this, going re-injure ankle example, simply mean
body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat
something coming opportunity something ameliorate situation. So,
not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding
happening. face also say, opportunity
something it. minute realistically enha- doesn't mean,
imagine away heart attack. means figure rehabilitate heart attack


broken leg something like way get much control

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body
floating, safe comfortable. Now, picture Mary sit feeling sadness
no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,
watch it, try [stutters]. work enjoying together shows
breathing patterns may increase sympathetic arousal may decrease. may
[indistinct] cyclic sighing seems to, actually, time spent exhaling
inhaling. reason believe induces parasympathetic activity,
'cause increasing pressure chest therefore allowing heart slow
blood returned atrium easily. use it. ask people
take deep breath part induction slowly exhale. partly
result research together, emphasizing slow exhale more, part
[stutters], enhance idea induction period relaxation, 'cause
think inducing perhaps perceiving well. So, no,
absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go
automatically can control it. so, kind way us demonstrate
ourselves, greater ways modulating internal state. So, can either it,
thinking it, way pain control hypnosis can
extent, taking charge breathing things will produce change
want see happen body. So, like right margin,
can enhance, me, like way augmenting hypnosis,
medication, think powerful way that. - Great, really excited see
goes. - Yes. - Breathing, vision, bodily states clearly the-
directed mental focus, seem key elements hypnosis. missing


ingredients? - Yeah, think right. - It's- - Breathing, vision, - Breathing, vision,
change vision don't, know, typically physically relaxed
state, frankly people peak performance, including physical athletic
performance musical performance hypnotic states too. talked
classical pianists say, not thinking, start thinking fingers
now, screw up. floating piano, thinking tone want
feel exuding instrument. hypnotic like state too. many athletes
peak performance, just flowing it. not thinking step step,
doing? best working
giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much
always you. can people learn about, can get
hypnotized? mentioned Reveri, put link it, R-E-V-E-R-I.com way
access that. - Reveri app app store, way. reveri.com
website, can get download Reveri app app
store. - Great. So, currently apple, hopefully soon, also Android,
meantime, people interested exploring clinical hypnosis, working
somebody similar? centralized resource people can go find, really
well-trained hypnotists? - two good professional organizations will help
that. One society clinical experimental hypnosis. think
sceh.us their- - Okay, look provide link. - American society
clinical hypnosis, provide referral services professionals. can look
up. just say general, look someone licensed trained
primary professional discipline, psychiatry, psychology, medicine, dentistry
training interest using hypnosis, way it. - Great one
question comment. question is, will psychiatrist? - [laughs]
honored. - tall task. might stubborn patient. - think hardest
work's already done, Andrew. - Thank you. - fine, now. - appreciate that.
[David laughing] Well, final thing comment. First all, thank much
today, sharing knowledge. - welcome. - hope can
again. - hope so. - love working laboratory you. -
Likewise [indistinct]. - speak, learn know others well. -
Thank you. - will put resources get also just want say, thank


work do. - Well, thank you. - incredible thing world
discovering much body works, mind still rather
mysterious people struggling lot things, also think people
really excited about, applying tools like hypnosis perform better, feel better mentally
physically. pointed us tremendous amount resources
tools work already demonstrated work. just, thank
you. know professional commitment life benefit. So, thank
so. - Well, thank you, real joy collaborating
using precision knowledge neuroanatomy, neurobiology
address problems often people disciplined primary
neurobiological end, aren't interested are. so, really pleasure
try bring together know different perspectives build
something neither us alone. so, real joy it. -
Thank you, honored.

engaging tasks, enacting plan, writing paper,
whatever doing. prefrontal cortex that. so,
coordinated, found functional connectivity. So, one up, other's
one down, other's down. coordination implies brain saying,
okay, go ahead, know doing. Carry plan. don't worry
possibilities. So, two things happen people hypnotized. One
DLPFC higher functional connectivity insula. Another part
salience network. part mind-body control system, sensitive
happening body. part pain network well, also region
brain where, can control things body wouldn't think could.
example, study years ago, took people highly
hypnotizable, hypnotized told them, went imaginary culinary tour. So,
eat favorite foods found that, increased gastric acid
secretion, like 87%. So, stomach acting though get,
mean, one woman, vivid halfway through, said,
stop, full, [laughs] eating imaginary- - never eaten- - never
eaten anything- - Actual food? - No. - Incredible. - got relax
think anything food drink. got like 40% decrease gastric acid
secretions. DLPFC insula, telling stomach getting
food not getting food. even, injected Pentagastrin,
triggers gastric acid release. even hypnosis condition, 19%
reduction gastric acid. So, brain amazing ability control going
body ways don't think ability control. just one
example. So, DLPFC insula connection. third thing happens,
relates stage, inverse functional connectivity
DLPFC posterior cingulate cortex. posterior cingulate part
default mode network. back brain. area whose activity goes
example, meditators. meditation, supposed selfless.
supposed to, [indistinct] self illusion, supposed let dissolve
just experience things. that, posterior cingulate decreasing
activity, inverse connection is, something not thinking
means me. may not even remember much it. do, don't care much
it. so, part dissociation occur hypnosis. So,
put things outside conscious awareness, don't worry means.


also adds cognitive flexibility. thinking, well, people like don't usually
this. may inhibit from, enacting new form psychotherapy example,
never done before. decreased activity part
brain reflects means, likely cognitively flexible
willing give try. one therapeutic advantages hypnosis well. -
Fascinating, really, going embarrass little bit. [David laughing]
positive sense, laboratory really one pioneered brain imaging
hypnotic states. And, sounds like it, understanding, correct? - Yeah,
mean, people, who've done excellent research too. - Sure. Pierre
Rainville Montreal several people,

00:26:04 ADHD

one leading labs neuroimaging hypnosis. - ask about,
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. get lot questions this. think lot
people just struggle holding attention nowadays, interference

terms enhancing focus, yes. helpful teaching people just prepare
mind narrow focus something. really engaged
reading something, writing pa- mean, that, sometimes thinking,
oh God, another hour. times hour will go think,
hey, great, that, feels game-like you, just assembling
parts puzzle putting 'em together. fun, just get absorbed,
me, hypnotic like experience, trouble, struggling,
sometimes things like self-hypnosis can help. not expert ADHD.
impression right, people constantly distracted


rather rigid. part easily distractable. upset
get distracted rather rigid want attend
can. think, way controlling this, distractibility, frankly. guess many
people ADHD, not hypnotizable, haven't studied it. So,
possible people disorder,

00:28:22 Hypnosis Stress & Sleep

training self-hypnosis might help, see hypnotizable
take there. - want return underlying neural networks
clinical applications but, sorts things aside asthma, used
hypnosis successfully others used clinical hypnosis for?
particular areas of, psychiatric challenges illnesses, guess called,
particularly amenable hypnotic treatment. - Yes, are. Hypnosis good
problem focused treatment. oldest western conception psychotherapy,
can used specific problems way helpful. found helpful
stress reduction. helping people deal, dealing stress days.
helpful, mind-body connection helpful part problem
stress perception. mentioned earlier sort good sense,
football game something, feel physical reaction. can reinforcing
thing. Wow, exciting, it. can also distracting. So, worried
getting COVID worried about, physical problem have.
notice body, body tenses up, start sweat. sympathetic
nervous system goes, heart rate goes up. notice think, oh
God, really bad. feel worse. So, like snowball rolling downhill.
feel worse body gets worse. Hypnosis can helpful
dissociating somatic reaction psychological reactions. So, teach people
imagine body floating somewhere safe comfortable like bath, lake, hot tub
floating space, picture problem stressing imaginary
screen, rule, no matter see screen, keep body
comfortable. So, point, still can't control stress, can control
physical reaction it. starts feeling control. least one
thing can manage. can use think visualize one
thing might stressor. So, hypnosis helpful controlling mind-


body interaction relation stress. helpful people get sleep.
lot fun that. getting emails people said, haven't slept right
15 years, now first time, listening app can sleep night.
helpful again, wake middle night, tell people, don't
look clock. arousal cue. wake more, picture whatever
thinking worrying imaginary screen body
floating. So, watch movie, keep body floating. many people can
use get back sleep. - using self-hypnosis sleep long time.
now Reveri app, talk relationship Reveri app
uses. find incredibly useful falling back asleep middle night.
raises question, found think understand correctly, one can self-
hypnosis daytime. issue comes later, like,
instance, self-hypnosis stress reduction, away stressful event prepare
one deal stress better. - Right. - hypnosis improving return sleep.
can done actually want go sleep. kind training
networks,

00:32:12 Hypnosis Strengthen Neural Connections

right? - right. - So, evidence that, brain networks actually form
stronger connections, people self-hypnosis time? - Well, rule
neurobiology know, neurons fire together wire together. - friend,
Carla Shatz. - Yes, Carla- - Not Donald Hebb, way. [David laughing] keep trying
to, widespread myth world unfortunately, internet,
that, fire together wire together said by, psychologist, Donald Hebb
Donald Hebb many important things, neurobiologist Carla Shatz- -
exactly right. - Who, Yes, Stanford also Berkeley Harvard. So, also
decent schools. - exactly right. - Stanford, said, fire together wire
together. deserves, - Right. - credit statement. Yeah,
repeated use self-hypnosis, one imagine networks getting
stronger. - think so. don't evidence yet, long term
potentiation provides pathway described program, number
times allow repeated activation network actually build new connections
work. least, even learning memory point view, memory


network associations. remember things. example like
give is, go back grade school see little tiny lockers
size wrong. suddenly flood memories obviously stored
there, just didn't think of. So, context association memory's about.
start acquire memories problem. So, one thing use hypnosis
treating phobias, example. problem people phobias, like
airplane phobias crossing bridge high, avoid
more, source associations memories fear. don't
good experiences 'cause avoid it. like get back horse fall
off kind thing. hypnosis, can start people able manage anxiety
enough can more, wider array experiences, start
network associations isn't negative may even positive. - almost
like a, sorry interrupt, ask. - Sure - almost like a, exposure therapy
done mind. - Yes. - always mind. mean, even exposure to,
snake phobia, don't, don't like snakes, don't think qualifies full
blown phobia. think healthy fear snakes. - Yeah. - if, say
snake phobia, typical approach in, be, cognitive behavioral approaches, right,
show picture snake, rubber snake, real snake.
Eventually person is, - Yeah. - holding boa constrictor something like that. -
[David] Right. - mind translate nervous system
signals. hypnosis, sounds like can give number positive experiences
without use props, without bring animals room. - Right,
I- - Drive someone across bridge, right? - Yes, woman,
successful business woman, high level corporation. terrible dog phobia.
imagine somebody brought dog room said, "what
doing?" see getting tense. said, "Well, waiting
see dog does." said, "If somebody works you, comes
office, freeze wait see did?" said, "Of course not,
tell 'em do." [laughs] said, "Well, immobilizing yourself, power
isn't dog you, so, imagine might engage dog
help control situation." said, "Thanks." reminds of, one
favorite stories hypnosis that, father seeing woman lived
Midtown Manhattan horrible dog phobia. dropped things, spill
coffee saw dog. time trips store, thought


least likely people walking dogs. - Now wouldn't possible, everyone
in- - [laughs] Everyone New York dog - like fleet French Bulldogs, -
Right, exactly. - taking New York City. - So, taught think dog

asked her. "Well, calling?" son said. said, "Dr. Spiegel."
boy said, "That's weird." father said, "What's weird?" said, "Spiegel's
heat." bought dog, - love it. - named it, Spiegel. - love it. - Talk
transference. - love it. [David laughing]

00:37:19 Restructuring Trauma Narratives

really speaks power this. brings back issue. So,
different about, father case woman, terms
happened hypnosis allowed go completely terrified dogs
owning dog naming father? find amusing. - Yeah. -
different just two sitting talking it, right? know,
therapy, narrative huge component. - Right. - hypnosis narrative huge
component. - Right. - must that, brain state really different.
talk trauma minutes. think people trauma
phobias, certainly conversation it. might freeze up.
might lose articulation forth. different
state combines narrative, think allow underlying neural networks
engage change? 'Cause find fascinating a- Every attempt
dealing stress phobia clinical setting involves discussion
is. - Yes. - But, not talking medication introduced,
least not particular circumstances. - Right. - So, realize kind obvious
question like, difference brain activity, find incredible.
control variable brain state. not, spoken. - raising
couple important issues, Andrew. talked earlier systematic
desensitization, sort lay hierarchy things one time.
think unsystematic desensitization, changing mental states.


think evidence mental state change
therapeutic potential. seeing ketamine treating depression,
dissociogenic drug. know every morning wake up, problem,
know, made mistake reading nasty email 11:00 PM. didn't know
do. wake morning thinking, oh, idiot, yeah,
going do. So, just changing mental state, therapeutic potential. think
underestimate ability regulate change responses cognitively,
emotionally somatically flexible. so, things, right, follow similar
principles facing problem, seeing different point view. done
really, nice podcast trauma stress expose it,
not avoid it, talked before. find way reconnect it,
substitute something can make feel good, rather bad, activate
centers brain like mesolimbic reward system. so, hypnosis
can much faster. People don't think can can.
having, right now physical experience, thinking not feeling
bad used to. can powerful thing can hypnosis. So,
woman came see me, suffered attempted rape. getting dark,
coming back grocery store guy grabs wants get
apartment. outside apartment. starts fighting
winds basilar skull fracture. runs away. cops come, since hadn't
raped, left, weren't interested. wanted use hypnosis get
better image guy looked like, painful, upsetting thing. So,
quite hypnotizable. got floating. say, safe comfortable, now, nothing
can happen will harm body. left side screen, want
picture guy approaching happening. said, really,
light, getting dark. really can't see much facial features, recognize
something, hadn't allowed remember. gets upstairs, doesn't just
want rape me, going kill me. so, ways, seeing
even worse. So, thinking, good, Spiegel, made even frightened
before. pointed PTSD stress lecture, got
confront trauma, restructure understanding it. So, side
screen, picture, protect yourself? everybody
trauma situation engages strategy self protection. salience network
kicking in. said, "You know what?" surprised fighting hard.


didn't think would. so, realized one hand even worse
thought was. hand actually probably saved life.
so, way of, helping restructure experience trauma make
tolerable. helped her- didn't recog- couldn't identify guy,
helped restructure understand experience. something
can just talking, straight psychotherapy. sometimes can hell
lot faster efficiently using hypnosis. one randomized trial
Israel shows adding hypnosis PTSD treatment, actually improves
outcome. way accomplishing things understand broader
psychotherapy world, much quickly sometimes effectively. - Yeah,
sounds like going somewhat state one trying deal with,
dissociating state key. imagine, open
various podcasts. done lot analysis years. experienced
sessions, depending show them, might just get kind
laundry list happened opposed actually feeling anything, around
happened. - Right. - think people probably vary extent can
drop feeling states can depend day. can depend well
slept night on. - one thing might add, Andrew, - Yes. -
is, notion late Gordon Bower, just memorial Gordon
Stanford. died year ago. Brilliant cognitive psychologist, one founders
cognitive psychology Stanford great pitcher. almost became Major
League pitcher decided go grad school instead, glad did.
Gordon helped establish concept state dependent memory
certain mental state, enhance ability remember things it. sort
bad example drunk hides bottle can't remember
put gets drunk mental state. People go
dissociative states traumatized. way, hypnosis helping
remember deal memories better mental state
like happened. rape victims will tell you, floating
body, feeling sorry woman assaulted below. People traumatic
episodes, just say, know, blank out, don't know happening,
autopilot kind self hypnotic state. So, use hypnosis help
deal traumatic memory, making state in, right office
you, congruent state likely in, trauma happened.


think part helps facilitate treatment trauma related disorders. -
see.

00:45:14 Ketamine Therapy

makes ask, every question ask, 'cause really feel
almost like compulsion, dissociation traumatic episode is, part
adaptive strategy. - Right. - creates certain issues, creates problems, right?
something like ketamine, creates dissociative state, useful
treatment trauma? confused days colleague,
Karl Deisseroth, also podcast coworkers figured out,
okay, layer one networks neocortex, involved
dissociative state. starting gain understanding ketamine
works neural level. - Right. - seem, certain populations can
useful treatment. don't know, never tried it. don't know current status
is, legal. allowed least in, FDA approved use.
dissociative states useful element dissociation gave rise
trauma memory first place? - Well, yeah, Karl brilliant paper
nature he, rats humans one paper. showed
rhythmic discharge retrosplenial region, triggered ketamine.
rats actually showed dissociative like behavior, hot pad
ordinarily wouldn't didn't seem much pain paw.
male subject implanted electrodes- - Human, yeah. - human subject, yeah.
electrodes picked rhythmic activity. did,
report dissociative state. description was, like pilot
airplane. felt walking cockpit plane still flying
and- - sounds terrifying me. [David laughing] sounds terrify terrifying. -
thing- - want body, [David laughing] time, know. -
right but, point is, way principal, Andrew, like, principle said,
need re-confront traumatic situation can modulate associations
it. So, accept it, accept arousal, put boundaries around
figure can approach problem approach
problem different point view. So, not surprise- fact, studied,
people disassociated Loma Prieta earthquake Oakland-Berkeley


firestorm. - remember well. - Yeah. - Earthquakes follow me. move
south Northridge quake- - going keep away So, there'll one
later, afternoon. [David laughing] - starting dissociating. So, dissociation
compartmentalize experience, means point view treating trauma,
inhibition. don't engage it. like happened there. think
happens people, sometimes good able separate
recollection. somewhere. sight not mind.
effects you, can't deal it. can't reprocess it. think
one reason ketamine might work fact, allows keep, re-approach
dissociative experience way can start think something
it. just fact can turn off. also self-hypnosis
helpful. not something just comes happens you.
something can make happen. can control it, can something it. So,
feel less helpless control. essence trauma helplessness. not
fear, not pain. helplessness. become object. become just body.
don't control going on. not used that. discussed
breathing paper anticipation breathing. not whether breathe, inhale
exhale hold breath, think can inhale can't,
really upsetting, understandably. so, issue control hypnosis,
terrible reputation taking away control actually superb way enhancing
control mind body. - love reminds naming important.
almost wonder self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis called something
else, would've separated stage hypnosis way make
less scary, weird, complicated people embrace. But, - Yeah. - part reason
discussion is, great experiences hypnosis, seen
data, talking lot clinical examples. incredibly powerful boils
right neural brain states. - Right. - And,

00:50:07 Self-directed Hypnosis, Reveri

think years come, going become widespread along lines.
quickly, described examples people getting relief quickly. -
Right. - permanent, changes? need follow related
that, sure number people listening thinking, wonderful, love


get hypnotized number different things Dr. Spiegel somebody else expert
clinical hypnosis, might not access somebody similar
training. power? So, quickly work? long lasting
changes? then, necessary work clinical hypnotist? better
self-hypnosis forth? Maybe just give us contour
landscape directed self-directed treatment. - Well, typically, people
start coming see clinician like me. better see someone licensing
training professional discipline, medicine, psychology, dentistry, whatever. -
'Cause lot hypnotists there, just hypnotist. - Right. Just
hypnotists. - Oh, okay. - key issue is, somebody can really assess
problem make sure not, talking someone reducing chest
pain, rather getting coronary artery problem- - 'Cause real
issue there. - could, right. - hypnosis might adjust wouldn't deal
deeper underlying issue. - right. hand. typically use
people, often see twice periodically, not every week.
certainly not every day, pain problem hypnosis helpful pain.
so, is, identifying hypnotizable are. give standard
brief test ability experience hypnosis, going self-hypnosis
exercise deal problem, seeing respond it,
teaching themselves. old days, used use
iPhone record part session. play back hypnosis
experience. Now developed app, "Reveri," can teach people step
through, dealing pain, stress, focus, insomnia help people eat better
stop smoking. elements take 15 minutes elements just
take one two minutes people can refresh reinforce. - Two minute hypnosis,
[indistinct] one minute. - Yes. - Yeah. - one two, one two minutes
now, finding two thirds people find even just one minute
refresher, helps feel better. reporting, feel better. So, nice thing is,
know right away, whether likely help not. found, done
studies, looking hypnosis pain relief acute medical procedures.
randomized trial published Lancet, three conditions, people getting
arterial cutdowns chemoembolized tumors liver visualize renal artery
stenosis. don't use general anesthesia this. uncomfortable people
anxious three conditions. One standard care, push


button get opioids, IV. - surgery? - surgery. second
is, that, plus friendly nurse, comforting them. So, controlled
pleasant attention support. third was, taught self-hypnosis
pain control. So, feeling, can change temperature, body
cool, tingling, numb, floating ice water feeling comfortable. go
somewhere else, leave body go desert island enjoy yourself.
found that, two half hour procedure, hour half,
hypnosis group reduced pain 80%, compared standard, - Wow. care
group, using half amount opioids, fewer complications procedure
took 17 minutes less time average get done. not patient
relaxed. treatment staff. weren't dealing someone
struggling uncomfortable. measured anxiety thing.
hypnosis group, worried dead. no anxiety hour
half, saying, fine, know, fine. standard care
group, 5 10 anxiety scores point. So, published Lancet,
big randomized trial. drug that, every hospital country
using now, no industry push it. So, part helped us decide
needed help people, Reveri teach
provide interactive support it. it, question, although is,
work long term? 'Cause can acutely doesn't necessarily carry on. So,
around randomized trial women metastatic breast cancer.
advancing disease. met support group week taught
self-hypnosis, stress anxiety pain control end. end
year, treatment group half pain control group did, same,
low amounts medication. So, lasts. say, felt pain
chest thought metastasis, just exercise. got warm bath
felt fine. So, works becomes skill people acquire, can
tell right away, whether likely help them, working clinician now using
app ways helping learn use skill. So, nice thing will
know quickly, whether likely help not. is, can learn
yourself. - great will, again, there'll link Reveri caption,
available Apple Android. think even though nominal cost there,
think that, mentioned, medications approaches dealing
problems quite expensive, potential side effects things. Not


aren't also useful. - I, get that, - Please. - just one
thing. worked hard app. iOS app Apple. decided
table moment, redoing Android app. So, available,
working Alexa platform. not moment will soon. So, just
don't want people disappointed looking Android,
agenda don't moment.

00:56:53 Eliminating Obsessive Thoughts, Superstitions

- Great, thanks clarification. hopefully, time both, get asked lot
obsessive thoughts intrusive thoughts. also get asked lot OCD.
evidence hypnosis self-hypnosis can used for, dealing obsessive
thoughts? - Sometimes, obsessional people, just turn not
hypnotizable for, yeah, not random. tend controlling
thought, busy evaluating rather experiencing, so- - know people
like that. [David laughing] sounds like adaptive mindset lot professions. -
right. - get trained that, - Yeah. - school, obsess
exam, obsess the, - Yeah. - social interactions. mean, part
becoming functional human being. yet, can take us different- -
sometimes overdo it. mean, tell one example extreme situations, that,
know, judging, evaluating, not letting experience, including
emotionally. know somebody, listens tapes airplanes go down. So,
get black box listen it. said me, know- -
profession recreational- - No, profession. - Okay. -
did. 'Cause trying accident prevention handle things.
said worry people panicking, right? guys know
got 30 seconds 45 seconds just going
checklist. said, don't panic enough. taught do.
reason, good reason it. sometimes overdo it. painful
listen 'cause know going happen. So, kind balance
hit. sometimes get emotional absorbed not
enough sort see possibilities. can problem.
hand, sometimes rigid controlled don't let emotions guide
need protect protect others. So, say


general people OCD are, less hypnotizable side spectrum,
less likely allow engage any, typical example checking
OCD example, don't remember, whether locked door turned off
gas oven keep going back keep checking. So,
evaluative component brain, kind overrides experiential one sometimes
people can get benefit, not group select
likely respond self hypnotic approaches. - superstitions similar? -
Superstitions, think more, people hypnotizable, keep
getting caught things like superstitions there, imagination supplants
reality. seen lot happening recently. think there,
possible helped learning sort see put context, see
different point view. - developed pretty vicious superstition,
college hard break, actually. always feel, talk clinicians,
reveal certain things pathology. - Please do. - so- - get
bill later. - Thank you, yes, part reason arranged this. [David laughing] No,
just kidding. yeah, did. habit knocking wood things noticed
started to, sneak knocking wood every 'cause didn't want
people think often. started realize that, becoming
little bit reflex. saw incredible video Bence Olveczky's lab
Harvard. studies motor patterns. rats press different
sequences levers turn dials order get pellet food. that,
start introduce behaviors nothing actual lever
pressing, like start scratching hind quarters things like that. hat,
heads, excuse me, don't wear hats flipping ears. just like
pitcher throwing baseball. this, - Oh, yeah. - start incorporate
motor behaviors unrelated outcome, mind somehow starts think
necessary outcome. incorporate it. So, decided
break simply forcing not week. - Mm-hm. just
seemed like ridiculous, - [Both] thing do. Yeah, well- - Knock wood. - call
response prevention works. is, set new context
brain, get outcome want, devoid extraneous behavior. - Yeah,
knew nuts, right. knew illogical. - Right.

01:01:50 ‘Hypnotizability’, Spiegel Eye-roll Test



- somehow things take meaning. - [David] Right. - So, talked about,
utility hypnosis stress reduction, phobias, pain, possibly, don't know for,
things like ADHD OCD, just will depend hypnotizability. - Right. - talked
beautiful study the, metastatic breast cancer outcome patients.
Hypnotizability clearly key variable. - Yes. - please tell us,
hypnotizability is, evaluated Spiegel Eye-Roll Test is? - Okay,
sure. So, hypnotizability just capacity hypnotic experiences.
test called hypnotic conduction profile. give highly structured hypnotic
experience. old tradition clinical hypnosis was, try bunch
different things, talking, walking upstairs downstairs images time
say breathing subject that. change
clinician, less can make variation outcome. take
long time, know, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. just view kind complex,
not effective way assessing person's hypnotic capacity. know
peak period hypnotizability human life, latency years childhood. So,
every eight year old trance time. call 'em dinner, don't
hear ya, thing. childhood wonderful
experience. Work play thing. try make little
adults, think terrible mistake. Everything fun them. enjoy learning,
enjoy everything. - age this- - like 6 10, 6 11.
playful, enjoy everything. Everything sort game fun try
make miserable them, got it. when, Piaget called,
adult cognitive framework, learn abstract concepts, learn even one
bottle looks bigger other, can equal volume. so, imposing
logic, growing DLPFC point imposing cognitive structure
experience. people start lose hypnotic ability. time
early 20s, hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed. study done
Stanford, Ernest Hillard, Phil Zimbardo this, looking at, tracked
students psych one, hypnotizability measured retested
blindly 25 years later. test, retest correlation was, want guess
was? - guessing it's, don't know, 0.6 something. - Yeah, close. 0.7, IQ
0.6, 25 year interval. - Wow. - So, stable IQ 25
year interval. So, point, are. factors


lead that? Well, means that, third adults just
not hypnotizable. Two thirds are, 15% extremely hypnotizable can
measure give number 0 10. useful.
patients it, say, look, sorry, not hypnotizable going
something else. Medication, systematic desensitization, mindfulness, things
hypnotizable, just go it. don't lot explaining. People
low moderate hypnotizable, like explanations doing,
can still get benefits. So, helps guide nature treatment
people. Now, eye roll is, father used use eye fixation induction, used
say, look ceiling now close eyes looking up. very,
yes, very- - Yeah [indistinct] [laughs]. - noticed two patients back
back. one woman seen work with, hysterical seizures.
just suddenly start shaking. And- - Real epileptic seizures? - No, pseudo
epileptic seizures. - see, hysteria. - Hysteria, although people both,
the, people, real epilepsy becomes framework gets elaborated on,
stressed, seizures. just pseudo epilepsy, no EEG
abnormalities. really something watch. husband move
work bench near door, started seizure, run home
try help it. bad. noticed
did, looked up, one seizure events, see
sclera, don't see Iris anymore. start seize. great thing
her. taught seizures. Everybody else telling stop.
made one. hypnotized her, [indistinct] go back last time
one sure enough, start shake. gradually make smaller
smaller. So, learning control, access, like
PTSD, confront, don't avoid it, don't suppress it. confront figure
deal it. next patient rigid obsessional businessman
wanted stop controlling [chuckles], reminded me,
New Yorker cartoon driver, comes yield sign yells, "Never!"
always [indistinct]. - sounds right, New Yorker. - Yeah, New
Yorker. so, guy, tried look up, couldn't keep eyes
closed them. so, father started testing people. seemed
rough correlation capacity keep eyes up, closed
measured hypnotizability. - people listening [stutters], watching


video. So, Spiegel Eye-Roll Test, involves looking ceiling. So, tilting
head back, tilting chin back looking ceiling now. also
directing eyes upward eyes open. eye roll test involves
then, closing eyelids eyes open. - open. - whether not,
eyes roll back said it, see sclera, white part. - see sclera,
white part. - means you're, hypnotizable moderately hypnotizable. -
Right. - Whereas eyes move see iris, colored part eye
eyes close, less hypnotizable. - Right. - can look online there, just
put Spiegel Eye-Roll Test find it. also going actual
example hypnosis video later. - Right. So, asking brain something
difficult, keep eyes closing eyelids. contradictory signals
third, fourth sixth cranial nerve nuclei control eye movement. - said
third- - Fourth six, - Yup. - cranial nerve nuclei. suspending one
activity, asking another eye movements lot levels
consciousness. periaqueductal gray, surrounds cranial nerve nuclei.
close eyes sleep, rapid eye movement dream.
drugs, affect level consciousness, can affect eyes eye movements,
either dilation contraction pupils, depending whether stimulant
opioid. - Stimulants, make pupils big. - Big, right? - Yeah. Like cocaine,
amphetamine. - Right, exactly. - Things sort. - opioids, get constricted
pupils. - parents looking kids coming door late night,
looking substance abuse. - right. - Yeah. - So, something
eyes lot level consciousness. mean, obviously, close
eyes go sleep, rapid eye movement dreaming.
So, not surprising. old Zen practice called, looking third eye.
think part reason happens is, looking inside like
third eye two forehead. think
visual creatures, pretty pathetic physical point view. Many animals
can outrun us, outs smell us eagles read newsprint hundred yards
can't. So, major defensive sensory input vision. animals,
predator animals eyes front head, good,
detailed vision prey. Whereas prey animals like deer, eyes side
head. So, don't see things well, much bigger range potential
see threat. mainly use, fact, interesting, social


anthropologists say, gather do, coastlines edge
forest something, got protection back. Something can
attack one side big vision might threaten you.
tend attracted kinds physical situations, so- - Yeah, love vistas. -
love vistas, right. - Vistas calming. take us panoramic
vision. - right. - didn't know this, turns scenic spots
location national parks people naturally aggregated was-
makes sense. - Sure. - But, signs locations built around, people's
tendency animals tendencies. - Oh, really [indistinct]? - aggregate there. Yeah,
interesting book history national parks says, didn't
give research study support it, no Google Maps, obviously. -
interesting. - Yeah, panorama visual boundaries really interesting. think,
eyes, know, two pieces central nervous system brain,
outside the- - Right. used say eyes outside skull neuro-
ophthalmologist wrote vehemently pointed outside
cranial vault, so, know. outside cranial vault two pieces
brain there. so, mentioned cranial nerves, three, four six.
isn't neuroanatomy course maybe go little deeper there. So, said
contradictory activity, looking controlled one set cranial nerves.
closing eyelids, controlled another cranial nerve. - No,
one. think six close eyes, activate, no, facial,
guess facial nerve. 7, yeah. - 7, yeah. - looking up, activating
muscles force eyes look up. closing eyelids normally relaxes
those, relaxes upper movement, eyes closed don't
need it. breaking usual customary pattern. - like rubbing the, -
Right. - hey, can't even it, see like the, - Right. [Andrew David laughing] -
exactly right. - Rubbing tummy patting head. bit
conflict there, - Right. - clinically, good probe you, - has. -
father. So, Spiegel senior Spiegel junior? - Spiegel senior. -
developed Spiegel Eye-Roll Test. - key issue this, normally
close eyes also, going sleep. not worried going
world anymore. Here, maintaining resting alertness. So, focusing
turning inward. unusual state. Normally close eyes periodically,
to, close eyes period time, normally go


sleep not worried detecting risk threat. So, interesting state
turning inward, basically, looking up, shutting eyes
allowing whatever happens outside happen focusing
going inward. So, think signal brain turn inward. - interesting.
meditation course, done eyes open almost always done
eyes closed. - Yes, right. - interesting. So, can quickly determine
whether not someone highly hypnotizable. - Right. - not hypnotizable.
said two thirds people can hypnotized. - Right. - Obviously third cannot.
within two thirds can, range, said 15% people fall
this, highly hypnotizable category. - Right, correct. - seem member
of. - Yeah. - And, repeated use self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis, increase
change hypnotizability, can access first place? - say
general, may increase little bit, not hell lot, not worth effort
increase hypnotizability point. worth trying deal problem,
dealing with. So, can get better using level have.
study done tried train people hypnotizable
obviously, there're subjective behavioral components test, can learn
little better them. found reanalyze data,
account three times final score, based initial hypnotizability
measurement, rather whether not trained better. So,
can improve little

01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)

not worth trouble. - Got it. Along lines eyes eye movements, lot
interest EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. -
Shapiro working, wasn't Stanford directly, local
Stanford. - Yeah. - think Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - thoughts
EMDR? useful, think less useful? things
EMDR combined make useful? listeners podcast
come to, think, come podcast range backgrounds interests. me,
makes sense EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given newer
data can suppress amygdala activity animals animal models
humans well. really hasn't explored much, neurally. heard things like,


coordinates two sides brain, it, just throwaway. don't think
evidence that, coordinating two sides brain better not
coordinating. wouldn't speaking right now two sides brain, well
correlated. - Yeah. - language lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - heard
mimics, rapid eye movements sleep, actually doesn't. So, - Right. -
heard people talk positive experiences EMDR.
thoughts EMDR? - Yeah, good comment one recent
podcasts. tell you, one way sort think bemused point view,
old, mentioned earlier, oldest sort idea hypnotic induction,
dangling watch, right? [indistinct] watch. And, fact, enough concern
automobiles invented, movement prevent
installing windshield wipers people afraid hypnotized,
watched windshield wipers go back forth car. Now, turns
fortunately that, tend not look windshield wipers. keep looking
windshield. so, windshield wipers today. movement is,
exactly used hypnotic induction. think lot hypnosis EMDR. - Ah. -
think, combination exposure based treatments, use
EMDR think it. tend not process experience much just
physical part it, personally think drawback. And, every study seen
dismantling study. no question people go EMDR, many
get better trauma related problems VA big program using
on. every program dismantled, going treatment
lateral eye movement, shown lateral eye movement, doesn't add
anything it. toward end career, Francine [indistinct]
contralateral touching something, wasn't eye movements anymore.
things. So, tend think that, EMDR another form exposure based therapy
trauma, implied exception possible new data, certainly
doesn't with, rapid eye movement sleep. don't think moving eyes
issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put

body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat

not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,

mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes

real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,
watch it, try [stutters]. work enjoying together shows
breathing patterns may increase sympathetic arousal may decrease. may

absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go

impression right, people constantly distracted

00:28:22 Hypnosis Stress & Sleep

training self-hypnosis might help, see hypnotizable
take there. - want return underlying neural networks
clinical applications but, sorts things aside asthma, used
hypnosis successfully others used clinical hypnosis for?
particular areas of, psychiatric challenges illnesses, guess called,
particularly amenable hypnotic treatment. - Yes, are. Hypnosis good
problem focused treatment. oldest western conception psychotherapy,
can used specific problems way helpful. found helpful
stress reduction. helping people deal, dealing stress days.
helpful, mind-body connection helpful part problem
stress perception. mentioned earlier sort good sense,
football game something, feel physical reaction. can reinforcing
thing. Wow, exciting, it. can also distracting. So, worried
getting COVID worried about, physical problem have.
notice body, body tenses up, start sweat. sympathetic
nervous system goes, heart rate goes up. notice think, oh
God, really bad. feel worse. So, like snowball rolling downhill.
feel worse body gets worse. Hypnosis can helpful
dissociating somatic reaction psychological reactions. So, teach people
imagine body floating somewhere safe comfortable like bath, lake, hot tub
floating space, picture problem stressing imaginary
screen, rule, no matter see screen, keep body
comfortable. So, point, still can't control stress, can control
physical reaction it. starts feeling control. least one
thing can manage. can use think visualize one
thing might stressor. So, hypnosis helpful controlling mind-


body interaction relation stress. helpful people get sleep.
lot fun that. getting emails people said, haven't slept right
15 years, now first time, listening app can sleep night.
helpful again, wake middle night, tell people, don't
look clock. arousal cue. wake more, picture whatever
thinking worrying imaginary screen body
floating. So, watch movie, keep body floating. many people can
use get back sleep. - using self-hypnosis sleep long time.

raises question, found think understand correctly, one can self-

instance, self-hypnosis stress reduction, away stressful event prepare
one deal stress better. - Right. - hypnosis improving return sleep.
can done actually want go sleep. kind training
networks,

00:32:12 Hypnosis Strengthen Neural Connections

right? - right. - So, evidence that, brain networks actually form
stronger connections, people self-hypnosis time? - Well, rule
neurobiology know, neurons fire together wire together. - friend,
Carla Shatz. - Yes, Carla- - Not Donald Hebb, way. [David laughing] keep trying
to, widespread myth world unfortunately, internet,
that, fire together wire together said by, psychologist, Donald Hebb
Donald Hebb many important things, neurobiologist Carla Shatz- -
exactly right. - Who, Yes, Stanford also Berkeley Harvard. So, also
decent schools. - exactly right. - Stanford, said, fire together wire
together. deserves, - Right. - credit statement. Yeah,
repeated use self-hypnosis, one imagine networks getting
stronger. - think so. don't evidence yet, long term
potentiation provides pathway described program, number
times allow repeated activation network actually build new connections
work. least, even learning memory point view, memory


network associations. remember things. example like
give is, go back grade school see little tiny lockers
size wrong. suddenly flood memories obviously stored
there, just didn't think of. So, context association memory's about.
start acquire memories problem. So, one thing use hypnosis
treating phobias, example. problem people phobias, like
airplane phobias crossing bridge high, avoid
more, source associations memories fear. don't
good experiences 'cause avoid it. like get back horse fall
off kind thing. hypnosis, can start people able manage anxiety
enough can more, wider array experiences, start
network associations isn't negative may even positive. - almost
like a, sorry interrupt, ask. - Sure - almost like a, exposure therapy
done mind. - Yes. - always mind. mean, even exposure to,
snake phobia, don't, don't like snakes, don't think qualifies full
blown phobia. think healthy fear snakes. - Yeah. - if, say
snake phobia, typical approach in, be, cognitive behavioral approaches, right,
show picture snake, rubber snake, real snake.
Eventually person is, - Yeah. - holding boa constrictor something like that. -
[David] Right. - mind translate nervous system
signals. hypnosis, sounds like can give number positive experiences
without use props, without bring animals room. - Right,
I- - Drive someone across bridge, right? - Yes, woman,
successful business woman, high level corporation. terrible dog phobia.
imagine somebody brought dog room said, "what
doing?" see getting tense. said, "Well, waiting
see dog does." said, "If somebody works you, comes
office, freeze wait see did?" said, "Of course not,
tell 'em do." [laughs] said, "Well, immobilizing yourself, power
isn't dog you, so, imagine might engage dog
help control situation." said, "Thanks." reminds of, one
favorite stories hypnosis that, father seeing woman lived
Midtown Manhattan horrible dog phobia. dropped things, spill
coffee saw dog. time trips store, thought


least likely people walking dogs. - Now wouldn't possible, everyone
in- - [laughs] Everyone New York dog - like fleet French Bulldogs, -
Right, exactly. - taking New York City. - So, taught think dog
friend, neighbor dog, bring dog hold dog collar
make sure, gradually able stroke dog say, dog friend
distinguish wild tame animals. animals, afraid
[murmurs]. So, seemed better. called back three months later
asked her. "Well, calling?" son said. said, "Dr. Spiegel."
boy said, "That's weird." father said, "What's weird?" said, "Spiegel's
heat." bought dog, - love it. - named it, Spiegel. - love it. - Talk
transference. - love it. [David laughing]

00:37:19 Restructuring Trauma Narratives

really speaks power this. brings back issue. So,
different about, father case woman, terms
happened hypnosis allowed go completely terrified dogs
owning dog naming father? find amusing. - Yeah. -
different just two sitting talking it, right? know,
therapy, narrative huge component. - Right. - hypnosis narrative huge
component. - Right. - must that, brain state really different.
talk trauma minutes. think people trauma
phobias, certainly conversation it. might freeze up.
might lose articulation forth. different
state combines narrative, think allow underlying neural networks
engage change? 'Cause find fascinating a- Every attempt
dealing stress phobia clinical setting involves discussion
is. - Yes. - But, not talking medication introduced,
least not particular circumstances. - Right. - So, realize kind obvious
question like, difference brain activity, find incredible.
control variable brain state. not, spoken. - raising
couple important issues, Andrew. talked earlier systematic
desensitization, sort lay hierarchy things one time.
think unsystematic desensitization, changing mental states.


think evidence mental state change
therapeutic potential. seeing ketamine treating depression,
dissociogenic drug. know every morning wake up, problem,
know, made mistake reading nasty email 11:00 PM. didn't know
do. wake morning thinking, oh, idiot, yeah,
going do. So, just changing mental state, therapeutic potential. think
underestimate ability regulate change responses cognitively,
emotionally somatically flexible. so, things, right, follow similar
principles facing problem, seeing different point view. done
really, nice podcast trauma stress expose it,
not avoid it, talked before. find way reconnect it,
substitute something can make feel good, rather bad, activate
centers brain like mesolimbic reward system. so, hypnosis
can much faster. People don't think can can.
having, right now physical experience, thinking not feeling
bad used to. can powerful thing can hypnosis. So,
woman came see me, suffered attempted rape. getting dark,
coming back grocery store guy grabs wants get
apartment. outside apartment. starts fighting
winds basilar skull fracture. runs away. cops come, since hadn't
raped, left, weren't interested. wanted use hypnosis get
better image guy looked like, painful, upsetting thing. So,
quite hypnotizable. got floating. say, safe comfortable, now, nothing
can happen will harm body. left side screen, want
picture guy approaching happening. said, really,
light, getting dark. really can't see much facial features, recognize
something, hadn't allowed remember. gets upstairs, doesn't just
want rape me, going kill me. so, ways, seeing
even worse. So, thinking, good, Spiegel, made even frightened
before. pointed PTSD stress lecture, got
confront trauma, restructure understanding it. So, side
screen, picture, protect yourself? everybody
trauma situation engages strategy self protection. salience network
kicking in. said, "You know what?" surprised fighting hard.


didn't think would. so, realized one hand even worse
thought was. hand actually probably saved life.
so, way of, helping restructure experience trauma make
tolerable. helped her- didn't recog- couldn't identify guy,
helped restructure understand experience. something
can just talking, straight psychotherapy. sometimes can hell
lot faster efficiently using hypnosis. one randomized trial
Israel shows adding hypnosis PTSD treatment, actually improves
outcome. way accomplishing things understand broader
psychotherapy world, much quickly sometimes effectively. - Yeah,
sounds like going somewhat state one trying deal with,
dissociating state key. imagine, open
various podcasts. done lot analysis years. experienced
sessions, depending show them, might just get kind
laundry list happened opposed actually feeling anything, around
happened. - Right. - think people probably vary extent can
drop feeling states can depend day. can depend well
slept night on. - one thing might add, Andrew, - Yes. -
is, notion late Gordon Bower, just memorial Gordon
Stanford. died year ago. Brilliant cognitive psychologist, one founders
cognitive psychology Stanford great pitcher. almost became Major
League pitcher decided go grad school instead, glad did.
Gordon helped establish concept state dependent memory
certain mental state, enhance ability remember things it. sort
bad example drunk hides bottle can't remember
put gets drunk mental state. People go
dissociative states traumatized. way, hypnosis helping
remember deal memories better mental state
like happened. rape victims will tell you, floating
body, feeling sorry woman assaulted below. People traumatic
episodes, just say, know, blank out, don't know happening,
autopilot kind self hypnotic state. So, use hypnosis help
deal traumatic memory, making state in, right office
you, congruent state likely in, trauma happened.


think part helps facilitate treatment trauma related disorders. -
see.

00:45:14 Ketamine Therapy

makes ask, every question ask, 'cause really feel
almost like compulsion, dissociation traumatic episode is, part
adaptive strategy. - Right. - creates certain issues, creates problems, right?
something like ketamine, creates dissociative state, useful
treatment trauma? confused days colleague,
Karl Deisseroth, also podcast coworkers figured out,
okay, layer one networks neocortex, involved
dissociative state. starting gain understanding ketamine
works neural level. - Right. - seem, certain populations can
useful treatment. don't know, never tried it. don't know current status
is, legal. allowed least in, FDA approved use.
dissociative states useful element dissociation gave rise
trauma memory first place? - Well, yeah, Karl brilliant paper
nature he, rats humans one paper. showed
rhythmic discharge retrosplenial region, triggered ketamine.
rats actually showed dissociative like behavior, hot pad
ordinarily wouldn't didn't seem much pain paw.
male subject implanted electrodes- - Human, yeah. - human subject, yeah.
electrodes picked rhythmic activity. did,
report dissociative state. description was, like pilot
airplane. felt walking cockpit plane still flying
and- - sounds terrifying me. [David laughing] sounds terrify terrifying. -
thing- - want body, [David laughing] time, know. -
right but, point is, way principal, Andrew, like, principle said,
need re-confront traumatic situation can modulate associations
it. So, accept it, accept arousal, put boundaries around
figure can approach problem approach
problem different point view. So, not surprise- fact, studied,
people disassociated Loma Prieta earthquake Oakland-Berkeley


firestorm. - remember well. - Yeah. - Earthquakes follow me. move
south Northridge quake- - going keep away So, there'll one
later, afternoon. [David laughing] - starting dissociating. So, dissociation
compartmentalize experience, means point view treating trauma,
inhibition. don't engage it. like happened there. think
happens people, sometimes good able separate
recollection. somewhere. sight not mind.
effects you, can't deal it. can't reprocess it. think
one reason ketamine might work fact, allows keep, re-approach
dissociative experience way can start think something
it. just fact can turn off. also self-hypnosis
helpful. not something just comes happens you.
something can make happen. can control it, can something it. So,
feel less helpless control. essence trauma helplessness. not
fear, not pain. helplessness. become object. become just body.
don't control going on. not used that. discussed
breathing paper anticipation breathing. not whether breathe, inhale
exhale hold breath, think can inhale can't,
really upsetting, understandably. so, issue control hypnosis,
terrible reputation taking away control actually superb way enhancing
control mind body. - love reminds naming important.
almost wonder self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis called something
else, would've separated stage hypnosis way make
less scary, weird, complicated people embrace. But, - Yeah. - part reason
discussion is, great experiences hypnosis, seen
data, talking lot clinical examples. incredibly powerful boils
right neural brain states. - Right. - And,

00:50:07 Self-directed Hypnosis, Reveri

think years come, going become widespread along lines.
quickly, described examples people getting relief quickly. -
Right. - permanent, changes? need follow related
that, sure number people listening thinking, wonderful, love


get hypnotized number different things Dr. Spiegel somebody else expert
clinical hypnosis, might not access somebody similar
training. power? So, quickly work? long lasting
changes? then, necessary work clinical hypnotist? better
self-hypnosis forth? Maybe just give us contour
landscape directed self-directed treatment. - Well, typically, people
start coming see clinician like me. better see someone licensing
training professional discipline, medicine, psychology, dentistry, whatever. -
'Cause lot hypnotists there, just hypnotist. - Right. Just
hypnotists. - Oh, okay. - key issue is, somebody can really assess
problem make sure not, talking someone reducing chest
pain, rather getting coronary artery problem- - 'Cause real
issue there. - could, right. - hypnosis might adjust wouldn't deal
deeper underlying issue. - right. hand. typically use
people, often see twice periodically, not every week.
certainly not every day, pain problem hypnosis helpful pain.
so, is, identifying hypnotizable are. give standard
brief test ability experience hypnosis, going self-hypnosis
exercise deal problem, seeing respond it,
teaching themselves. old days, used use
iPhone record part session. play back hypnosis
experience. Now developed app, "Reveri," can teach people step
through, dealing pain, stress, focus, insomnia help people eat better
stop smoking. elements take 15 minutes elements just
take one two minutes people can refresh reinforce. - Two minute hypnosis,
[indistinct] one minute. - Yes. - Yeah. - one two, one two minutes
now, finding two thirds people find even just one minute
refresher, helps feel better. reporting, feel better. So, nice thing is,
know right away, whether likely help not. found, done
studies, looking hypnosis pain relief acute medical procedures.
randomized trial published Lancet, three conditions, people getting
arterial cutdowns chemoembolized tumors liver visualize renal artery
stenosis. don't use general anesthesia this. uncomfortable people
anxious three conditions. One standard care, push


button get opioids, IV. - surgery? - surgery. second

pleasant attention support. third was, taught self-hypnosis
pain control. So, feeling, can change temperature, body
cool, tingling, numb, floating ice water feeling comfortable. go

found that, two half hour procedure, hour half,

hypnosis group, worried dead. no anxiety hour

00:56:53 Eliminating Obsessive Thoughts, Superstitions

- Great, thanks clarification. hopefully, time both, get asked lot
obsessive thoughts intrusive thoughts. also get asked lot OCD.
evidence hypnosis self-hypnosis can used for, dealing obsessive
thoughts? - Sometimes, obsessional people, just turn not
hypnotizable for, yeah, not random. tend controlling
thought, busy evaluating rather experiencing, so- - know people
like that. [David laughing] sounds like adaptive mindset lot professions. -
right. - get trained that, - Yeah. - school, obsess
exam, obsess the, - Yeah. - social interactions. mean, part
becoming functional human being. yet, can take us different- -
sometimes overdo it. mean, tell one example extreme situations, that,
know, judging, evaluating, not letting experience, including
emotionally. know somebody, listens tapes airplanes go down. So,
get black box listen it. said me, know- -
profession recreational- - No, profession. - Okay. -
did. 'Cause trying accident prevention handle things.
said worry people panicking, right? guys know
got 30 seconds 45 seconds just going
checklist. said, don't panic enough. taught do.
reason, good reason it. sometimes overdo it. painful
listen 'cause know going happen. So, kind balance
hit. sometimes get emotional absorbed not
enough sort see possibilities. can problem.
hand, sometimes rigid controlled don't let emotions guide
need protect protect others. So, say


general people OCD are, less hypnotizable side spectrum,
less likely allow engage any, typical example checking
OCD example, don't remember, whether locked door turned off
gas oven keep going back keep checking. So,
evaluative component brain, kind overrides experiential one sometimes
people can get benefit, not group select
likely respond self hypnotic approaches. - superstitions similar? -
Superstitions, think more, people hypnotizable, keep
getting caught things like superstitions there, imagination supplants
reality. seen lot happening recently. think there,
possible helped learning sort see put context, see
different point view. - developed pretty vicious superstition,
college hard break, actually. always feel, talk clinicians,
reveal certain things pathology. - Please do. - so- - get
bill later. - Thank you, yes, part reason arranged this. [David laughing] No,
just kidding. yeah, did. habit knocking wood things noticed
started to, sneak knocking wood every 'cause didn't want
people think often. started realize that, becoming
little bit reflex. saw incredible video Bence Olveczky's lab
Harvard. studies motor patterns. rats press different
sequences levers turn dials order get pellet food. that,
start introduce behaviors nothing actual lever
pressing, like start scratching hind quarters things like that. hat,
heads, excuse me, don't wear hats flipping ears. just like
pitcher throwing baseball. this, - Oh, yeah. - start incorporate
motor behaviors unrelated outcome, mind somehow starts think
necessary outcome. incorporate it. So, decided
break simply forcing not week. - Mm-hm. just
seemed like ridiculous, - [Both] thing do. Yeah, well- - Knock wood. - call
response prevention works. is, set new context
brain, get outcome want, devoid extraneous behavior. - Yeah,
knew nuts, right. knew illogical. - Right.

01:01:50 ‘Hypnotizability’, Spiegel Eye-roll Test



- somehow things take meaning. - [David] Right. - So, talked about,
utility hypnosis stress reduction, phobias, pain, possibly, don't know for,
things like ADHD OCD, just will depend hypnotizability. - Right. - talked
beautiful study the, metastatic breast cancer outcome patients.
Hypnotizability clearly key variable. - Yes. - please tell us,
hypnotizability is, evaluated Spiegel Eye-Roll Test is? - Okay,
sure. So, hypnotizability just capacity hypnotic experiences.
test called hypnotic conduction profile. give highly structured hypnotic
experience. old tradition clinical hypnosis was, try bunch
different things, talking, walking upstairs downstairs images time
say breathing subject that. change
clinician, less can make variation outcome. take
long time, know, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. just view kind complex,
not effective way assessing person's hypnotic capacity. know
peak period hypnotizability human life, latency years childhood. So,
every eight year old trance time. call 'em dinner, don't
hear ya, thing. childhood wonderful
experience. Work play thing. try make little
adults, think terrible mistake. Everything fun them. enjoy learning,
enjoy everything. - age this- - like 6 10, 6 11.
playful, enjoy everything. Everything sort game fun try
make miserable them, got it. when, Piaget called,
adult cognitive framework, learn abstract concepts, learn even one
bottle looks bigger other, can equal volume. so, imposing
logic, growing DLPFC point imposing cognitive structure
experience. people start lose hypnotic ability. time
early 20s, hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed. study done
Stanford, Ernest Hillard, Phil Zimbardo this, looking at, tracked
students psych one, hypnotizability measured retested
blindly 25 years later. test, retest correlation was, want guess
was? - guessing it's, don't know, 0.6 something. - Yeah, close. 0.7, IQ
0.6, 25 year interval. - Wow. - So, stable IQ 25
year interval. So, point, are. factors


lead that? Well, means that, third adults just
not hypnotizable. Two thirds are, 15% extremely hypnotizable can
measure give number 0 10. useful.
patients it, say, look, sorry, not hypnotizable going
something else. Medication, systematic desensitization, mindfulness, things
hypnotizable, just go it. don't lot explaining. People
low moderate hypnotizable, like explanations doing,
can still get benefits. So, helps guide nature treatment
people. Now, eye roll is, father used use eye fixation induction, used
say, look ceiling now close eyes looking up. very,
yes, very- - Yeah [indistinct] [laughs]. - noticed two patients back
back. one woman seen work with, hysterical seizures.
just suddenly start shaking. And- - Real epileptic seizures? - No, pseudo
epileptic seizures. - see, hysteria. - Hysteria, although people both,
the, people, real epilepsy becomes framework gets elaborated on,
stressed, seizures. just pseudo epilepsy, no EEG
abnormalities. really something watch. husband move
work bench near door, started seizure, run home
try help it. bad. noticed
did, looked up, one seizure events, see
sclera, don't see Iris anymore. start seize. great thing
her. taught seizures. Everybody else telling stop.
made one. hypnotized her, [indistinct] go back last time
one sure enough, start shake. gradually make smaller
smaller. So, learning control, access, like
PTSD, confront, don't avoid it, don't suppress it. confront figure
deal it. next patient rigid obsessional businessman
wanted stop controlling [chuckles], reminded me,
New Yorker cartoon driver, comes yield sign yells, "Never!"
always [indistinct]. - sounds right, New Yorker. - Yeah, New
Yorker. so, guy, tried look up, couldn't keep eyes
closed them. so, father started testing people. seemed
rough correlation capacity keep eyes up, closed
measured hypnotizability. - people listening [stutters], watching


video. So, Spiegel Eye-Roll Test, involves looking ceiling. So, tilting
head back, tilting chin back looking ceiling now. also
directing eyes upward eyes open. eye roll test involves
then, closing eyelids eyes open. - open. - whether not,
eyes roll back said it, see sclera, white part. - see sclera,
white part. - means you're, hypnotizable moderately hypnotizable. -
Right. - Whereas eyes move see iris, colored part eye
eyes close, less hypnotizable. - Right. - can look online there, just
put Spiegel Eye-Roll Test find it. also going actual
example hypnosis video later. - Right. So, asking brain something
difficult, keep eyes closing eyelids. contradictory signals
third, fourth sixth cranial nerve nuclei control eye movement. - said
third- - Fourth six, - Yup. - cranial nerve nuclei. suspending one
activity, asking another eye movements lot levels
consciousness. periaqueductal gray, surrounds cranial nerve nuclei.
close eyes sleep, rapid eye movement dream.
drugs, affect level consciousness, can affect eyes eye movements,
either dilation contraction pupils, depending whether stimulant
opioid. - Stimulants, make pupils big. - Big, right? - Yeah. Like cocaine,
amphetamine. - Right, exactly. - Things sort. - opioids, get constricted
pupils. - parents looking kids coming door late night,
looking substance abuse. - right. - Yeah. - So, something
eyes lot level consciousness. mean, obviously, close
eyes go sleep, rapid eye movement dreaming.
So, not surprising. old Zen practice called, looking third eye.
think part reason happens is, looking inside like
third eye two forehead. think
visual creatures, pretty pathetic physical point view. Many animals
can outrun us, outs smell us eagles read newsprint hundred yards
can't. So, major defensive sensory input vision. animals,
predator animals eyes front head, good,
detailed vision prey. Whereas prey animals like deer, eyes side
head. So, don't see things well, much bigger range potential
see threat. mainly use, fact, interesting, social


anthropologists say, gather do, coastlines edge
forest something, got protection back. Something can
attack one side big vision might threaten you.
tend attracted kinds physical situations, so- - Yeah, love vistas. -
love vistas, right. - Vistas calming. take us panoramic
vision. - right. - didn't know this, turns scenic spots
location national parks people naturally aggregated was-
makes sense. - Sure. - But, signs locations built around, people's
tendency animals tendencies. - Oh, really [indistinct]? - aggregate there. Yeah,
interesting book history national parks says, didn't
give research study support it, no Google Maps, obviously. -
interesting. - Yeah, panorama visual boundaries really interesting. think,
eyes, know, two pieces central nervous system brain,
outside the- - Right. used say eyes outside skull neuro-
ophthalmologist wrote vehemently pointed outside
cranial vault, so, know. outside cranial vault two pieces
brain there. so, mentioned cranial nerves, three, four six.
isn't neuroanatomy course maybe go little deeper there. So, said
contradictory activity, looking controlled one set cranial nerves.
closing eyelids, controlled another cranial nerve. - No,
one. think six close eyes, activate, no, facial,
guess facial nerve. 7, yeah. - 7, yeah. - looking up, activating
muscles force eyes look up. closing eyelids normally relaxes
those, relaxes upper movement, eyes closed don't
need it. breaking usual customary pattern. - like rubbing the, -
Right. - hey, can't even it, see like the, - Right. [Andrew David laughing] -
exactly right. - Rubbing tummy patting head. bit
conflict there, - Right. - clinically, good probe you, - has. -
father. So, Spiegel senior Spiegel junior? - Spiegel senior. -
developed Spiegel Eye-Roll Test. - key issue this, normally
close eyes also, going sleep. not worried going
world anymore. Here, maintaining resting alertness. So, focusing
turning inward. unusual state. Normally close eyes periodically,
to, close eyes period time, normally go


sleep not worried detecting risk threat. So, interesting state
turning inward, basically, looking up, shutting eyes
allowing whatever happens outside happen focusing
going inward. So, think signal brain turn inward. - interesting.
meditation course, done eyes open almost always done
eyes closed. - Yes, right. - interesting. So, can quickly determine
whether not someone highly hypnotizable. - Right. - not hypnotizable.
said two thirds people can hypnotized. - Right. - Obviously third cannot.
within two thirds can, range, said 15% people fall
this, highly hypnotizable category. - Right, correct. - seem member
of. - Yeah. - And, repeated use self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis, increase
change hypnotizability, can access first place? - say
general, may increase little bit, not hell lot, not worth effort
increase hypnotizability point. worth trying deal problem,
dealing with. So, can get better using level have.
study done tried train people hypnotizable
obviously, there're subjective behavioral components test, can learn
little better them. found reanalyze data,
account three times final score, based initial hypnotizability
measurement, rather whether not trained better. So,
can improve little

01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)

not worth trouble. - Got it. Along lines eyes eye movements, lot
interest EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. -
Shapiro working, wasn't Stanford directly, local
Stanford. - Yeah. - think Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - thoughts
EMDR? useful, think less useful? things
EMDR combined make useful? listeners podcast
come to, think, come podcast range backgrounds interests. me,
makes sense EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given newer
data can suppress amygdala activity animals animal models
humans well. really hasn't explored much, neurally. heard things like,


coordinates two sides brain, it, just throwaway. don't think
evidence that, coordinating two sides brain better not
coordinating. wouldn't speaking right now two sides brain, well
correlated. - Yeah. - language lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - heard
mimics, rapid eye movements sleep, actually doesn't. So, - Right. -
heard people talk positive experiences EMDR.
thoughts EMDR? - Yeah, good comment one recent
podcasts. tell you, one way sort think bemused point view,
old, mentioned earlier, oldest sort idea hypnotic induction,
dangling watch, right? [indistinct] watch. And, fact, enough concern
automobiles invented, movement prevent
installing windshield wipers people afraid hypnotized,
watched windshield wipers go back forth car. Now, turns
fortunately that, tend not look windshield wipers. keep looking
windshield. so, windshield wipers today. movement is,
exactly used hypnotic induction. think lot hypnosis EMDR. - Ah. -
think, combination exposure based treatments, use
EMDR think it. tend not process experience much just
physical part it, personally think drawback. And, every study seen
dismantling study. no question people go EMDR, many
get better trauma related problems VA big program using
on. every program dismantled, going treatment
lateral eye movement, shown lateral eye movement, doesn't add
anything it. toward end career, Francine [indistinct]

things. So, tend think that, EMDR another form exposure based therapy
trauma, implied exception possible new data, certainly
doesn't with, rapid eye movement sleep. don't think moving eyes
issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put
weight this, going re-injure ankle example, simply mean
body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat
something coming opportunity something ameliorate situation. So,
not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding
happening. face also say, opportunity
something it. minute realistically enha- doesn't mean,
imagine away heart attack. means figure rehabilitate heart attack


broken leg something like way get much control

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body
floating, safe comfortable. Now, picture Mary sit feeling sadness
no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement

01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing

we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described

important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring

Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,

absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go

giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much

meantime, people interested exploring clinical hypnosis, working
somebody similar? centralized resource people can go find, really
well-trained hypnotists? - two good professional organizations will help
that. One society clinical experimental hypnosis. think

people ADHD, not hypnotizable, haven't studied it. So,
possible people disorder,

00:28:22 Hypnosis Stress & Sleep

training self-hypnosis might help, see hypnotizable
take there. - want return underlying neural networks
clinical applications but, sorts things aside asthma, used
hypnosis successfully others used clinical hypnosis for?
particular areas of, psychiatric challenges illnesses, guess called,
particularly amenable hypnotic treatment. - Yes, are. Hypnosis good
problem focused treatment. oldest western conception psychotherapy,
can used specific problems way helpful. found helpful
stress reduction. helping people deal, dealing stress days.
helpful, mind-body connection helpful part problem
stress perception. mentioned earlier sort good sense,
football game something, feel physical reaction. can reinforcing
thing. Wow, exciting, it. can also distracting. So, worried
getting COVID worried about, physical problem have.
notice body, body tenses up, start sweat. sympathetic
nervous system goes, heart rate goes up. notice think, oh
God, really bad. feel worse. So, like snowball rolling downhill.
feel worse body gets worse. Hypnosis can helpful
dissociating somatic reaction psychological reactions. So, teach people
imagine body floating somewhere safe comfortable like bath, lake, hot tub
floating space, picture problem stressing imaginary
screen, rule, no matter see screen, keep body
comfortable. So, point, still can't control stress, can control
physical reaction it. starts feeling control. least one
thing can manage. can use think visualize one
thing might stressor. So, hypnosis helpful controlling mind-


body interaction relation stress. helpful people get sleep.
lot fun that. getting emails people said, haven't slept right
15 years, now first time, listening app can sleep night.
helpful again, wake middle night, tell people, don't
look clock. arousal cue. wake more, picture whatever
thinking worrying imaginary screen body

use get back sleep. - using self-hypnosis sleep long time.
now Reveri app, talk relationship Reveri app

raises question, found think understand correctly, one can self-
hypnosis daytime. issue comes later, like,
instance, self-hypnosis stress reduction, away stressful event prepare
one deal stress better. - Right. - hypnosis improving return sleep.
can done actually want go sleep. kind training
networks,

00:32:12 Hypnosis Strengthen Neural Connections

right? - right. - So, evidence that, brain networks actually form
stronger connections, people self-hypnosis time? - Well, rule
neurobiology know, neurons fire together wire together. - friend,
Carla Shatz. - Yes, Carla- - Not Donald Hebb, way. [David laughing] keep trying
to, widespread myth world unfortunately, internet,
that, fire together wire together said by, psychologist, Donald Hebb
Donald Hebb many important things, neurobiologist Carla Shatz- -
exactly right. - Who, Yes, Stanford also Berkeley Harvard. So, also
decent schools. - exactly right. - Stanford, said, fire together wire
together. deserves, - Right. - credit statement. Yeah,
repeated use self-hypnosis, one imagine networks getting
stronger. - think so. don't evidence yet, long term
potentiation provides pathway described program, number
times allow repeated activation network actually build new connections
work. least, even learning memory point view, memory


network associations. remember things. example like
give is, go back grade school see little tiny lockers
size wrong. suddenly flood memories obviously stored
there, just didn't think of. So, context association memory's about.
start acquire memories problem. So, one thing use hypnosis
treating phobias, example. problem people phobias, like
airplane phobias crossing bridge high, avoid
more, source associations memories fear. don't
good experiences 'cause avoid it. like get back horse fall
off kind thing. hypnosis, can start people able manage anxiety
enough can more, wider array experiences, start
network associations isn't negative may even positive. - almost
like a, sorry interrupt, ask. - Sure - almost like a, exposure therapy
done mind. - Yes. - always mind. mean, even exposure to,
snake phobia, don't, don't like snakes, don't think qualifies full
blown phobia. think healthy fear snakes. - Yeah. - if, say
snake phobia, typical approach in, be, cognitive behavioral approaches, right,
show picture snake, rubber snake, real snake.
Eventually person is, - Yeah. - holding boa constrictor something like that. -
[David] Right. - mind translate nervous system
signals. hypnosis, sounds like can give number positive experiences
without use props, without bring animals room. - Right,
I- - Drive someone across bridge, right? - Yes, woman,
successful business woman, high level corporation. terrible dog phobia.
imagine somebody brought dog room said, "what
doing?" see getting tense. said, "Well, waiting
see dog does." said, "If somebody works you, comes
office, freeze wait see did?" said, "Of course not,
tell 'em do." [laughs] said, "Well, immobilizing yourself, power
isn't dog you, so, imagine might engage dog
help control situation." said, "Thanks." reminds of, one
favorite stories hypnosis that, father seeing woman lived
Midtown Manhattan horrible dog phobia. dropped things, spill
coffee saw dog. time trips store, thought


least likely people walking dogs. - Now wouldn't possible, everyone
in- - [laughs] Everyone New York dog - like fleet French Bulldogs, -
Right, exactly. - taking New York City. - So, taught think dog
friend, neighbor dog, bring dog hold dog collar
make sure, gradually able stroke dog say, dog friend
distinguish wild tame animals. animals, afraid
[murmurs]. So, seemed better. called back three months later
asked her. "Well, calling?" son said. said, "Dr. Spiegel."
boy said, "That's weird." father said, "What's weird?" said, "Spiegel's
heat." bought dog, - love it. - named it, Spiegel. - love it. - Talk
transference. - love it. [David laughing]

00:37:19 Restructuring Trauma Narratives

really speaks power this. brings back issue. So,
different about, father case woman, terms
happened hypnosis allowed go completely terrified dogs
owning dog naming father? find amusing. - Yeah. -
different just two sitting talking it, right? know,
therapy, narrative huge component. - Right. - hypnosis narrative huge
component. - Right. - must that, brain state really different.
talk trauma minutes. think people trauma
phobias, certainly conversation it. might freeze up.
might lose articulation forth. different
state combines narrative, think allow underlying neural networks
engage change? 'Cause find fascinating a- Every attempt
dealing stress phobia clinical setting involves discussion
is. - Yes. - But, not talking medication introduced,
least not particular circumstances. - Right. - So, realize kind obvious
question like, difference brain activity, find incredible.
control variable brain state. not, spoken. - raising
couple important issues, Andrew. talked earlier systematic
desensitization, sort lay hierarchy things one time.
think unsystematic desensitization, changing mental states.


think evidence mental state change
therapeutic potential. seeing ketamine treating depression,
dissociogenic drug. know every morning wake up, problem,
know, made mistake reading nasty email 11:00 PM. didn't know
do. wake morning thinking, oh, idiot, yeah,
going do. So, just changing mental state, therapeutic potential. think
underestimate ability regulate change responses cognitively,
emotionally somatically flexible. so, things, right, follow similar
principles facing problem, seeing different point view. done
really, nice podcast trauma stress expose it,
not avoid it, talked before. find way reconnect it,
substitute something can make feel good, rather bad, activate
centers brain like mesolimbic reward system. so, hypnosis
can much faster. People don't think can can.
having, right now physical experience, thinking not feeling
bad used to. can powerful thing can hypnosis. So,
woman came see me, suffered attempted rape. getting dark,
coming back grocery store guy grabs wants get
apartment. outside apartment. starts fighting
winds basilar skull fracture. runs away. cops come, since hadn't
raped, left, weren't interested. wanted use hypnosis get
better image guy looked like, painful, upsetting thing. So,
quite hypnotizable. got floating. say, safe comfortable, now, nothing
can happen will harm body. left side screen, want
picture guy approaching happening. said, really,
light, getting dark. really can't see much facial features, recognize
something, hadn't allowed remember. gets upstairs, doesn't just
want rape me, going kill me. so, ways, seeing
even worse. So, thinking, good, Spiegel, made even frightened
before. pointed PTSD stress lecture, got
confront trauma, restructure understanding it. So, side
screen, picture, protect yourself? everybody
trauma situation engages strategy self protection. salience network
kicking in. said, "You know what?" surprised fighting hard.


didn't think would. so, realized one hand even worse
thought was. hand actually probably saved life.
so, way of, helping restructure experience trauma make
tolerable. helped her- didn't recog- couldn't identify guy,
helped restructure understand experience. something
can just talking, straight psychotherapy. sometimes can hell
lot faster efficiently using hypnosis. one randomized trial
Israel shows adding hypnosis PTSD treatment, actually improves
outcome. way accomplishing things understand broader
psychotherapy world, much quickly sometimes effectively. - Yeah,
sounds like going somewhat state one trying deal with,
dissociating state key. imagine, open
various podcasts. done lot analysis years. experienced
sessions, depending show them, might just get kind
laundry list happened opposed actually feeling anything, around
happened. - Right. - think people probably vary extent can
drop feeling states can depend day. can depend well
slept night on. - one thing might add, Andrew, - Yes. -
is, notion late Gordon Bower, just memorial Gordon
Stanford. died year ago. Brilliant cognitive psychologist, one founders
cognitive psychology Stanford great pitcher. almost became Major
League pitcher decided go grad school instead, glad did.
Gordon helped establish concept state dependent memory
certain mental state, enhance ability remember things it. sort
bad example drunk hides bottle can't remember
put gets drunk mental state. People go
dissociative states traumatized. way, hypnosis helping
remember deal memories better mental state
like happened. rape victims will tell you, floating
body, feeling sorry woman assaulted below. People traumatic
episodes, just say, know, blank out, don't know happening,
autopilot kind self hypnotic state. So, use hypnosis help
deal traumatic memory, making state in, right office
you, congruent state likely in, trauma happened.


think part helps facilitate treatment trauma related disorders. -
see.

00:45:14 Ketamine Therapy

makes ask, every question ask, 'cause really feel
almost like compulsion, dissociation traumatic episode is, part
adaptive strategy. - Right. - creates certain issues, creates problems, right?
something like ketamine, creates dissociative state, useful
treatment trauma? confused days colleague,
Karl Deisseroth, also podcast coworkers figured out,
okay, layer one networks neocortex, involved
dissociative state. starting gain understanding ketamine
works neural level. - Right. - seem, certain populations can
useful treatment. don't know, never tried it. don't know current status
is, legal. allowed least in, FDA approved use.
dissociative states useful element dissociation gave rise
trauma memory first place? - Well, yeah, Karl brilliant paper
nature he, rats humans one paper. showed
rhythmic discharge retrosplenial region, triggered ketamine.
rats actually showed dissociative like behavior, hot pad
ordinarily wouldn't didn't seem much pain paw.
male subject implanted electrodes- - Human, yeah. - human subject, yeah.
electrodes picked rhythmic activity. did,
report dissociative state. description was, like pilot
airplane. felt walking cockpit plane still flying
and- - sounds terrifying me. [David laughing] sounds terrify terrifying. -
thing- - want body, [David laughing] time, know. -
right but, point is, way principal, Andrew, like, principle said,
need re-confront traumatic situation can modulate associations
it. So, accept it, accept arousal, put boundaries around
figure can approach problem approach
problem different point view. So, not surprise- fact, studied,
people disassociated Loma Prieta earthquake Oakland-Berkeley


firestorm. - remember well. - Yeah. - Earthquakes follow me. move
south Northridge quake- - going keep away So, there'll one
later, afternoon. [David laughing] - starting dissociating. So, dissociation
compartmentalize experience, means point view treating trauma,
inhibition. don't engage it. like happened there. think
happens people, sometimes good able separate
recollection. somewhere. sight not mind.
effects you, can't deal it. can't reprocess it. think
one reason ketamine might work fact, allows keep, re-approach
dissociative experience way can start think something
it. just fact can turn off. also self-hypnosis
helpful. not something just comes happens you.
something can make happen. can control it, can something it. So,
feel less helpless control. essence trauma helplessness. not
fear, not pain. helplessness. become object. become just body.
don't control going on. not used that. discussed
breathing paper anticipation breathing. not whether breathe, inhale
exhale hold breath, think can inhale can't,
really upsetting, understandably. so, issue control hypnosis,
terrible reputation taking away control actually superb way enhancing
control mind body. - love reminds naming important.
almost wonder self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis called something
else, would've separated stage hypnosis way make
less scary, weird, complicated people embrace. But, - Yeah. - part reason
discussion is, great experiences hypnosis, seen
data, talking lot clinical examples. incredibly powerful boils
right neural brain states. - Right. - And,

00:50:07 Self-directed Hypnosis, Reveri

think years come, going become widespread along lines.
quickly, described examples people getting relief quickly. -
Right. - permanent, changes? need follow related
that, sure number people listening thinking, wonderful, love


get hypnotized number different things Dr. Spiegel somebody else expert
clinical hypnosis, might not access somebody similar
training. power? So, quickly work? long lasting
changes? then, necessary work clinical hypnotist? better
self-hypnosis forth? Maybe just give us contour
landscape directed self-directed treatment. - Well, typically, people
start coming see clinician like me. better see someone licensing
training professional discipline, medicine, psychology, dentistry, whatever. -
'Cause lot hypnotists there, just hypnotist. - Right. Just
hypnotists. - Oh, okay. - key issue is, somebody can really assess
problem make sure not, talking someone reducing chest
pain, rather getting coronary artery problem- - 'Cause real
issue there. - could, right. - hypnosis might adjust wouldn't deal
deeper underlying issue. - right. hand. typically use
people, often see twice periodically, not every week.
certainly not every day, pain problem hypnosis helpful pain.
so, is, identifying hypnotizable are. give standard
brief test ability experience hypnosis, going self-hypnosis
exercise deal problem, seeing respond it,
teaching themselves. old days, used use
iPhone record part session. play back hypnosis
experience. Now developed app, "Reveri," can teach people step
through, dealing pain, stress, focus, insomnia help people eat better
stop smoking. elements take 15 minutes elements just
take one two minutes people can refresh reinforce. - Two minute hypnosis,
[indistinct] one minute. - Yes. - Yeah. - one two, one two minutes
now, finding two thirds people find even just one minute
refresher, helps feel better. reporting, feel better. So, nice thing is,
know right away, whether likely help not. found, done
studies, looking hypnosis pain relief acute medical procedures.
randomized trial published Lancet, three conditions, people getting
arterial cutdowns chemoembolized tumors liver visualize renal artery
stenosis. don't use general anesthesia this. uncomfortable people
anxious three conditions. One standard care, push


button get opioids, IV. - surgery? - surgery. second
is, that, plus friendly nurse, comforting them. So, controlled
pleasant attention support. third was, taught self-hypnosis
pain control. So, feeling, can change temperature, body
cool, tingling, numb, floating ice water feeling comfortable. go
somewhere else, leave body go desert island enjoy yourself.
found that, two half hour procedure, hour half,
hypnosis group reduced pain 80%, compared standard, - Wow. care
group, using half amount opioids, fewer complications procedure
took 17 minutes less time average get done. not patient
relaxed. treatment staff. weren't dealing someone
struggling uncomfortable. measured anxiety thing.
hypnosis group, worried dead. no anxiety hour
half, saying, fine, know, fine. standard care
group, 5 10 anxiety scores point. So, published Lancet,
big randomized trial. drug that, every hospital country
using now, no industry push it. So, part helped us decide
needed help people, Reveri teach
provide interactive support it. it, question, although is,
work long term? 'Cause can acutely doesn't necessarily carry on. So,
around randomized trial women metastatic breast cancer.
advancing disease. met support group week taught
self-hypnosis, stress anxiety pain control end. end
year, treatment group half pain control group did, same,
low amounts medication. So, lasts. say, felt pain
chest thought metastasis, just exercise. got warm bath
felt fine. So, works becomes skill people acquire, can
tell right away, whether likely help them, working clinician now using
app ways helping learn use skill. So, nice thing will
know quickly, whether likely help not. is, can learn
yourself. - great will, again, there'll link Reveri caption,
available Apple Android. think even though nominal cost there,
think that, mentioned, medications approaches dealing
problems quite expensive, potential side effects things. Not


aren't also useful. - I, get that, - Please. - just one
thing. worked hard app. iOS app Apple. decided
table moment, redoing Android app. So, available,
working Alexa platform. not moment will soon. So, just
don't want people disappointed looking Android,
agenda don't moment.

00:56:53 Eliminating Obsessive Thoughts, Superstitions

- Great, thanks clarification. hopefully, time both, get asked lot
obsessive thoughts intrusive thoughts. also get asked lot OCD.
evidence hypnosis self-hypnosis can used for, dealing obsessive
thoughts? - Sometimes, obsessional people, just turn not
hypnotizable for, yeah, not random. tend controlling
thought, busy evaluating rather experiencing, so- - know people
like that. [David laughing] sounds like adaptive mindset lot professions. -
right. - get trained that, - Yeah. - school, obsess
exam, obsess the, - Yeah. - social interactions. mean, part
becoming functional human being. yet, can take us different- -
sometimes overdo it. mean, tell one example extreme situations, that,
know, judging, evaluating, not letting experience, including
emotionally. know somebody, listens tapes airplanes go down. So,
get black box listen it. said me, know- -
profession recreational- - No, profession. - Okay. -
did. 'Cause trying accident prevention handle things.
said worry people panicking, right? guys know
got 30 seconds 45 seconds just going
checklist. said, don't panic enough. taught do.
reason, good reason it. sometimes overdo it. painful
listen 'cause know going happen. So, kind balance
hit. sometimes get emotional absorbed not
enough sort see possibilities. can problem.
hand, sometimes rigid controlled don't let emotions guide
need protect protect others. So, say


general people OCD are, less hypnotizable side spectrum,
less likely allow engage any, typical example checking
OCD example, don't remember, whether locked door turned off
gas oven keep going back keep checking. So,
evaluative component brain, kind overrides experiential one sometimes
people can get benefit, not group select
likely respond self hypnotic approaches. - superstitions similar? -
Superstitions, think more, people hypnotizable, keep
getting caught things like superstitions there, imagination supplants
reality. seen lot happening recently. think there,
possible helped learning sort see put context, see
different point view. - developed pretty vicious superstition,
college hard break, actually. always feel, talk clinicians,
reveal certain things pathology. - Please do. - so- - get
bill later. - Thank you, yes, part reason arranged this. [David laughing] No,
just kidding. yeah, did. habit knocking wood things noticed
started to, sneak knocking wood every 'cause didn't want
people think often. started realize that, becoming
little bit reflex. saw incredible video Bence Olveczky's lab
Harvard. studies motor patterns. rats press different
sequences levers turn dials order get pellet food. that,
start introduce behaviors nothing actual lever
pressing, like start scratching hind quarters things like that. hat,
heads, excuse me, don't wear hats flipping ears. just like
pitcher throwing baseball. this, - Oh, yeah. - start incorporate
motor behaviors unrelated outcome, mind somehow starts think
necessary outcome. incorporate it. So, decided
break simply forcing not week. - Mm-hm. just
seemed like ridiculous, - [Both] thing do. Yeah, well- - Knock wood. - call
response prevention works. is, set new context
brain, get outcome want, devoid extraneous behavior. - Yeah,
knew nuts, right. knew illogical. - Right.

01:01:50 ‘Hypnotizability’, Spiegel Eye-roll Test



- somehow things take meaning. - [David] Right. - So, talked about,
utility hypnosis stress reduction, phobias, pain, possibly, don't know for,
things like ADHD OCD, just will depend hypnotizability. - Right. - talked
beautiful study the, metastatic breast cancer outcome patients.
Hypnotizability clearly key variable. - Yes. - please tell us,
hypnotizability is, evaluated Spiegel Eye-Roll Test is? - Okay,
sure. So, hypnotizability just capacity hypnotic experiences.
test called hypnotic conduction profile. give highly structured hypnotic
experience. old tradition clinical hypnosis was, try bunch
different things, talking, walking upstairs downstairs images time
say breathing subject that. change
clinician, less can make variation outcome. take
long time, know, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. just view kind complex,
not effective way assessing person's hypnotic capacity. know
peak period hypnotizability human life, latency years childhood. So,
every eight year old trance time. call 'em dinner, don't
hear ya, thing. childhood wonderful
experience. Work play thing. try make little
adults, think terrible mistake. Everything fun them. enjoy learning,
enjoy everything. - age this- - like 6 10, 6 11.
playful, enjoy everything. Everything sort game fun try
make miserable them, got it. when, Piaget called,
adult cognitive framework, learn abstract concepts, learn even one
bottle looks bigger other, can equal volume. so, imposing
logic, growing DLPFC point imposing cognitive structure
experience. people start lose hypnotic ability. time
early 20s, hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed. study done
Stanford, Ernest Hillard, Phil Zimbardo this, looking at, tracked
students psych one, hypnotizability measured retested
blindly 25 years later. test, retest correlation was, want guess
was? - guessing it's, don't know, 0.6 something. - Yeah, close. 0.7, IQ
0.6, 25 year interval. - Wow. - So, stable IQ 25
year interval. So, point, are. factors


lead that? Well, means that, third adults just
not hypnotizable. Two thirds are, 15% extremely hypnotizable can
measure give number 0 10. useful.
patients it, say, look, sorry, not hypnotizable going
something else. Medication, systematic desensitization, mindfulness, things
hypnotizable, just go it. don't lot explaining. People
low moderate hypnotizable, like explanations doing,
can still get benefits. So, helps guide nature treatment
people. Now, eye roll is, father used use eye fixation induction, used
say, look ceiling now close eyes looking up. very,
yes, very- - Yeah [indistinct] [laughs]. - noticed two patients back
back. one woman seen work with, hysterical seizures.
just suddenly start shaking. And- - Real epileptic seizures? - No, pseudo
epileptic seizures. - see, hysteria. - Hysteria, although people both,
the, people, real epilepsy becomes framework gets elaborated on,
stressed, seizures. just pseudo epilepsy, no EEG
abnormalities. really something watch. husband move
work bench near door, started seizure, run home
try help it. bad. noticed
did, looked up, one seizure events, see
sclera, don't see Iris anymore. start seize. great thing
her. taught seizures. Everybody else telling stop.
made one. hypnotized her, [indistinct] go back last time
one sure enough, start shake. gradually make smaller
smaller. So, learning control, access, like
PTSD, confront, don't avoid it, don't suppress it. confront figure
deal it. next patient rigid obsessional businessman
wanted stop controlling [chuckles], reminded me,
New Yorker cartoon driver, comes yield sign yells, "Never!"
always [indistinct]. - sounds right, New Yorker. - Yeah, New
Yorker. so, guy, tried look up, couldn't keep eyes
closed them. so, father started testing people. seemed
rough correlation capacity keep eyes up, closed
measured hypnotizability. - people listening [stutters], watching


video. So, Spiegel Eye-Roll Test, involves looking ceiling. So, tilting
head back, tilting chin back looking ceiling now. also
directing eyes upward eyes open. eye roll test involves
then, closing eyelids eyes open. - open. - whether not,
eyes roll back said it, see sclera, white part. - see sclera,
white part. - means you're, hypnotizable moderately hypnotizable. -
Right. - Whereas eyes move see iris, colored part eye
eyes close, less hypnotizable. - Right. - can look online there, just
put Spiegel Eye-Roll Test find it. also going actual
example hypnosis video later. - Right. So, asking brain something
difficult, keep eyes closing eyelids. contradictory signals
third, fourth sixth cranial nerve nuclei control eye movement. - said
third- - Fourth six, - Yup. - cranial nerve nuclei. suspending one

close eyes sleep, rapid eye movement dream.
drugs, affect level consciousness, can affect eyes eye movements,
either dilation contraction pupils, depending whether stimulant
opioid. - Stimulants, make pupils big. - Big, right? - Yeah. Like cocaine,
amphetamine. - Right, exactly. - Things sort. - opioids, get constricted
pupils. - parents looking kids coming door late night,
looking substance abuse. - right. - Yeah. - So, something
eyes lot level consciousness. mean, obviously, close
eyes go sleep, rapid eye movement dreaming.
So, not surprising. old Zen practice called, looking third eye.
think part reason happens is, looking inside like
third eye two forehead. think
visual creatures, pretty pathetic physical point view. Many animals

predator animals eyes front head, good,

makes sense. - Sure. - But, signs locations built around, people's
tendency animals tendencies. - Oh, really [indistinct]? - aggregate there. Yeah,
interesting book history national parks says, didn't
give research study support it, no Google Maps, obviously. -
interesting. - Yeah, panorama visual boundaries really interesting. think,
eyes, know, two pieces central nervous system brain,

close eyes also, going sleep. not worried going

turning inward. unusual state. Normally close eyes periodically,
to, close eyes period time, normally go


sleep not worried detecting risk threat. So, interesting state
turning inward, basically, looking up, shutting eyes
allowing whatever happens outside happen focusing
going inward. So, think signal brain turn inward. - interesting.
meditation course, done eyes open almost always done
eyes closed. - Yes, right. - interesting. So, can quickly determine
whether not someone highly hypnotizable. - Right. - not hypnotizable.
said two thirds people can hypnotized. - Right. - Obviously third cannot.
within two thirds can, range, said 15% people fall
this, highly hypnotizable category. - Right, correct. - seem member
of. - Yeah. - And, repeated use self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis, increase
change hypnotizability, can access first place? - say
general, may increase little bit, not hell lot, not worth effort
increase hypnotizability point. worth trying deal problem,
dealing with. So, can get better using level have.
study done tried train people hypnotizable
obviously, there're subjective behavioral components test, can learn
little better them. found reanalyze data,
account three times final score, based initial hypnotizability
measurement, rather whether not trained better. So,
can improve little

01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)

not worth trouble. - Got it. Along lines eyes eye movements, lot
interest EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. -
Shapiro working, wasn't Stanford directly, local
Stanford. - Yeah. - think Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - thoughts
EMDR? useful, think less useful? things
EMDR combined make useful? listeners podcast
come to, think, come podcast range backgrounds interests. me,
makes sense EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given newer
data can suppress amygdala activity animals animal models
humans well. really hasn't explored much, neurally. heard things like,


coordinates two sides brain, it, just throwaway. don't think
evidence that, coordinating two sides brain better not
coordinating. wouldn't speaking right now two sides brain, well
correlated. - Yeah. - language lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - heard
mimics, rapid eye movements sleep, actually doesn't. So, - Right. -
heard people talk positive experiences EMDR.
thoughts EMDR? - Yeah, good comment one recent
podcasts. tell you, one way sort think bemused point view,
old, mentioned earlier, oldest sort idea hypnotic induction,
dangling watch, right? [indistinct] watch. And, fact, enough concern
automobiles invented, movement prevent
installing windshield wipers people afraid hypnotized,
watched windshield wipers go back forth car. Now, turns
fortunately that, tend not look windshield wipers. keep looking
windshield. so, windshield wipers today. movement is,
exactly used hypnotic induction. think lot hypnosis EMDR. - Ah. -
think, combination exposure based treatments, use
EMDR think it. tend not process experience much just
physical part it, personally think drawback. And, every study seen
dismantling study. no question people go EMDR, many

on. every program dismantled, going treatment

anything it. toward end career, Francine [indistinct]

things. So, tend think that, EMDR another form exposure based therapy
trauma, implied exception possible new data, certainly
doesn't with, rapid eye movement sleep. don't think moving eyes
issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put
weight this, going re-injure ankle example, simply mean
body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat
something coming opportunity something ameliorate situation. So,
not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding
happening. face also say, opportunity
something it. minute realistically enha- doesn't mean,
imagine away heart attack. means figure rehabilitate heart attack


broken leg something like way get much control

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body
floating, safe comfortable. Now, picture Mary sit feeling sadness
no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,
watch it, try [stutters]. work enjoying together shows
breathing patterns may increase sympathetic arousal may decrease. may
[indistinct] cyclic sighing seems to, actually, time spent exhaling
inhaling. reason believe induces parasympathetic activity,
'cause increasing pressure chest therefore allowing heart slow
blood returned atrium easily. use it. ask people
take deep breath part induction slowly exhale. partly
result research together, emphasizing slow exhale more, part
[stutters], enhance idea induction period relaxation, 'cause
think inducing perhaps perceiving well. So, no,
absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go
automatically can control it. so, kind way us demonstrate
ourselves, greater ways modulating internal state. So, can either it,
thinking it, way pain control hypnosis can
extent, taking charge breathing things will produce change
want see happen body. So, like right margin,
can enhance, me, like way augmenting hypnosis,
medication, think powerful way that. - Great, really excited see
goes. - Yes. - Breathing, vision, bodily states clearly the-
directed mental focus, seem key elements hypnosis. missing


ingredients? - Yeah, think right. - It's- - Breathing, vision, - Breathing, vision,
change vision don't, know, typically physically relaxed
state, frankly people peak performance, including physical athletic
performance musical performance hypnotic states too. talked
classical pianists say, not thinking, start thinking fingers
now, screw up. floating piano, thinking tone want
feel exuding instrument. hypnotic like state too. many athletes
peak performance, just flowing it. not thinking step step,
doing? best working
giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much
always you. can people learn about, can get
hypnotized? mentioned Reveri, put link it, R-E-V-E-R-I.com way
access that. - Reveri app app store, way. reveri.com
website, can get download Reveri app app
store. - Great. So, currently apple, hopefully soon, also Android,
meantime, people interested exploring clinical hypnosis, working
somebody similar? centralized resource people can go find, really
well-trained hypnotists? - two good professional organizations will help
that. One society clinical experimental hypnosis. think
sceh.us their- - Okay, look provide link. - American society
clinical hypnosis, provide referral services professionals. can look
up. just say general, look someone licensed trained
primary professional discipline, psychiatry, psychology, medicine, dentistry
training interest using hypnosis, way it. - Great one
question comment. question is, will psychiatrist? - [laughs]
honored. - tall task. might stubborn patient. - think hardest
work's already done, Andrew. - Thank you. - fine, now. - appreciate that.
[David laughing] Well, final thing comment. First all, thank much
today, sharing knowledge. - welcome. - hope can
again. - hope so. - love working laboratory you. -
Likewise [indistinct]. - speak, learn know others well. -
Thank you. - will put resources get also just want say, thank


work do. - Well, thank you. - incredible thing world
discovering much body works, mind still rather
mysterious people struggling lot things, also think people
really excited about, applying tools like hypnosis perform better, feel better mentally
physically. pointed us tremendous amount resources
tools work already demonstrated work. just, thank
you. know professional commitment life benefit. So, thank
so. - Well, thank you, real joy collaborating
using precision knowledge neuroanatomy, neurobiology
address problems often people disciplined primary
neurobiological end, aren't interested are. so, really pleasure
try bring together know different perspectives build
something neither us alone. so, real joy it. -

networks,

00:32:12 Hypnosis Strengthen Neural Connections

right? - right. - So, evidence that, brain networks actually form
stronger connections, people self-hypnosis time? - Well, rule
neurobiology know, neurons fire together wire together. - friend,
Carla Shatz. - Yes, Carla- - Not Donald Hebb, way. [David laughing] keep trying
to, widespread myth world unfortunately, internet,
that, fire together wire together said by, psychologist, Donald Hebb
Donald Hebb many important things, neurobiologist Carla Shatz- -
exactly right. - Who, Yes, Stanford also Berkeley Harvard. So, also
decent schools. - exactly right. - Stanford, said, fire together wire
together. deserves, - Right. - credit statement. Yeah,
repeated use self-hypnosis, one imagine networks getting
stronger. - think so. don't evidence yet, long term
potentiation provides pathway described program, number
times allow repeated activation network actually build new connections
work. least, even learning memory point view, memory


network associations. remember things. example like
give is, go back grade school see little tiny lockers
size wrong. suddenly flood memories obviously stored
there, just didn't think of. So, context association memory's about.
start acquire memories problem. So, one thing use hypnosis
treating phobias, example. problem people phobias, like
airplane phobias crossing bridge high, avoid
more, source associations memories fear. don't
good experiences 'cause avoid it. like get back horse fall
off kind thing. hypnosis, can start people able manage anxiety
enough can more, wider array experiences, start
network associations isn't negative may even positive. - almost
like a, sorry interrupt, ask. - Sure - almost like a, exposure therapy

snake phobia, don't, don't like snakes, don't think qualifies full

talk trauma minutes. think people trauma
phobias, certainly conversation it. might freeze up.
might lose articulation forth. different
state combines narrative, think allow underlying neural networks
engage change? 'Cause find fascinating a- Every attempt
dealing stress phobia clinical setting involves discussion
is. - Yes. - But, not talking medication introduced,
least not particular circumstances. - Right. - So, realize kind obvious
question like, difference brain activity, find incredible.
control variable brain state. not, spoken. - raising
couple important issues, Andrew. talked earlier systematic
desensitization, sort lay hierarchy things one time.
think unsystematic desensitization, changing mental states.


think evidence mental state change
therapeutic potential. seeing ketamine treating depression,
dissociogenic drug. know every morning wake up, problem,
know, made mistake reading nasty email 11:00 PM. didn't know
do. wake morning thinking, oh, idiot, yeah,
going do. So, just changing mental state, therapeutic potential. think
underestimate ability regulate change responses cognitively,
emotionally somatically flexible. so, things, right, follow similar
principles facing problem, seeing different point view. done
really, nice podcast trauma stress expose it,
not avoid it, talked before. find way reconnect it,
substitute something can make feel good, rather bad, activate
centers brain like mesolimbic reward system. so, hypnosis
can much faster. People don't think can can.
having, right now physical experience, thinking not feeling
bad used to. can powerful thing can hypnosis. So,
woman came see me, suffered attempted rape. getting dark,
coming back grocery store guy grabs wants get
apartment. outside apartment. starts fighting
winds basilar skull fracture. runs away. cops come, since hadn't
raped, left, weren't interested. wanted use hypnosis get
better image guy looked like, painful, upsetting thing. So,
quite hypnotizable. got floating. say, safe comfortable, now, nothing
can happen will harm body. left side screen, want
picture guy approaching happening. said, really,
light, getting dark. really can't see much facial features, recognize
something, hadn't allowed remember. gets upstairs, doesn't just
want rape me, going kill me. so, ways, seeing
even worse. So, thinking, good, Spiegel, made even frightened
before. pointed PTSD stress lecture, got
confront trauma, restructure understanding it. So, side
screen, picture, protect yourself? everybody
trauma situation engages strategy self protection. salience network
kicking in. said, "You know what?" surprised fighting hard.


didn't think would. so, realized one hand even worse
thought was. hand actually probably saved life.
so, way of, helping restructure experience trauma make
tolerable. helped her- didn't recog- couldn't identify guy,
helped restructure understand experience. something
can just talking, straight psychotherapy. sometimes can hell
lot faster efficiently using hypnosis. one randomized trial
Israel shows adding hypnosis PTSD treatment, actually improves
outcome. way accomplishing things understand broader
psychotherapy world, much quickly sometimes effectively. - Yeah,
sounds like going somewhat state one trying deal with,
dissociating state key. imagine, open
various podcasts. done lot analysis years. experienced
sessions, depending show them, might just get kind
laundry list happened opposed actually feeling anything, around
happened. - Right. - think people probably vary extent can
drop feeling states can depend day. can depend well
slept night on. - one thing might add, Andrew, - Yes. -
is, notion late Gordon Bower, just memorial Gordon
Stanford. died year ago. Brilliant cognitive psychologist, one founders
cognitive psychology Stanford great pitcher. almost became Major
League pitcher decided go grad school instead, glad did.
Gordon helped establish concept state dependent memory
certain mental state, enhance ability remember things it. sort
bad example drunk hides bottle can't remember
put gets drunk mental state. People go
dissociative states traumatized. way, hypnosis helping
remember deal memories better mental state
like happened. rape victims will tell you, floating
body, feeling sorry woman assaulted below. People traumatic
episodes, just say, know, blank out, don't know happening,
autopilot kind self hypnotic state. So, use hypnosis help
deal traumatic memory, making state in, right office
you, congruent state likely in, trauma happened.


think part helps facilitate treatment trauma related disorders. -
see.

00:45:14 Ketamine Therapy

makes ask, every question ask, 'cause really feel
almost like compulsion, dissociation traumatic episode is, part
adaptive strategy. - Right. - creates certain issues, creates problems, right?
something like ketamine, creates dissociative state, useful
treatment trauma? confused days colleague,
Karl Deisseroth, also podcast coworkers figured out,
okay, layer one networks neocortex, involved
dissociative state. starting gain understanding ketamine
works neural level. - Right. - seem, certain populations can
useful treatment. don't know, never tried it. don't know current status
is, legal. allowed least in, FDA approved use.
dissociative states useful element dissociation gave rise
trauma memory first place? - Well, yeah, Karl brilliant paper
nature he, rats humans one paper. showed
rhythmic discharge retrosplenial region, triggered ketamine.
rats actually showed dissociative like behavior, hot pad
ordinarily wouldn't didn't seem much pain paw.
male subject implanted electrodes- - Human, yeah. - human subject, yeah.
electrodes picked rhythmic activity. did,
report dissociative state. description was, like pilot
airplane. felt walking cockpit plane still flying
and- - sounds terrifying me. [David laughing] sounds terrify terrifying. -
thing- - want body, [David laughing] time, know. -
right but, point is, way principal, Andrew, like, principle said,
need re-confront traumatic situation can modulate associations
it. So, accept it, accept arousal, put boundaries around
figure can approach problem approach
problem different point view. So, not surprise- fact, studied,
people disassociated Loma Prieta earthquake Oakland-Berkeley


firestorm. - remember well. - Yeah. - Earthquakes follow me. move
south Northridge quake- - going keep away So, there'll one
later, afternoon. [David laughing] - starting dissociating. So, dissociation
compartmentalize experience, means point view treating trauma,
inhibition. don't engage it. like happened there. think
happens people, sometimes good able separate
recollection. somewhere. sight not mind.
effects you, can't deal it. can't reprocess it. think
one reason ketamine might work fact, allows keep, re-approach
dissociative experience way can start think something
it. just fact can turn off. also self-hypnosis
helpful. not something just comes happens you.
something can make happen. can control it, can something it. So,
feel less helpless control. essence trauma helplessness. not
fear, not pain. helplessness. become object. become just body.
don't control going on. not used that. discussed
breathing paper anticipation breathing. not whether breathe, inhale
exhale hold breath, think can inhale can't,
really upsetting, understandably. so, issue control hypnosis,
terrible reputation taking away control actually superb way enhancing
control mind body. - love reminds naming important.
almost wonder self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis called something
else, would've separated stage hypnosis way make
less scary, weird, complicated people embrace. But, - Yeah. - part reason
discussion is, great experiences hypnosis, seen
data, talking lot clinical examples. incredibly powerful boils
right neural brain states. - Right. - And,

00:50:07 Self-directed Hypnosis, Reveri

think years come, going become widespread along lines.
quickly, described examples people getting relief quickly. -
Right. - permanent, changes? need follow related
that, sure number people listening thinking, wonderful, love


get hypnotized number different things Dr. Spiegel somebody else expert
clinical hypnosis, might not access somebody similar
training. power? So, quickly work? long lasting
changes? then, necessary work clinical hypnotist? better
self-hypnosis forth? Maybe just give us contour
landscape directed self-directed treatment. - Well, typically, people
start coming see clinician like me. better see someone licensing
training professional discipline, medicine, psychology, dentistry, whatever. -
'Cause lot hypnotists there, just hypnotist. - Right. Just
hypnotists. - Oh, okay. - key issue is, somebody can really assess
problem make sure not, talking someone reducing chest
pain, rather getting coronary artery problem- - 'Cause real
issue there. - could, right. - hypnosis might adjust wouldn't deal
deeper underlying issue. - right. hand. typically use
people, often see twice periodically, not every week.
certainly not every day, pain problem hypnosis helpful pain.
so, is, identifying hypnotizable are. give standard
brief test ability experience hypnosis, going self-hypnosis
exercise deal problem, seeing respond it,
teaching themselves. old days, used use
iPhone record part session. play back hypnosis
experience. Now developed app, "Reveri," can teach people step
through, dealing pain, stress, focus, insomnia help people eat better
stop smoking. elements take 15 minutes elements just
take one two minutes people can refresh reinforce. - Two minute hypnosis,
[indistinct] one minute. - Yes. - Yeah. - one two, one two minutes
now, finding two thirds people find even just one minute
refresher, helps feel better. reporting, feel better. So, nice thing is,
know right away, whether likely help not. found, done
studies, looking hypnosis pain relief acute medical procedures.
randomized trial published Lancet, three conditions, people getting
arterial cutdowns chemoembolized tumors liver visualize renal artery
stenosis. don't use general anesthesia this. uncomfortable people
anxious three conditions. One standard care, push


button get opioids, IV. - surgery? - surgery. second
is, that, plus friendly nurse, comforting them. So, controlled
pleasant attention support. third was, taught self-hypnosis
pain control. So, feeling, can change temperature, body
cool, tingling, numb, floating ice water feeling comfortable. go
somewhere else, leave body go desert island enjoy yourself.
found that, two half hour procedure, hour half,
hypnosis group reduced pain 80%, compared standard, - Wow. care
group, using half amount opioids, fewer complications procedure
took 17 minutes less time average get done. not patient
relaxed. treatment staff. weren't dealing someone
struggling uncomfortable. measured anxiety thing.
hypnosis group, worried dead. no anxiety hour
half, saying, fine, know, fine. standard care
group, 5 10 anxiety scores point. So, published Lancet,
big randomized trial. drug that, every hospital country
using now, no industry push it. So, part helped us decide
needed help people, Reveri teach
provide interactive support it. it, question, although is,
work long term? 'Cause can acutely doesn't necessarily carry on. So,
around randomized trial women metastatic breast cancer.
advancing disease. met support group week taught
self-hypnosis, stress anxiety pain control end. end
year, treatment group half pain control group did, same,
low amounts medication. So, lasts. say, felt pain
chest thought metastasis, just exercise. got warm bath
felt fine. So, works becomes skill people acquire, can
tell right away, whether likely help them, working clinician now using
app ways helping learn use skill. So, nice thing will
know quickly, whether likely help not. is, can learn
yourself. - great will, again, there'll link Reveri caption,
available Apple Android. think even though nominal cost there,
think that, mentioned, medications approaches dealing
problems quite expensive, potential side effects things. Not


aren't also useful. - I, get that, - Please. - just one
thing. worked hard app. iOS app Apple. decided
table moment, redoing Android app. So, available,
working Alexa platform. not moment will soon. So, just
don't want people disappointed looking Android,
agenda don't moment.

00:56:53 Eliminating Obsessive Thoughts, Superstitions

- Great, thanks clarification. hopefully, time both, get asked lot
obsessive thoughts intrusive thoughts. also get asked lot OCD.
evidence hypnosis self-hypnosis can used for, dealing obsessive
thoughts? - Sometimes, obsessional people, just turn not
hypnotizable for, yeah, not random. tend controlling
thought, busy evaluating rather experiencing, so- - know people
like that. [David laughing] sounds like adaptive mindset lot professions. -
right. - get trained that, - Yeah. - school, obsess
exam, obsess the, - Yeah. - social interactions. mean, part
becoming functional human being. yet, can take us different- -
sometimes overdo it. mean, tell one example extreme situations, that,
know, judging, evaluating, not letting experience, including
emotionally. know somebody, listens tapes airplanes go down. So,
get black box listen it. said me, know- -
profession recreational- - No, profession. - Okay. -
did. 'Cause trying accident prevention handle things.
said worry people panicking, right? guys know
got 30 seconds 45 seconds just going
checklist. said, don't panic enough. taught do.
reason, good reason it. sometimes overdo it. painful
listen 'cause know going happen. So, kind balance
hit. sometimes get emotional absorbed not
enough sort see possibilities. can problem.
hand, sometimes rigid controlled don't let emotions guide
need protect protect others. So, say


general people OCD are, less hypnotizable side spectrum,
less likely allow engage any, typical example checking
OCD example, don't remember, whether locked door turned off
gas oven keep going back keep checking. So,
evaluative component brain, kind overrides experiential one sometimes
people can get benefit, not group select
likely respond self hypnotic approaches. - superstitions similar? -
Superstitions, think more, people hypnotizable, keep
getting caught things like superstitions there, imagination supplants
reality. seen lot happening recently. think there,
possible helped learning sort see put context, see
different point view. - developed pretty vicious superstition,
college hard break, actually. always feel, talk clinicians,
reveal certain things pathology. - Please do. - so- - get
bill later. - Thank you, yes, part reason arranged this. [David laughing] No,
just kidding. yeah, did. habit knocking wood things noticed
started to, sneak knocking wood every 'cause didn't want
people think often. started realize that, becoming
little bit reflex. saw incredible video Bence Olveczky's lab
Harvard. studies motor patterns. rats press different
sequences levers turn dials order get pellet food. that,
start introduce behaviors nothing actual lever
pressing, like start scratching hind quarters things like that. hat,
heads, excuse me, don't wear hats flipping ears. just like
pitcher throwing baseball. this, - Oh, yeah. - start incorporate
motor behaviors unrelated outcome, mind somehow starts think
necessary outcome. incorporate it. So, decided
break simply forcing not week. - Mm-hm. just
seemed like ridiculous, - [Both] thing do. Yeah, well- - Knock wood. - call
response prevention works. is, set new context
brain, get outcome want, devoid extraneous behavior. - Yeah,
knew nuts, right. knew illogical. - Right.

01:01:50 ‘Hypnotizability’, Spiegel Eye-roll Test



- somehow things take meaning. - [David] Right. - So, talked about,
utility hypnosis stress reduction, phobias, pain, possibly, don't know for,
things like ADHD OCD, just will depend hypnotizability. - Right. - talked
beautiful study the, metastatic breast cancer outcome patients.
Hypnotizability clearly key variable. - Yes. - please tell us,
hypnotizability is, evaluated Spiegel Eye-Roll Test is? - Okay,
sure. So, hypnotizability just capacity hypnotic experiences.
test called hypnotic conduction profile. give highly structured hypnotic
experience. old tradition clinical hypnosis was, try bunch
different things, talking, walking upstairs downstairs images time
say breathing subject that. change
clinician, less can make variation outcome. take
long time, know, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. just view kind complex,
not effective way assessing person's hypnotic capacity. know
peak period hypnotizability human life, latency years childhood. So,
every eight year old trance time. call 'em dinner, don't
hear ya, thing. childhood wonderful
experience. Work play thing. try make little
adults, think terrible mistake. Everything fun them. enjoy learning,
enjoy everything. - age this- - like 6 10, 6 11.
playful, enjoy everything. Everything sort game fun try
make miserable them, got it. when, Piaget called,
adult cognitive framework, learn abstract concepts, learn even one
bottle looks bigger other, can equal volume. so, imposing
logic, growing DLPFC point imposing cognitive structure
experience. people start lose hypnotic ability. time
early 20s, hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed. study done
Stanford, Ernest Hillard, Phil Zimbardo this, looking at, tracked
students psych one, hypnotizability measured retested
blindly 25 years later. test, retest correlation was, want guess
was? - guessing it's, don't know, 0.6 something. - Yeah, close. 0.7, IQ
0.6, 25 year interval. - Wow. - So, stable IQ 25
year interval. So, point, are. factors


lead that? Well, means that, third adults just
not hypnotizable. Two thirds are, 15% extremely hypnotizable can
measure give number 0 10. useful.
patients it, say, look, sorry, not hypnotizable going
something else. Medication, systematic desensitization, mindfulness, things
hypnotizable, just go it. don't lot explaining. People
low moderate hypnotizable, like explanations doing,
can still get benefits. So, helps guide nature treatment
people. Now, eye roll is, father used use eye fixation induction, used
say, look ceiling now close eyes looking up. very,
yes, very- - Yeah [indistinct] [laughs]. - noticed two patients back
back. one woman seen work with, hysterical seizures.
just suddenly start shaking. And- - Real epileptic seizures? - No, pseudo
epileptic seizures. - see, hysteria. - Hysteria, although people both,
the, people, real epilepsy becomes framework gets elaborated on,
stressed, seizures. just pseudo epilepsy, no EEG
abnormalities. really something watch. husband move
work bench near door, started seizure, run home
try help it. bad. noticed
did, looked up, one seizure events, see
sclera, don't see Iris anymore. start seize. great thing
her. taught seizures. Everybody else telling stop.
made one. hypnotized her, [indistinct] go back last time
one sure enough, start shake. gradually make smaller
smaller. So, learning control, access, like
PTSD, confront, don't avoid it, don't suppress it. confront figure
deal it. next patient rigid obsessional businessman
wanted stop controlling [chuckles], reminded me,
New Yorker cartoon driver, comes yield sign yells, "Never!"
always [indistinct]. - sounds right, New Yorker. - Yeah, New
Yorker. so, guy, tried look up, couldn't keep eyes
closed them. so, father started testing people. seemed
rough correlation capacity keep eyes up, closed
measured hypnotizability. - people listening [stutters], watching


video. So, Spiegel Eye-Roll Test, involves looking ceiling. So, tilting
head back, tilting chin back looking ceiling now. also
directing eyes upward eyes open. eye roll test involves
then, closing eyelids eyes open. - open. - whether not,
eyes roll back said it, see sclera, white part. - see sclera,
white part. - means you're, hypnotizable moderately hypnotizable. -
Right. - Whereas eyes move see iris, colored part eye
eyes close, less hypnotizable. - Right. - can look online there, just
put Spiegel Eye-Roll Test find it. also going actual
example hypnosis video later. - Right. So, asking brain something
difficult, keep eyes closing eyelids. contradictory signals
third, fourth sixth cranial nerve nuclei control eye movement. - said
third- - Fourth six, - Yup. - cranial nerve nuclei. suspending one
activity, asking another eye movements lot levels
consciousness. periaqueductal gray, surrounds cranial nerve nuclei.
close eyes sleep, rapid eye movement dream.
drugs, affect level consciousness, can affect eyes eye movements,
either dilation contraction pupils, depending whether stimulant
opioid. - Stimulants, make pupils big. - Big, right? - Yeah. Like cocaine,
amphetamine. - Right, exactly. - Things sort. - opioids, get constricted
pupils. - parents looking kids coming door late night,
looking substance abuse. - right. - Yeah. - So, something
eyes lot level consciousness. mean, obviously, close
eyes go sleep, rapid eye movement dreaming.
So, not surprising. old Zen practice called, looking third eye.
think part reason happens is, looking inside like
third eye two forehead. think
visual creatures, pretty pathetic physical point view. Many animals
can outrun us, outs smell us eagles read newsprint hundred yards
can't. So, major defensive sensory input vision. animals,
predator animals eyes front head, good,
detailed vision prey. Whereas prey animals like deer, eyes side
head. So, don't see things well, much bigger range potential
see threat. mainly use, fact, interesting, social


anthropologists say, gather do, coastlines edge
forest something, got protection back. Something can
attack one side big vision might threaten you.
tend attracted kinds physical situations, so- - Yeah, love vistas. -
love vistas, right. - Vistas calming. take us panoramic
vision. - right. - didn't know this, turns scenic spots
location national parks people naturally aggregated was-
makes sense. - Sure. - But, signs locations built around, people's
tendency animals tendencies. - Oh, really [indistinct]? - aggregate there. Yeah,
interesting book history national parks says, didn't
give research study support it, no Google Maps, obviously. -
interesting. - Yeah, panorama visual boundaries really interesting. think,
eyes, know, two pieces central nervous system brain,
outside the- - Right. used say eyes outside skull neuro-
ophthalmologist wrote vehemently pointed outside
cranial vault, so, know. outside cranial vault two pieces
brain there. so, mentioned cranial nerves, three, four six.
isn't neuroanatomy course maybe go little deeper there. So, said
contradictory activity, looking controlled one set cranial nerves.
closing eyelids, controlled another cranial nerve. - No,
one. think six close eyes, activate, no, facial,
guess facial nerve. 7, yeah. - 7, yeah. - looking up, activating
muscles force eyes look up. closing eyelids normally relaxes
those, relaxes upper movement, eyes closed don't
need it. breaking usual customary pattern. - like rubbing the, -
Right. - hey, can't even it, see like the, - Right. [Andrew David laughing] -
exactly right. - Rubbing tummy patting head. bit
conflict there, - Right. - clinically, good probe you, - has. -
father. So, Spiegel senior Spiegel junior? - Spiegel senior. -
developed Spiegel Eye-Roll Test. - key issue this, normally
close eyes also, going sleep. not worried going
world anymore. Here, maintaining resting alertness. So, focusing
turning inward. unusual state. Normally close eyes periodically,
to, close eyes period time, normally go


sleep not worried detecting risk threat. So, interesting state
turning inward, basically, looking up, shutting eyes
allowing whatever happens outside happen focusing
going inward. So, think signal brain turn inward. - interesting.
meditation course, done eyes open almost always done
eyes closed. - Yes, right. - interesting. So, can quickly determine
whether not someone highly hypnotizable. - Right. - not hypnotizable.
said two thirds people can hypnotized. - Right. - Obviously third cannot.
within two thirds can, range, said 15% people fall
this, highly hypnotizable category. - Right, correct. - seem member
of. - Yeah. - And, repeated use self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis, increase
change hypnotizability, can access first place? - say
general, may increase little bit, not hell lot, not worth effort
increase hypnotizability point. worth trying deal problem,
dealing with. So, can get better using level have.
study done tried train people hypnotizable
obviously, there're subjective behavioral components test, can learn
little better them. found reanalyze data,
account three times final score, based initial hypnotizability
measurement, rather whether not trained better. So,
can improve little

01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)

not worth trouble. - Got it. Along lines eyes eye movements, lot
interest EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. -
Shapiro working, wasn't Stanford directly, local
Stanford. - Yeah. - think Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - thoughts
EMDR? useful, think less useful? things
EMDR combined make useful? listeners podcast
come to, think, come podcast range backgrounds interests. me,
makes sense EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given newer
data can suppress amygdala activity animals animal models
humans well. really hasn't explored much, neurally. heard things like,


coordinates two sides brain, it, just throwaway. don't think
evidence that, coordinating two sides brain better not
coordinating. wouldn't speaking right now two sides brain, well
correlated. - Yeah. - language lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - heard
mimics, rapid eye movements sleep, actually doesn't. So, - Right. -
heard people talk positive experiences EMDR.
thoughts EMDR? - Yeah, good comment one recent
podcasts. tell you, one way sort think bemused point view,
old, mentioned earlier, oldest sort idea hypnotic induction,
dangling watch, right? [indistinct] watch. And, fact, enough concern
automobiles invented, movement prevent
installing windshield wipers people afraid hypnotized,
watched windshield wipers go back forth car. Now, turns
fortunately that, tend not look windshield wipers. keep looking
windshield. so, windshield wipers today. movement is,
exactly used hypnotic induction. think lot hypnosis EMDR. - Ah. -
think, combination exposure based treatments, use
EMDR think it. tend not process experience much just
physical part it, personally think drawback. And, every study seen
dismantling study. no question people go EMDR, many
get better trauma related problems VA big program using
on. every program dismantled, going treatment
lateral eye movement, shown lateral eye movement, doesn't add
anything it. toward end career, Francine [indistinct]
contralateral touching something, wasn't eye movements anymore.
things. So, tend think that, EMDR another form exposure based therapy
trauma, implied exception possible new data, certainly
doesn't with, rapid eye movement sleep. don't think moving eyes
issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control

well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply

Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials

making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced

emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.

try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,

real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,
watch it, try [stutters]. work enjoying together shows
breathing patterns may increase sympathetic arousal may decrease. may
[indistinct] cyclic sighing seems to, actually, time spent exhaling

'cause increasing pressure chest therefore allowing heart slow
blood returned atrium easily. use it. ask people
take deep breath part induction slowly exhale. partly
result research together, emphasizing slow exhale more, part
[stutters], enhance idea induction period relaxation, 'cause
think inducing perhaps perceiving well. So, no,
absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go
automatically can control it. so, kind way us demonstrate
ourselves, greater ways modulating internal state. So, can either it,
thinking it, way pain control hypnosis can

want see happen body. So, like right margin,
can enhance, me, like way augmenting hypnosis,
medication, think powerful way that. - Great, really excited see

directed mental focus, seem key elements hypnosis. missing


ingredients? - Yeah, think right. - It's- - Breathing, vision, - Breathing, vision,
change vision don't, know, typically physically relaxed

classical pianists say, not thinking, start thinking fingers
now, screw up. floating piano, thinking tone want
feel exuding instrument. hypnotic like state too. many athletes
peak performance, just flowing it. not thinking step step,
doing? best working
giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much
always you. can people learn about, can get

there, just didn't think of. So, context association memory's about.
start acquire memories problem. So, one thing use hypnosis
treating phobias, example. problem people phobias, like
airplane phobias crossing bridge high, avoid

snake phobia, don't, don't like snakes, don't think qualifies full
blown phobia. think healthy fear snakes. - Yeah. - if, say
snake phobia, typical approach in, be, cognitive behavioral approaches, right,
show picture snake, rubber snake, real snake.
Eventually person is, - Yeah. - holding boa constrictor something like that. -
[David] Right. - mind translate nervous system
signals. hypnosis, sounds like can give number positive experiences
without use props, without bring animals room. - Right,
I- - Drive someone across bridge, right? - Yes, woman,
successful business woman, high level corporation. terrible dog phobia.
imagine somebody brought dog room said, "what
doing?" see getting tense. said, "Well, waiting
see dog does." said, "If somebody works you, comes
office, freeze wait see did?" said, "Of course not,
tell 'em do." [laughs] said, "Well, immobilizing yourself, power
isn't dog you, so, imagine might engage dog
help control situation." said, "Thanks." reminds of, one
favorite stories hypnosis that, father seeing woman lived
Midtown Manhattan horrible dog phobia. dropped things, spill
coffee saw dog. time trips store, thought


least likely people walking dogs. - Now wouldn't possible, everyone
in- - [laughs] Everyone New York dog - like fleet French Bulldogs, -
Right, exactly. - taking New York City. - So, taught think dog

00:37:19 Restructuring Trauma Narratives

really speaks power this. brings back issue. So,
different about, father case woman, terms
happened hypnosis allowed go completely terrified dogs
owning dog naming father? find amusing. - Yeah. -
different just two sitting talking it, right? know,
therapy, narrative huge component. - Right. - hypnosis narrative huge
component. - Right. - must that, brain state really different.
talk trauma minutes. think people trauma
phobias, certainly conversation it. might freeze up.
might lose articulation forth. different
state combines narrative, think allow underlying neural networks
engage change? 'Cause find fascinating a- Every attempt
dealing stress phobia clinical setting involves discussion
is. - Yes. - But, not talking medication introduced,
least not particular circumstances. - Right. - So, realize kind obvious
question like, difference brain activity, find incredible.
control variable brain state. not, spoken. - raising
couple important issues, Andrew. talked earlier systematic
desensitization, sort lay hierarchy things one time.
think unsystematic desensitization, changing mental states.


think evidence mental state change
therapeutic potential. seeing ketamine treating depression,
dissociogenic drug. know every morning wake up, problem,
know, made mistake reading nasty email 11:00 PM. didn't know
do. wake morning thinking, oh, idiot, yeah,
going do. So, just changing mental state, therapeutic potential. think
underestimate ability regulate change responses cognitively,
emotionally somatically flexible. so, things, right, follow similar
principles facing problem, seeing different point view. done
really, nice podcast trauma stress expose it,
not avoid it, talked before. find way reconnect it,
substitute something can make feel good, rather bad, activate
centers brain like mesolimbic reward system. so, hypnosis
can much faster. People don't think can can.
having, right now physical experience, thinking not feeling
bad used to. can powerful thing can hypnosis. So,
woman came see me, suffered attempted rape. getting dark,
coming back grocery store guy grabs wants get
apartment. outside apartment. starts fighting
winds basilar skull fracture. runs away. cops come, since hadn't
raped, left, weren't interested. wanted use hypnosis get
better image guy looked like, painful, upsetting thing. So,
quite hypnotizable. got floating. say, safe comfortable, now, nothing
can happen will harm body. left side screen, want
picture guy approaching happening. said, really,
light, getting dark. really can't see much facial features, recognize
something, hadn't allowed remember. gets upstairs, doesn't just
want rape me, going kill me. so, ways, seeing
even worse. So, thinking, good, Spiegel, made even frightened
before. pointed PTSD stress lecture, got
confront trauma, restructure understanding it. So, side
screen, picture, protect yourself? everybody
trauma situation engages strategy self protection. salience network
kicking in. said, "You know what?" surprised fighting hard.


didn't think would. so, realized one hand even worse
thought was. hand actually probably saved life.
so, way of, helping restructure experience trauma make
tolerable. helped her- didn't recog- couldn't identify guy,
helped restructure understand experience. something
can just talking, straight psychotherapy. sometimes can hell
lot faster efficiently using hypnosis. one randomized trial
Israel shows adding hypnosis PTSD treatment, actually improves
outcome. way accomplishing things understand broader
psychotherapy world, much quickly sometimes effectively. - Yeah,
sounds like going somewhat state one trying deal with,
dissociating state key. imagine, open
various podcasts. done lot analysis years. experienced
sessions, depending show them, might just get kind
laundry list happened opposed actually feeling anything, around
happened. - Right. - think people probably vary extent can
drop feeling states can depend day. can depend well
slept night on. - one thing might add, Andrew, - Yes. -
is, notion late Gordon Bower, just memorial Gordon
Stanford. died year ago. Brilliant cognitive psychologist, one founders
cognitive psychology Stanford great pitcher. almost became Major
League pitcher decided go grad school instead, glad did.
Gordon helped establish concept state dependent memory
certain mental state, enhance ability remember things it. sort
bad example drunk hides bottle can't remember
put gets drunk mental state. People go
dissociative states traumatized. way, hypnosis helping
remember deal memories better mental state
like happened. rape victims will tell you, floating
body, feeling sorry woman assaulted below. People traumatic
episodes, just say, know, blank out, don't know happening,
autopilot kind self hypnotic state. So, use hypnosis help
deal traumatic memory, making state in, right office
you, congruent state likely in, trauma happened.


think part helps facilitate treatment trauma related disorders. -
see.

00:45:14 Ketamine Therapy

makes ask, every question ask, 'cause really feel
almost like compulsion, dissociation traumatic episode is, part
adaptive strategy. - Right. - creates certain issues, creates problems, right?
something like ketamine, creates dissociative state, useful
treatment trauma? confused days colleague,
Karl Deisseroth, also podcast coworkers figured out,
okay, layer one networks neocortex, involved
dissociative state. starting gain understanding ketamine
works neural level. - Right. - seem, certain populations can
useful treatment. don't know, never tried it. don't know current status
is, legal. allowed least in, FDA approved use.
dissociative states useful element dissociation gave rise
trauma memory first place? - Well, yeah, Karl brilliant paper
nature he, rats humans one paper. showed
rhythmic discharge retrosplenial region, triggered ketamine.
rats actually showed dissociative like behavior, hot pad
ordinarily wouldn't didn't seem much pain paw.
male subject implanted electrodes- - Human, yeah. - human subject, yeah.
electrodes picked rhythmic activity. did,
report dissociative state. description was, like pilot
airplane. felt walking cockpit plane still flying
and- - sounds terrifying me. [David laughing] sounds terrify terrifying. -
thing- - want body, [David laughing] time, know. -
right but, point is, way principal, Andrew, like, principle said,
need re-confront traumatic situation can modulate associations
it. So, accept it, accept arousal, put boundaries around
figure can approach problem approach
problem different point view. So, not surprise- fact, studied,
people disassociated Loma Prieta earthquake Oakland-Berkeley


firestorm. - remember well. - Yeah. - Earthquakes follow me. move
south Northridge quake- - going keep away So, there'll one
later, afternoon. [David laughing] - starting dissociating. So, dissociation
compartmentalize experience, means point view treating trauma,
inhibition. don't engage it. like happened there. think
happens people, sometimes good able separate
recollection. somewhere. sight not mind.
effects you, can't deal it. can't reprocess it. think
one reason ketamine might work fact, allows keep, re-approach
dissociative experience way can start think something
it. just fact can turn off. also self-hypnosis
helpful. not something just comes happens you.
something can make happen. can control it, can something it. So,
feel less helpless control. essence trauma helplessness. not
fear, not pain. helplessness. become object. become just body.
don't control going on. not used that. discussed
breathing paper anticipation breathing. not whether breathe, inhale
exhale hold breath, think can inhale can't,
really upsetting, understandably. so, issue control hypnosis,
terrible reputation taking away control actually superb way enhancing
control mind body. - love reminds naming important.
almost wonder self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis called something
else, would've separated stage hypnosis way make
less scary, weird, complicated people embrace. But, - Yeah. - part reason
discussion is, great experiences hypnosis, seen
data, talking lot clinical examples. incredibly powerful boils
right neural brain states. - Right. - And,

00:50:07 Self-directed Hypnosis, Reveri

think years come, going become widespread along lines.
quickly, described examples people getting relief quickly. -
Right. - permanent, changes? need follow related
that, sure number people listening thinking, wonderful, love


get hypnotized number different things Dr. Spiegel somebody else expert
clinical hypnosis, might not access somebody similar
training. power? So, quickly work? long lasting
changes? then, necessary work clinical hypnotist? better
self-hypnosis forth? Maybe just give us contour
landscape directed self-directed treatment. - Well, typically, people
start coming see clinician like me. better see someone licensing
training professional discipline, medicine, psychology, dentistry, whatever. -
'Cause lot hypnotists there, just hypnotist. - Right. Just
hypnotists. - Oh, okay. - key issue is, somebody can really assess
problem make sure not, talking someone reducing chest
pain, rather getting coronary artery problem- - 'Cause real
issue there. - could, right. - hypnosis might adjust wouldn't deal
deeper underlying issue. - right. hand. typically use
people, often see twice periodically, not every week.
certainly not every day, pain problem hypnosis helpful pain.
so, is, identifying hypnotizable are. give standard
brief test ability experience hypnosis, going self-hypnosis
exercise deal problem, seeing respond it,
teaching themselves. old days, used use
iPhone record part session. play back hypnosis
experience. Now developed app, "Reveri," can teach people step
through, dealing pain, stress, focus, insomnia help people eat better
stop smoking. elements take 15 minutes elements just
take one two minutes people can refresh reinforce. - Two minute hypnosis,
[indistinct] one minute. - Yes. - Yeah. - one two, one two minutes
now, finding two thirds people find even just one minute
refresher, helps feel better. reporting, feel better. So, nice thing is,
know right away, whether likely help not. found, done
studies, looking hypnosis pain relief acute medical procedures.
randomized trial published Lancet, three conditions, people getting
arterial cutdowns chemoembolized tumors liver visualize renal artery
stenosis. don't use general anesthesia this. uncomfortable people
anxious three conditions. One standard care, push


button get opioids, IV. - surgery? - surgery. second
is, that, plus friendly nurse, comforting them. So, controlled
pleasant attention support. third was, taught self-hypnosis
pain control. So, feeling, can change temperature, body
cool, tingling, numb, floating ice water feeling comfortable. go
somewhere else, leave body go desert island enjoy yourself.
found that, two half hour procedure, hour half,
hypnosis group reduced pain 80%, compared standard, - Wow. care
group, using half amount opioids, fewer complications procedure
took 17 minutes less time average get done. not patient
relaxed. treatment staff. weren't dealing someone
struggling uncomfortable. measured anxiety thing.
hypnosis group, worried dead. no anxiety hour
half, saying, fine, know, fine. standard care
group, 5 10 anxiety scores point. So, published Lancet,
big randomized trial. drug that, every hospital country
using now, no industry push it. So, part helped us decide
needed help people, Reveri teach
provide interactive support it. it, question, although is,
work long term? 'Cause can acutely doesn't necessarily carry on. So,
around randomized trial women metastatic breast cancer.
advancing disease. met support group week taught
self-hypnosis, stress anxiety pain control end. end
year, treatment group half pain control group did, same,
low amounts medication. So, lasts. say, felt pain
chest thought metastasis, just exercise. got warm bath
felt fine. So, works becomes skill people acquire, can
tell right away, whether likely help them, working clinician now using
app ways helping learn use skill. So, nice thing will
know quickly, whether likely help not. is, can learn
yourself. - great will, again, there'll link Reveri caption,
available Apple Android. think even though nominal cost there,
think that, mentioned, medications approaches dealing
problems quite expensive, potential side effects things. Not


aren't also useful. - I, get that, - Please. - just one
thing. worked hard app. iOS app Apple. decided
table moment, redoing Android app. So, available,
working Alexa platform. not moment will soon. So, just
don't want people disappointed looking Android,
agenda don't moment.

00:56:53 Eliminating Obsessive Thoughts, Superstitions

- Great, thanks clarification. hopefully, time both, get asked lot
obsessive thoughts intrusive thoughts. also get asked lot OCD.
evidence hypnosis self-hypnosis can used for, dealing obsessive
thoughts? - Sometimes, obsessional people, just turn not
hypnotizable for, yeah, not random. tend controlling
thought, busy evaluating rather experiencing, so- - know people
like that. [David laughing] sounds like adaptive mindset lot professions. -
right. - get trained that, - Yeah. - school, obsess
exam, obsess the, - Yeah. - social interactions. mean, part
becoming functional human being. yet, can take us different- -
sometimes overdo it. mean, tell one example extreme situations, that,
know, judging, evaluating, not letting experience, including
emotionally. know somebody, listens tapes airplanes go down. So,
get black box listen it. said me, know- -
profession recreational- - No, profession. - Okay. -
did. 'Cause trying accident prevention handle things.
said worry people panicking, right? guys know
got 30 seconds 45 seconds just going
checklist. said, don't panic enough. taught do.
reason, good reason it. sometimes overdo it. painful
listen 'cause know going happen. So, kind balance
hit. sometimes get emotional absorbed not
enough sort see possibilities. can problem.
hand, sometimes rigid controlled don't let emotions guide
need protect protect others. So, say


general people OCD are, less hypnotizable side spectrum,
less likely allow engage any, typical example checking
OCD example, don't remember, whether locked door turned off
gas oven keep going back keep checking. So,
evaluative component brain, kind overrides experiential one sometimes
people can get benefit, not group select
likely respond self hypnotic approaches. - superstitions similar? -
Superstitions, think more, people hypnotizable, keep
getting caught things like superstitions there, imagination supplants
reality. seen lot happening recently. think there,
possible helped learning sort see put context, see
different point view. - developed pretty vicious superstition,
college hard break, actually. always feel, talk clinicians,
reveal certain things pathology. - Please do. - so- - get
bill later. - Thank you, yes, part reason arranged this. [David laughing] No,
just kidding. yeah, did. habit knocking wood things noticed
started to, sneak knocking wood every 'cause didn't want
people think often. started realize that, becoming
little bit reflex. saw incredible video Bence Olveczky's lab
Harvard. studies motor patterns. rats press different
sequences levers turn dials order get pellet food. that,
start introduce behaviors nothing actual lever
pressing, like start scratching hind quarters things like that. hat,
heads, excuse me, don't wear hats flipping ears. just like
pitcher throwing baseball. this, - Oh, yeah. - start incorporate
motor behaviors unrelated outcome, mind somehow starts think
necessary outcome. incorporate it. So, decided
break simply forcing not week. - Mm-hm. just
seemed like ridiculous, - [Both] thing do. Yeah, well- - Knock wood. - call
response prevention works. is, set new context
brain, get outcome want, devoid extraneous behavior. - Yeah,
knew nuts, right. knew illogical. - Right.

01:01:50 ‘Hypnotizability’, Spiegel Eye-roll Test

utility hypnosis stress reduction, phobias, pain, possibly, don't know for,
things like ADHD OCD, just will depend hypnotizability. - Right. - talked
beautiful study the, metastatic breast cancer outcome patients.
Hypnotizability clearly key variable. - Yes. - please tell us,
hypnotizability is, evaluated Spiegel Eye-Roll Test is? - Okay,
sure. So, hypnotizability just capacity hypnotic experiences.

logic, growing DLPFC point imposing cognitive structure
experience. people start lose hypnotic ability. time
early 20s, hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed. study done
Stanford, Ernest Hillard, Phil Zimbardo this, looking at, tracked
students psych one, hypnotizability measured retested
blindly 25 years later. test, retest correlation was, want guess
was? - guessing it's, don't know, 0.6 something. - Yeah, close. 0.7, IQ
0.6, 25 year interval. - Wow. - So, stable IQ 25
year interval. So, point, are. factors


lead that? Well, means that, third adults just
not hypnotizable. Two thirds are, 15% extremely hypnotizable can
measure give number 0 10. useful.
patients it, say, look, sorry, not hypnotizable going
something else. Medication, systematic desensitization, mindfulness, things
hypnotizable, just go it. don't lot explaining. People
low moderate hypnotizable, like explanations doing,
can still get benefits. So, helps guide nature treatment
people. Now, eye roll is, father used use eye fixation induction, used
say, look ceiling now close eyes looking up. very,
yes, very- - Yeah [indistinct] [laughs]. - noticed two patients back
back. one woman seen work with, hysterical seizures.
just suddenly start shaking. And- - Real epileptic seizures? - No, pseudo
epileptic seizures. - see, hysteria. - Hysteria, although people both,
the, people, real epilepsy becomes framework gets elaborated on,
stressed, seizures. just pseudo epilepsy, no EEG
abnormalities. really something watch. husband move
work bench near door, started seizure, run home
try help it. bad. noticed
did, looked up, one seizure events, see
sclera, don't see Iris anymore. start seize. great thing
her. taught seizures. Everybody else telling stop.
made one. hypnotized her, [indistinct] go back last time
one sure enough, start shake. gradually make smaller

PTSD, confront, don't avoid it, don't suppress it. confront figure
deal it. next patient rigid obsessional businessman
wanted stop controlling [chuckles], reminded me,
New Yorker cartoon driver, comes yield sign yells, "Never!"
always [indistinct]. - sounds right, New Yorker. - Yeah, New
Yorker. so, guy, tried look up, couldn't keep eyes
closed them. so, father started testing people. seemed
rough correlation capacity keep eyes up, closed
measured hypnotizability. - people listening [stutters], watching


video. So, Spiegel Eye-Roll Test, involves looking ceiling. So, tilting
head back, tilting chin back looking ceiling now. also
directing eyes upward eyes open. eye roll test involves
then, closing eyelids eyes open. - open. - whether not,
eyes roll back said it, see sclera, white part. - see sclera,
white part. - means you're, hypnotizable moderately hypnotizable. -
Right. - Whereas eyes move see iris, colored part eye
eyes close, less hypnotizable. - Right. - can look online there, just
put Spiegel Eye-Roll Test find it. also going actual
example hypnosis video later. - Right. So, asking brain something
difficult, keep eyes closing eyelids. contradictory signals
third, fourth sixth cranial nerve nuclei control eye movement. - said
third- - Fourth six, - Yup. - cranial nerve nuclei. suspending one
activity, asking another eye movements lot levels
consciousness. periaqueductal gray, surrounds cranial nerve nuclei.
close eyes sleep, rapid eye movement dream.
drugs, affect level consciousness, can affect eyes eye movements,
either dilation contraction pupils, depending whether stimulant
opioid. - Stimulants, make pupils big. - Big, right? - Yeah. Like cocaine,
amphetamine. - Right, exactly. - Things sort. - opioids, get constricted
pupils. - parents looking kids coming door late night,
looking substance abuse. - right. - Yeah. - So, something
eyes lot level consciousness. mean, obviously, close
eyes go sleep, rapid eye movement dreaming.
So, not surprising. old Zen practice called, looking third eye.
think part reason happens is, looking inside like
third eye two forehead. think
visual creatures, pretty pathetic physical point view. Many animals

father. So, Spiegel senior Spiegel junior? - Spiegel senior. -
developed Spiegel Eye-Roll Test. - key issue this, normally
close eyes also, going sleep. not worried going

turning inward. unusual state. Normally close eyes periodically,
to, close eyes period time, normally go


sleep not worried detecting risk threat. So, interesting state
turning inward, basically, looking up, shutting eyes
allowing whatever happens outside happen focusing
going inward. So, think signal brain turn inward. - interesting.
meditation course, done eyes open almost always done
eyes closed. - Yes, right. - interesting. So, can quickly determine
whether not someone highly hypnotizable. - Right. - not hypnotizable.
said two thirds people can hypnotized. - Right. - Obviously third cannot.
within two thirds can, range, said 15% people fall
this, highly hypnotizable category. - Right, correct. - seem member
of. - Yeah. - And, repeated use self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis, increase
change hypnotizability, can access first place? - say
general, may increase little bit, not hell lot, not worth effort
increase hypnotizability point. worth trying deal problem,
dealing with. So, can get better using level have.
study done tried train people hypnotizable
obviously, there're subjective behavioral components test, can learn
little better them. found reanalyze data,
account three times final score, based initial hypnotizability
measurement, rather whether not trained better. So,
can improve little

01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)

not worth trouble. - Got it. Along lines eyes eye movements, lot
interest EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. -
Shapiro working, wasn't Stanford directly, local
Stanford. - Yeah. - think Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - thoughts
EMDR? useful, think less useful? things
EMDR combined make useful? listeners podcast
come to, think, come podcast range backgrounds interests. me,
makes sense EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given newer
data can suppress amygdala activity animals animal models
humans well. really hasn't explored much, neurally. heard things like,


coordinates two sides brain, it, just throwaway. don't think
evidence that, coordinating two sides brain better not
coordinating. wouldn't speaking right now two sides brain, well
correlated. - Yeah. - language lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - heard
mimics, rapid eye movements sleep, actually doesn't. So, - Right. -
heard people talk positive experiences EMDR.
thoughts EMDR? - Yeah, good comment one recent
podcasts. tell you, one way sort think bemused point view,
old, mentioned earlier, oldest sort idea hypnotic induction,
dangling watch, right? [indistinct] watch. And, fact, enough concern
automobiles invented, movement prevent

fortunately that, tend not look windshield wipers. keep looking

think, combination exposure based treatments, use
EMDR think it. tend not process experience much just

things. So, tend think that, EMDR another form exposure based therapy
trauma, implied exception possible new data, certainly
doesn't with, rapid eye movement sleep. don't think moving eyes
issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put
weight this, going re-injure ankle example, simply mean
body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat
something coming opportunity something ameliorate situation. So,
not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding
happening. face also say, opportunity
something it. minute realistically enha- doesn't mean,
imagine away heart attack. means figure rehabilitate heart attack


broken leg something like way get much control

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body
floating, safe comfortable. Now, picture Mary sit feeling sadness
no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,
watch it, try [stutters]. work enjoying together shows
breathing patterns may increase sympathetic arousal may decrease. may
[indistinct] cyclic sighing seems to, actually, time spent exhaling

absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go
automatically can control it. so, kind way us demonstrate
ourselves, greater ways modulating internal state. So, can either it,
thinking it, way pain control hypnosis can

want see happen body. So, like right margin,
can enhance, me, like way augmenting hypnosis,
medication, think powerful way that. - Great, really excited see

directed mental focus, seem key elements hypnosis. missing


ingredients? - Yeah, think right. - It's- - Breathing, vision, - Breathing, vision,
change vision don't, know, typically physically relaxed
state, frankly people peak performance, including physical athletic
performance musical performance hypnotic states too. talked
classical pianists say, not thinking, start thinking fingers
now, screw up. floating piano, thinking tone want
feel exuding instrument. hypnotic like state too. many athletes
peak performance, just flowing it. not thinking step step,
doing? best working
giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much
always you. can people learn about, can get
hypnotized? mentioned Reveri, put link it, R-E-V-E-R-I.com way
access that. - Reveri app app store, way. reveri.com
website, can get download Reveri app app
store. - Great. So, currently apple, hopefully soon, also Android,
meantime, people interested exploring clinical hypnosis, working
somebody similar? centralized resource people can go find, really
well-trained hypnotists? - two good professional organizations will help
that. One society clinical experimental hypnosis. think
sceh.us their- - Okay, look provide link. - American society
clinical hypnosis, provide referral services professionals. can look
up. just say general, look someone licensed trained
primary professional discipline, psychiatry, psychology, medicine, dentistry
training interest using hypnosis, way it. - Great one
question comment. question is, will psychiatrist? - [laughs]
honored. - tall task. might stubborn patient. - think hardest
work's already done, Andrew. - Thank you. - fine, now. - appreciate that.
[David laughing] Well, final thing comment. First all, thank much
today, sharing knowledge. - welcome. - hope can
again. - hope so. - love working laboratory you. -
Likewise [indistinct]. - speak, learn know others well. -
Thank you. - will put resources get also just want say, thank


work do. - Well, thank you. - incredible thing world
discovering much body works, mind still rather
mysterious people struggling lot things, also think people
really excited about, applying tools like hypnosis perform better, feel better mentally
physically. pointed us tremendous amount resources
tools work already demonstrated work. just, thank
you. know professional commitment life benefit. So, thank
so. - Well, thank you, real joy collaborating
using precision knowledge neuroanatomy, neurobiology
address problems often people disciplined primary
neurobiological end, aren't interested are. so, really pleasure
try bring together know different perspectives build
something neither us alone. so, real joy it. -
Thank you, honored.

heat." bought dog, - love it. - named it, Spiegel. - love it. - Talk
transference. - love it. [David laughing]

00:37:19 Restructuring Trauma Narratives

really speaks power this. brings back issue. So,
different about, father case woman, terms
happened hypnosis allowed go completely terrified dogs
owning dog naming father? find amusing. - Yeah. -
different just two sitting talking it, right? know,
therapy, narrative huge component. - Right. - hypnosis narrative huge
component. - Right. - must that, brain state really different.
talk trauma minutes. think people trauma
phobias, certainly conversation it. might freeze up.
might lose articulation forth. different
state combines narrative, think allow underlying neural networks
engage change? 'Cause find fascinating a- Every attempt
dealing stress phobia clinical setting involves discussion
is. - Yes. - But, not talking medication introduced,
least not particular circumstances. - Right. - So, realize kind obvious
question like, difference brain activity, find incredible.
control variable brain state. not, spoken. - raising
couple important issues, Andrew. talked earlier systematic
desensitization, sort lay hierarchy things one time.
think unsystematic desensitization, changing mental states.


think evidence mental state change
therapeutic potential. seeing ketamine treating depression,
dissociogenic drug. know every morning wake up, problem,
know, made mistake reading nasty email 11:00 PM. didn't know
do. wake morning thinking, oh, idiot, yeah,
going do. So, just changing mental state, therapeutic potential. think
underestimate ability regulate change responses cognitively,
emotionally somatically flexible. so, things, right, follow similar
principles facing problem, seeing different point view. done
really, nice podcast trauma stress expose it,
not avoid it, talked before. find way reconnect it,
substitute something can make feel good, rather bad, activate
centers brain like mesolimbic reward system. so, hypnosis
can much faster. People don't think can can.
having, right now physical experience, thinking not feeling
bad used to. can powerful thing can hypnosis. So,
woman came see me, suffered attempted rape. getting dark,
coming back grocery store guy grabs wants get
apartment. outside apartment. starts fighting
winds basilar skull fracture. runs away. cops come, since hadn't
raped, left, weren't interested. wanted use hypnosis get
better image guy looked like, painful, upsetting thing. So,
quite hypnotizable. got floating. say, safe comfortable, now, nothing
can happen will harm body. left side screen, want
picture guy approaching happening. said, really,
light, getting dark. really can't see much facial features, recognize
something, hadn't allowed remember. gets upstairs, doesn't just
want rape me, going kill me. so, ways, seeing
even worse. So, thinking, good, Spiegel, made even frightened
before. pointed PTSD stress lecture, got
confront trauma, restructure understanding it. So, side
screen, picture, protect yourself? everybody
trauma situation engages strategy self protection. salience network
kicking in. said, "You know what?" surprised fighting hard.


didn't think would. so, realized one hand even worse
thought was. hand actually probably saved life.
so, way of, helping restructure experience trauma make
tolerable. helped her- didn't recog- couldn't identify guy,
helped restructure understand experience. something
can just talking, straight psychotherapy. sometimes can hell
lot faster efficiently using hypnosis. one randomized trial
Israel shows adding hypnosis PTSD treatment, actually improves
outcome. way accomplishing things understand broader
psychotherapy world, much quickly sometimes effectively. - Yeah,
sounds like going somewhat state one trying deal with,
dissociating state key. imagine, open
various podcasts. done lot analysis years. experienced
sessions, depending show them, might just get kind
laundry list happened opposed actually feeling anything, around
happened. - Right. - think people probably vary extent can
drop feeling states can depend day. can depend well
slept night on. - one thing might add, Andrew, - Yes. -
is, notion late Gordon Bower, just memorial Gordon
Stanford. died year ago. Brilliant cognitive psychologist, one founders
cognitive psychology Stanford great pitcher. almost became Major
League pitcher decided go grad school instead, glad did.
Gordon helped establish concept state dependent memory
certain mental state, enhance ability remember things it. sort
bad example drunk hides bottle can't remember
put gets drunk mental state. People go
dissociative states traumatized. way, hypnosis helping
remember deal memories better mental state
like happened. rape victims will tell you, floating
body, feeling sorry woman assaulted below. People traumatic
episodes, just say, know, blank out, don't know happening,
autopilot kind self hypnotic state. So, use hypnosis help
deal traumatic memory, making state in, right office
you, congruent state likely in, trauma happened.


think part helps facilitate treatment trauma related disorders. -
see.

00:45:14 Ketamine Therapy

makes ask, every question ask, 'cause really feel
almost like compulsion, dissociation traumatic episode is, part
adaptive strategy. - Right. - creates certain issues, creates problems, right?
something like ketamine, creates dissociative state, useful
treatment trauma? confused days colleague,
Karl Deisseroth, also podcast coworkers figured out,
okay, layer one networks neocortex, involved
dissociative state. starting gain understanding ketamine
works neural level. - Right. - seem, certain populations can
useful treatment. don't know, never tried it. don't know current status
is, legal. allowed least in, FDA approved use.
dissociative states useful element dissociation gave rise
trauma memory first place? - Well, yeah, Karl brilliant paper
nature he, rats humans one paper. showed
rhythmic discharge retrosplenial region, triggered ketamine.
rats actually showed dissociative like behavior, hot pad
ordinarily wouldn't didn't seem much pain paw.
male subject implanted electrodes- - Human, yeah. - human subject, yeah.
electrodes picked rhythmic activity. did,
report dissociative state. description was, like pilot
airplane. felt walking cockpit plane still flying
and- - sounds terrifying me. [David laughing] sounds terrify terrifying. -
thing- - want body, [David laughing] time, know. -
right but, point is, way principal, Andrew, like, principle said,
need re-confront traumatic situation can modulate associations
it. So, accept it, accept arousal, put boundaries around
figure can approach problem approach
problem different point view. So, not surprise- fact, studied,
people disassociated Loma Prieta earthquake Oakland-Berkeley


firestorm. - remember well. - Yeah. - Earthquakes follow me. move
south Northridge quake- - going keep away So, there'll one
later, afternoon. [David laughing] - starting dissociating. So, dissociation
compartmentalize experience, means point view treating trauma,
inhibition. don't engage it. like happened there. think
happens people, sometimes good able separate
recollection. somewhere. sight not mind.
effects you, can't deal it. can't reprocess it. think
one reason ketamine might work fact, allows keep, re-approach
dissociative experience way can start think something
it. just fact can turn off. also self-hypnosis
helpful. not something just comes happens you.
something can make happen. can control it, can something it. So,
feel less helpless control. essence trauma helplessness. not
fear, not pain. helplessness. become object. become just body.
don't control going on. not used that. discussed
breathing paper anticipation breathing. not whether breathe, inhale
exhale hold breath, think can inhale can't,
really upsetting, understandably. so, issue control hypnosis,
terrible reputation taking away control actually superb way enhancing
control mind body. - love reminds naming important.
almost wonder self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis called something
else, would've separated stage hypnosis way make
less scary, weird, complicated people embrace. But, - Yeah. - part reason
discussion is, great experiences hypnosis, seen
data, talking lot clinical examples. incredibly powerful boils
right neural brain states. - Right. - And,

00:50:07 Self-directed Hypnosis, Reveri

think years come, going become widespread along lines.
quickly, described examples people getting relief quickly. -
Right. - permanent, changes? need follow related
that, sure number people listening thinking, wonderful, love


get hypnotized number different things Dr. Spiegel somebody else expert
clinical hypnosis, might not access somebody similar
training. power? So, quickly work? long lasting
changes? then, necessary work clinical hypnotist? better
self-hypnosis forth? Maybe just give us contour
landscape directed self-directed treatment. - Well, typically, people
start coming see clinician like me. better see someone licensing
training professional discipline, medicine, psychology, dentistry, whatever. -
'Cause lot hypnotists there, just hypnotist. - Right. Just
hypnotists. - Oh, okay. - key issue is, somebody can really assess
problem make sure not, talking someone reducing chest
pain, rather getting coronary artery problem- - 'Cause real
issue there. - could, right. - hypnosis might adjust wouldn't deal
deeper underlying issue. - right. hand. typically use
people, often see twice periodically, not every week.
certainly not every day, pain problem hypnosis helpful pain.
so, is, identifying hypnotizable are. give standard
brief test ability experience hypnosis, going self-hypnosis
exercise deal problem, seeing respond it,
teaching themselves. old days, used use
iPhone record part session. play back hypnosis
experience. Now developed app, "Reveri," can teach people step
through, dealing pain, stress, focus, insomnia help people eat better
stop smoking. elements take 15 minutes elements just
take one two minutes people can refresh reinforce. - Two minute hypnosis,
[indistinct] one minute. - Yes. - Yeah. - one two, one two minutes
now, finding two thirds people find even just one minute
refresher, helps feel better. reporting, feel better. So, nice thing is,
know right away, whether likely help not. found, done
studies, looking hypnosis pain relief acute medical procedures.
randomized trial published Lancet, three conditions, people getting
arterial cutdowns chemoembolized tumors liver visualize renal artery
stenosis. don't use general anesthesia this. uncomfortable people
anxious three conditions. One standard care, push


button get opioids, IV. - surgery? - surgery. second
is, that, plus friendly nurse, comforting them. So, controlled
pleasant attention support. third was, taught self-hypnosis
pain control. So, feeling, can change temperature, body
cool, tingling, numb, floating ice water feeling comfortable. go
somewhere else, leave body go desert island enjoy yourself.
found that, two half hour procedure, hour half,
hypnosis group reduced pain 80%, compared standard, - Wow. care
group, using half amount opioids, fewer complications procedure
took 17 minutes less time average get done. not patient
relaxed. treatment staff. weren't dealing someone
struggling uncomfortable. measured anxiety thing.
hypnosis group, worried dead. no anxiety hour
half, saying, fine, know, fine. standard care
group, 5 10 anxiety scores point. So, published Lancet,
big randomized trial. drug that, every hospital country
using now, no industry push it. So, part helped us decide
needed help people, Reveri teach
provide interactive support it. it, question, although is,
work long term? 'Cause can acutely doesn't necessarily carry on. So,
around randomized trial women metastatic breast cancer.
advancing disease. met support group week taught
self-hypnosis, stress anxiety pain control end. end
year, treatment group half pain control group did, same,
low amounts medication. So, lasts. say, felt pain
chest thought metastasis, just exercise. got warm bath
felt fine. So, works becomes skill people acquire, can
tell right away, whether likely help them, working clinician now using
app ways helping learn use skill. So, nice thing will
know quickly, whether likely help not. is, can learn
yourself. - great will, again, there'll link Reveri caption,
available Apple Android. think even though nominal cost there,
think that, mentioned, medications approaches dealing
problems quite expensive, potential side effects things. Not


aren't also useful. - I, get that, - Please. - just one
thing. worked hard app. iOS app Apple. decided
table moment, redoing Android app. So, available,
working Alexa platform. not moment will soon. So, just
don't want people disappointed looking Android,
agenda don't moment.

00:56:53 Eliminating Obsessive Thoughts, Superstitions

- Great, thanks clarification. hopefully, time both, get asked lot
obsessive thoughts intrusive thoughts. also get asked lot OCD.
evidence hypnosis self-hypnosis can used for, dealing obsessive
thoughts? - Sometimes, obsessional people, just turn not
hypnotizable for, yeah, not random. tend controlling
thought, busy evaluating rather experiencing, so- - know people
like that. [David laughing] sounds like adaptive mindset lot professions. -
right. - get trained that, - Yeah. - school, obsess
exam, obsess the, - Yeah. - social interactions. mean, part
becoming functional human being. yet, can take us different- -
sometimes overdo it. mean, tell one example extreme situations, that,
know, judging, evaluating, not letting experience, including
emotionally. know somebody, listens tapes airplanes go down. So,
get black box listen it. said me, know- -
profession recreational- - No, profession. - Okay. -
did. 'Cause trying accident prevention handle things.
said worry people panicking, right? guys know
got 30 seconds 45 seconds just going
checklist. said, don't panic enough. taught do.
reason, good reason it. sometimes overdo it. painful
listen 'cause know going happen. So, kind balance
hit. sometimes get emotional absorbed not
enough sort see possibilities. can problem.
hand, sometimes rigid controlled don't let emotions guide
need protect protect others. So, say


general people OCD are, less hypnotizable side spectrum,
less likely allow engage any, typical example checking
OCD example, don't remember, whether locked door turned off
gas oven keep going back keep checking. So,
evaluative component brain, kind overrides experiential one sometimes
people can get benefit, not group select
likely respond self hypnotic approaches. - superstitions similar? -
Superstitions, think more, people hypnotizable, keep
getting caught things like superstitions there, imagination supplants
reality. seen lot happening recently. think there,
possible helped learning sort see put context, see
different point view. - developed pretty vicious superstition,
college hard break, actually. always feel, talk clinicians,
reveal certain things pathology. - Please do. - so- - get
bill later. - Thank you, yes, part reason arranged this. [David laughing] No,
just kidding. yeah, did. habit knocking wood things noticed
started to, sneak knocking wood every 'cause didn't want
people think often. started realize that, becoming
little bit reflex. saw incredible video Bence Olveczky's lab
Harvard. studies motor patterns. rats press different
sequences levers turn dials order get pellet food. that,
start introduce behaviors nothing actual lever
pressing, like start scratching hind quarters things like that. hat,
heads, excuse me, don't wear hats flipping ears. just like
pitcher throwing baseball. this, - Oh, yeah. - start incorporate
motor behaviors unrelated outcome, mind somehow starts think
necessary outcome. incorporate it. So, decided
break simply forcing not week. - Mm-hm. just
seemed like ridiculous, - [Both] thing do. Yeah, well- - Knock wood. - call
response prevention works. is, set new context
brain, get outcome want, devoid extraneous behavior. - Yeah,
knew nuts, right. knew illogical. - Right.

01:01:50 ‘Hypnotizability’, Spiegel Eye-roll Test



- somehow things take meaning. - [David] Right. - So, talked about,
utility hypnosis stress reduction, phobias, pain, possibly, don't know for,
things like ADHD OCD, just will depend hypnotizability. - Right. - talked
beautiful study the, metastatic breast cancer outcome patients.
Hypnotizability clearly key variable. - Yes. - please tell us,
hypnotizability is, evaluated Spiegel Eye-Roll Test is? - Okay,
sure. So, hypnotizability just capacity hypnotic experiences.
test called hypnotic conduction profile. give highly structured hypnotic
experience. old tradition clinical hypnosis was, try bunch
different things, talking, walking upstairs downstairs images time
say breathing subject that. change
clinician, less can make variation outcome. take
long time, know, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. just view kind complex,
not effective way assessing person's hypnotic capacity. know
peak period hypnotizability human life, latency years childhood. So,
every eight year old trance time. call 'em dinner, don't
hear ya, thing. childhood wonderful
experience. Work play thing. try make little
adults, think terrible mistake. Everything fun them. enjoy learning,
enjoy everything. - age this- - like 6 10, 6 11.
playful, enjoy everything. Everything sort game fun try
make miserable them, got it. when, Piaget called,
adult cognitive framework, learn abstract concepts, learn even one
bottle looks bigger other, can equal volume. so, imposing
logic, growing DLPFC point imposing cognitive structure
experience. people start lose hypnotic ability. time
early 20s, hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed. study done
Stanford, Ernest Hillard, Phil Zimbardo this, looking at, tracked
students psych one, hypnotizability measured retested
blindly 25 years later. test, retest correlation was, want guess
was? - guessing it's, don't know, 0.6 something. - Yeah, close. 0.7, IQ
0.6, 25 year interval. - Wow. - So, stable IQ 25
year interval. So, point, are. factors


lead that? Well, means that, third adults just
not hypnotizable. Two thirds are, 15% extremely hypnotizable can
measure give number 0 10. useful.
patients it, say, look, sorry, not hypnotizable going
something else. Medication, systematic desensitization, mindfulness, things
hypnotizable, just go it. don't lot explaining. People
low moderate hypnotizable, like explanations doing,
can still get benefits. So, helps guide nature treatment
people. Now, eye roll is, father used use eye fixation induction, used
say, look ceiling now close eyes looking up. very,
yes, very- - Yeah [indistinct] [laughs]. - noticed two patients back
back. one woman seen work with, hysterical seizures.
just suddenly start shaking. And- - Real epileptic seizures? - No, pseudo
epileptic seizures. - see, hysteria. - Hysteria, although people both,
the, people, real epilepsy becomes framework gets elaborated on,
stressed, seizures. just pseudo epilepsy, no EEG
abnormalities. really something watch. husband move
work bench near door, started seizure, run home
try help it. bad. noticed
did, looked up, one seizure events, see
sclera, don't see Iris anymore. start seize. great thing
her. taught seizures. Everybody else telling stop.
made one. hypnotized her, [indistinct] go back last time
one sure enough, start shake. gradually make smaller
smaller. So, learning control, access, like
PTSD, confront, don't avoid it, don't suppress it. confront figure
deal it. next patient rigid obsessional businessman
wanted stop controlling [chuckles], reminded me,
New Yorker cartoon driver, comes yield sign yells, "Never!"
always [indistinct]. - sounds right, New Yorker. - Yeah, New
Yorker. so, guy, tried look up, couldn't keep eyes
closed them. so, father started testing people. seemed
rough correlation capacity keep eyes up, closed
measured hypnotizability. - people listening [stutters], watching


video. So, Spiegel Eye-Roll Test, involves looking ceiling. So, tilting
head back, tilting chin back looking ceiling now. also
directing eyes upward eyes open. eye roll test involves
then, closing eyelids eyes open. - open. - whether not,
eyes roll back said it, see sclera, white part. - see sclera,
white part. - means you're, hypnotizable moderately hypnotizable. -
Right. - Whereas eyes move see iris, colored part eye
eyes close, less hypnotizable. - Right. - can look online there, just
put Spiegel Eye-Roll Test find it. also going actual
example hypnosis video later. - Right. So, asking brain something
difficult, keep eyes closing eyelids. contradictory signals
third, fourth sixth cranial nerve nuclei control eye movement. - said
third- - Fourth six, - Yup. - cranial nerve nuclei. suspending one
activity, asking another eye movements lot levels
consciousness. periaqueductal gray, surrounds cranial nerve nuclei.
close eyes sleep, rapid eye movement dream.
drugs, affect level consciousness, can affect eyes eye movements,
either dilation contraction pupils, depending whether stimulant
opioid. - Stimulants, make pupils big. - Big, right? - Yeah. Like cocaine,
amphetamine. - Right, exactly. - Things sort. - opioids, get constricted
pupils. - parents looking kids coming door late night,
looking substance abuse. - right. - Yeah. - So, something
eyes lot level consciousness. mean, obviously, close
eyes go sleep, rapid eye movement dreaming.
So, not surprising. old Zen practice called, looking third eye.
think part reason happens is, looking inside like
third eye two forehead. think
visual creatures, pretty pathetic physical point view. Many animals
can outrun us, outs smell us eagles read newsprint hundred yards
can't. So, major defensive sensory input vision. animals,
predator animals eyes front head, good,
detailed vision prey. Whereas prey animals like deer, eyes side
head. So, don't see things well, much bigger range potential
see threat. mainly use, fact, interesting, social


anthropologists say, gather do, coastlines edge
forest something, got protection back. Something can
attack one side big vision might threaten you.
tend attracted kinds physical situations, so- - Yeah, love vistas. -
love vistas, right. - Vistas calming. take us panoramic
vision. - right. - didn't know this, turns scenic spots
location national parks people naturally aggregated was-
makes sense. - Sure. - But, signs locations built around, people's
tendency animals tendencies. - Oh, really [indistinct]? - aggregate there. Yeah,
interesting book history national parks says, didn't
give research study support it, no Google Maps, obviously. -
interesting. - Yeah, panorama visual boundaries really interesting. think,
eyes, know, two pieces central nervous system brain,
outside the- - Right. used say eyes outside skull neuro-
ophthalmologist wrote vehemently pointed outside
cranial vault, so, know. outside cranial vault two pieces
brain there. so, mentioned cranial nerves, three, four six.
isn't neuroanatomy course maybe go little deeper there. So, said
contradictory activity, looking controlled one set cranial nerves.
closing eyelids, controlled another cranial nerve. - No,
one. think six close eyes, activate, no, facial,
guess facial nerve. 7, yeah. - 7, yeah. - looking up, activating
muscles force eyes look up. closing eyelids normally relaxes
those, relaxes upper movement, eyes closed don't
need it. breaking usual customary pattern. - like rubbing the, -
Right. - hey, can't even it, see like the, - Right. [Andrew David laughing] -
exactly right. - Rubbing tummy patting head. bit
conflict there, - Right. - clinically, good probe you, - has. -
father. So, Spiegel senior Spiegel junior? - Spiegel senior. -
developed Spiegel Eye-Roll Test. - key issue this, normally
close eyes also, going sleep. not worried going
world anymore. Here, maintaining resting alertness. So, focusing
turning inward. unusual state. Normally close eyes periodically,
to, close eyes period time, normally go


sleep not worried detecting risk threat. So, interesting state
turning inward, basically, looking up, shutting eyes
allowing whatever happens outside happen focusing
going inward. So, think signal brain turn inward. - interesting.
meditation course, done eyes open almost always done
eyes closed. - Yes, right. - interesting. So, can quickly determine
whether not someone highly hypnotizable. - Right. - not hypnotizable.
said two thirds people can hypnotized. - Right. - Obviously third cannot.
within two thirds can, range, said 15% people fall
this, highly hypnotizable category. - Right, correct. - seem member
of. - Yeah. - And, repeated use self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis, increase
change hypnotizability, can access first place? - say
general, may increase little bit, not hell lot, not worth effort
increase hypnotizability point. worth trying deal problem,
dealing with. So, can get better using level have.
study done tried train people hypnotizable
obviously, there're subjective behavioral components test, can learn
little better them. found reanalyze data,
account three times final score, based initial hypnotizability
measurement, rather whether not trained better. So,
can improve little

01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)

not worth trouble. - Got it. Along lines eyes eye movements, lot
interest EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. -
Shapiro working, wasn't Stanford directly, local
Stanford. - Yeah. - think Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - thoughts
EMDR? useful, think less useful? things
EMDR combined make useful? listeners podcast
come to, think, come podcast range backgrounds interests. me,
makes sense EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given newer
data can suppress amygdala activity animals animal models
humans well. really hasn't explored much, neurally. heard things like,


coordinates two sides brain, it, just throwaway. don't think
evidence that, coordinating two sides brain better not
coordinating. wouldn't speaking right now two sides brain, well
correlated. - Yeah. - language lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - heard
mimics, rapid eye movements sleep, actually doesn't. So, - Right. -
heard people talk positive experiences EMDR.
thoughts EMDR? - Yeah, good comment one recent
podcasts. tell you, one way sort think bemused point view,
old, mentioned earlier, oldest sort idea hypnotic induction,
dangling watch, right? [indistinct] watch. And, fact, enough concern
automobiles invented, movement prevent
installing windshield wipers people afraid hypnotized,
watched windshield wipers go back forth car. Now, turns
fortunately that, tend not look windshield wipers. keep looking
windshield. so, windshield wipers today. movement is,
exactly used hypnotic induction. think lot hypnosis EMDR. - Ah. -
think, combination exposure based treatments, use
EMDR think it. tend not process experience much just
physical part it, personally think drawback. And, every study seen
dismantling study. no question people go EMDR, many
get better trauma related problems VA big program using
on. every program dismantled, going treatment
lateral eye movement, shown lateral eye movement, doesn't add
anything it. toward end career, Francine [indistinct]
contralateral touching something, wasn't eye movements anymore.
things. So, tend think that, EMDR another form exposure based therapy
trauma, implied exception possible new data, certainly
doesn't with, rapid eye movement sleep. don't think moving eyes
issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying

feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better

pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,

emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,

real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,
watch it, try [stutters]. work enjoying together shows
breathing patterns may increase sympathetic arousal may decrease. may
[indistinct] cyclic sighing seems to, actually, time spent exhaling

take deep breath part induction slowly exhale. partly

[stutters], enhance idea induction period relaxation, 'cause
think inducing perhaps perceiving well. So, no,
absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go
automatically can control it. so, kind way us demonstrate
ourselves, greater ways modulating internal state. So, can either it,
thinking it, way pain control hypnosis can

want see happen body. So, like right margin,
can enhance, me, like way augmenting hypnosis,
medication, think powerful way that. - Great, really excited see
goes. - Yes. - Breathing, vision, bodily states clearly the-
directed mental focus, seem key elements hypnosis. missing


ingredients? - Yeah, think right. - It's- - Breathing, vision, - Breathing, vision,
change vision don't, know, typically physically relaxed

classical pianists say, not thinking, start thinking fingers
now, screw up. floating piano, thinking tone want
feel exuding instrument. hypnotic like state too. many athletes
peak performance, just flowing it. not thinking step step,
doing? best working
giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much
always you. can people learn about, can get
hypnotized? mentioned Reveri, put link it, R-E-V-E-R-I.com way

Gordon helped establish concept state dependent memory
certain mental state, enhance ability remember things it. sort
bad example drunk hides bottle can't remember

dissociative states traumatized. way, hypnosis helping
remember deal memories better mental state
like happened. rape victims will tell you, floating
body, feeling sorry woman assaulted below. People traumatic
episodes, just say, know, blank out, don't know happening,

00:45:14 Ketamine Therapy

makes ask, every question ask, 'cause really feel
almost like compulsion, dissociation traumatic episode is, part
adaptive strategy. - Right. - creates certain issues, creates problems, right?
something like ketamine, creates dissociative state, useful
treatment trauma? confused days colleague,
Karl Deisseroth, also podcast coworkers figured out,
okay, layer one networks neocortex, involved
dissociative state. starting gain understanding ketamine
works neural level. - Right. - seem, certain populations can
useful treatment. don't know, never tried it. don't know current status
is, legal. allowed least in, FDA approved use.
dissociative states useful element dissociation gave rise
trauma memory first place? - Well, yeah, Karl brilliant paper
nature he, rats humans one paper. showed
rhythmic discharge retrosplenial region, triggered ketamine.
rats actually showed dissociative like behavior, hot pad
ordinarily wouldn't didn't seem much pain paw.
male subject implanted electrodes- - Human, yeah. - human subject, yeah.
electrodes picked rhythmic activity. did,
report dissociative state. description was, like pilot
airplane. felt walking cockpit plane still flying
and- - sounds terrifying me. [David laughing] sounds terrify terrifying. -
thing- - want body, [David laughing] time, know. -
right but, point is, way principal, Andrew, like, principle said,
need re-confront traumatic situation can modulate associations
it. So, accept it, accept arousal, put boundaries around
figure can approach problem approach
problem different point view. So, not surprise- fact, studied,
people disassociated Loma Prieta earthquake Oakland-Berkeley


firestorm. - remember well. - Yeah. - Earthquakes follow me. move
south Northridge quake- - going keep away So, there'll one
later, afternoon. [David laughing] - starting dissociating. So, dissociation
compartmentalize experience, means point view treating trauma,
inhibition. don't engage it. like happened there. think
happens people, sometimes good able separate
recollection. somewhere. sight not mind.
effects you, can't deal it. can't reprocess it. think
one reason ketamine might work fact, allows keep, re-approach
dissociative experience way can start think something
it. just fact can turn off. also self-hypnosis
helpful. not something just comes happens you.
something can make happen. can control it, can something it. So,
feel less helpless control. essence trauma helplessness. not
fear, not pain. helplessness. become object. become just body.
don't control going on. not used that. discussed
breathing paper anticipation breathing. not whether breathe, inhale
exhale hold breath, think can inhale can't,
really upsetting, understandably. so, issue control hypnosis,
terrible reputation taking away control actually superb way enhancing
control mind body. - love reminds naming important.
almost wonder self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis called something
else, would've separated stage hypnosis way make
less scary, weird, complicated people embrace. But, - Yeah. - part reason
discussion is, great experiences hypnosis, seen
data, talking lot clinical examples. incredibly powerful boils
right neural brain states. - Right. - And,

00:50:07 Self-directed Hypnosis, Reveri

think years come, going become widespread along lines.
quickly, described examples people getting relief quickly. -
Right. - permanent, changes? need follow related
that, sure number people listening thinking, wonderful, love


get hypnotized number different things Dr. Spiegel somebody else expert
clinical hypnosis, might not access somebody similar
training. power? So, quickly work? long lasting
changes? then, necessary work clinical hypnotist? better
self-hypnosis forth? Maybe just give us contour
landscape directed self-directed treatment. - Well, typically, people
start coming see clinician like me. better see someone licensing
training professional discipline, medicine, psychology, dentistry, whatever. -
'Cause lot hypnotists there, just hypnotist. - Right. Just
hypnotists. - Oh, okay. - key issue is, somebody can really assess
problem make sure not, talking someone reducing chest
pain, rather getting coronary artery problem- - 'Cause real
issue there. - could, right. - hypnosis might adjust wouldn't deal
deeper underlying issue. - right. hand. typically use
people, often see twice periodically, not every week.
certainly not every day, pain problem hypnosis helpful pain.
so, is, identifying hypnotizable are. give standard
brief test ability experience hypnosis, going self-hypnosis
exercise deal problem, seeing respond it,
teaching themselves. old days, used use
iPhone record part session. play back hypnosis
experience. Now developed app, "Reveri," can teach people step
through, dealing pain, stress, focus, insomnia help people eat better
stop smoking. elements take 15 minutes elements just
take one two minutes people can refresh reinforce. - Two minute hypnosis,
[indistinct] one minute. - Yes. - Yeah. - one two, one two minutes
now, finding two thirds people find even just one minute
refresher, helps feel better. reporting, feel better. So, nice thing is,
know right away, whether likely help not. found, done
studies, looking hypnosis pain relief acute medical procedures.
randomized trial published Lancet, three conditions, people getting
arterial cutdowns chemoembolized tumors liver visualize renal artery
stenosis. don't use general anesthesia this. uncomfortable people
anxious three conditions. One standard care, push


button get opioids, IV. - surgery? - surgery. second

found that, two half hour procedure, hour half,

took 17 minutes less time average get done. not patient
relaxed. treatment staff. weren't dealing someone
struggling uncomfortable. measured anxiety thing.
hypnosis group, worried dead. no anxiety hour
half, saying, fine, know, fine. standard care
group, 5 10 anxiety scores point. So, published Lancet,
big randomized trial. drug that, every hospital country
using now, no industry push it. So, part helped us decide
needed help people, Reveri teach
provide interactive support it. it, question, although is,
work long term? 'Cause can acutely doesn't necessarily carry on. So,
around randomized trial women metastatic breast cancer.

felt fine. So, works becomes skill people acquire, can
tell right away, whether likely help them, working clinician now using

know quickly, whether likely help not. is, can learn

00:56:53 Eliminating Obsessive Thoughts, Superstitions

- Great, thanks clarification. hopefully, time both, get asked lot
obsessive thoughts intrusive thoughts. also get asked lot OCD.
evidence hypnosis self-hypnosis can used for, dealing obsessive
thoughts? - Sometimes, obsessional people, just turn not
hypnotizable for, yeah, not random. tend controlling
thought, busy evaluating rather experiencing, so- - know people
like that. [David laughing] sounds like adaptive mindset lot professions. -
right. - get trained that, - Yeah. - school, obsess
exam, obsess the, - Yeah. - social interactions. mean, part
becoming functional human being. yet, can take us different- -
sometimes overdo it. mean, tell one example extreme situations, that,
know, judging, evaluating, not letting experience, including
emotionally. know somebody, listens tapes airplanes go down. So,
get black box listen it. said me, know- -
profession recreational- - No, profession. - Okay. -
did. 'Cause trying accident prevention handle things.
said worry people panicking, right? guys know
got 30 seconds 45 seconds just going
checklist. said, don't panic enough. taught do.
reason, good reason it. sometimes overdo it. painful
listen 'cause know going happen. So, kind balance
hit. sometimes get emotional absorbed not
enough sort see possibilities. can problem.
hand, sometimes rigid controlled don't let emotions guide
need protect protect others. So, say


general people OCD are, less hypnotizable side spectrum,
less likely allow engage any, typical example checking
OCD example, don't remember, whether locked door turned off
gas oven keep going back keep checking. So,
evaluative component brain, kind overrides experiential one sometimes
people can get benefit, not group select
likely respond self hypnotic approaches. - superstitions similar? -
Superstitions, think more, people hypnotizable, keep
getting caught things like superstitions there, imagination supplants
reality. seen lot happening recently. think there,
possible helped learning sort see put context, see
different point view. - developed pretty vicious superstition,
college hard break, actually. always feel, talk clinicians,
reveal certain things pathology. - Please do. - so- - get
bill later. - Thank you, yes, part reason arranged this. [David laughing] No,
just kidding. yeah, did. habit knocking wood things noticed
started to, sneak knocking wood every 'cause didn't want
people think often. started realize that, becoming
little bit reflex. saw incredible video Bence Olveczky's lab
Harvard. studies motor patterns. rats press different
sequences levers turn dials order get pellet food. that,
start introduce behaviors nothing actual lever
pressing, like start scratching hind quarters things like that. hat,
heads, excuse me, don't wear hats flipping ears. just like
pitcher throwing baseball. this, - Oh, yeah. - start incorporate
motor behaviors unrelated outcome, mind somehow starts think
necessary outcome. incorporate it. So, decided
break simply forcing not week. - Mm-hm. just
seemed like ridiculous, - [Both] thing do. Yeah, well- - Knock wood. - call
response prevention works. is, set new context
brain, get outcome want, devoid extraneous behavior. - Yeah,
knew nuts, right. knew illogical. - Right.

01:01:50 ‘Hypnotizability’, Spiegel Eye-roll Test



- somehow things take meaning. - [David] Right. - So, talked about,
utility hypnosis stress reduction, phobias, pain, possibly, don't know for,
things like ADHD OCD, just will depend hypnotizability. - Right. - talked
beautiful study the, metastatic breast cancer outcome patients.
Hypnotizability clearly key variable. - Yes. - please tell us,
hypnotizability is, evaluated Spiegel Eye-Roll Test is? - Okay,
sure. So, hypnotizability just capacity hypnotic experiences.
test called hypnotic conduction profile. give highly structured hypnotic
experience. old tradition clinical hypnosis was, try bunch
different things, talking, walking upstairs downstairs images time
say breathing subject that. change
clinician, less can make variation outcome. take
long time, know, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. just view kind complex,
not effective way assessing person's hypnotic capacity. know
peak period hypnotizability human life, latency years childhood. So,
every eight year old trance time. call 'em dinner, don't
hear ya, thing. childhood wonderful
experience. Work play thing. try make little
adults, think terrible mistake. Everything fun them. enjoy learning,
enjoy everything. - age this- - like 6 10, 6 11.
playful, enjoy everything. Everything sort game fun try
make miserable them, got it. when, Piaget called,
adult cognitive framework, learn abstract concepts, learn even one
bottle looks bigger other, can equal volume. so, imposing
logic, growing DLPFC point imposing cognitive structure
experience. people start lose hypnotic ability. time
early 20s, hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed. study done
Stanford, Ernest Hillard, Phil Zimbardo this, looking at, tracked
students psych one, hypnotizability measured retested
blindly 25 years later. test, retest correlation was, want guess
was? - guessing it's, don't know, 0.6 something. - Yeah, close. 0.7, IQ
0.6, 25 year interval. - Wow. - So, stable IQ 25
year interval. So, point, are. factors


lead that? Well, means that, third adults just
not hypnotizable. Two thirds are, 15% extremely hypnotizable can
measure give number 0 10. useful.
patients it, say, look, sorry, not hypnotizable going
something else. Medication, systematic desensitization, mindfulness, things
hypnotizable, just go it. don't lot explaining. People
low moderate hypnotizable, like explanations doing,
can still get benefits. So, helps guide nature treatment
people. Now, eye roll is, father used use eye fixation induction, used
say, look ceiling now close eyes looking up. very,
yes, very- - Yeah [indistinct] [laughs]. - noticed two patients back
back. one woman seen work with, hysterical seizures.
just suddenly start shaking. And- - Real epileptic seizures? - No, pseudo
epileptic seizures. - see, hysteria. - Hysteria, although people both,
the, people, real epilepsy becomes framework gets elaborated on,
stressed, seizures. just pseudo epilepsy, no EEG
abnormalities. really something watch. husband move
work bench near door, started seizure, run home
try help it. bad. noticed
did, looked up, one seizure events, see

New Yorker cartoon driver, comes yield sign yells, "Never!"
always [indistinct]. - sounds right, New Yorker. - Yeah, New
Yorker. so, guy, tried look up, couldn't keep eyes
closed them. so, father started testing people. seemed
rough correlation capacity keep eyes up, closed
measured hypnotizability. - people listening [stutters], watching


video. So, Spiegel Eye-Roll Test, involves looking ceiling. So, tilting
head back, tilting chin back looking ceiling now. also
directing eyes upward eyes open. eye roll test involves
then, closing eyelids eyes open. - open. - whether not,
eyes roll back said it, see sclera, white part. - see sclera,
white part. - means you're, hypnotizable moderately hypnotizable. -
Right. - Whereas eyes move see iris, colored part eye
eyes close, less hypnotizable. - Right. - can look online there, just
put Spiegel Eye-Roll Test find it. also going actual
example hypnosis video later. - Right. So, asking brain something
difficult, keep eyes closing eyelids. contradictory signals
third, fourth sixth cranial nerve nuclei control eye movement. - said
third- - Fourth six, - Yup. - cranial nerve nuclei. suspending one
activity, asking another eye movements lot levels

close eyes sleep, rapid eye movement dream.
drugs, affect level consciousness, can affect eyes eye movements,
either dilation contraction pupils, depending whether stimulant
opioid. - Stimulants, make pupils big. - Big, right? - Yeah. Like cocaine,
amphetamine. - Right, exactly. - Things sort. - opioids, get constricted
pupils. - parents looking kids coming door late night,
looking substance abuse. - right. - Yeah. - So, something
eyes lot level consciousness. mean, obviously, close
eyes go sleep, rapid eye movement dreaming.
So, not surprising. old Zen practice called, looking third eye.
think part reason happens is, looking inside like
third eye two forehead. think
visual creatures, pretty pathetic physical point view. Many animals

makes sense. - Sure. - But, signs locations built around, people's

interesting book history national parks says, didn't

to, close eyes period time, normally go


sleep not worried detecting risk threat. So, interesting state
turning inward, basically, looking up, shutting eyes
allowing whatever happens outside happen focusing
going inward. So, think signal brain turn inward. - interesting.
meditation course, done eyes open almost always done
eyes closed. - Yes, right. - interesting. So, can quickly determine
whether not someone highly hypnotizable. - Right. - not hypnotizable.
said two thirds people can hypnotized. - Right. - Obviously third cannot.
within two thirds can, range, said 15% people fall
this, highly hypnotizable category. - Right, correct. - seem member
of. - Yeah. - And, repeated use self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis, increase
change hypnotizability, can access first place? - say
general, may increase little bit, not hell lot, not worth effort
increase hypnotizability point. worth trying deal problem,
dealing with. So, can get better using level have.
study done tried train people hypnotizable
obviously, there're subjective behavioral components test, can learn
little better them. found reanalyze data,
account three times final score, based initial hypnotizability
measurement, rather whether not trained better. So,
can improve little

01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)

not worth trouble. - Got it. Along lines eyes eye movements, lot
interest EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. -
Shapiro working, wasn't Stanford directly, local
Stanford. - Yeah. - think Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - thoughts
EMDR? useful, think less useful? things
EMDR combined make useful? listeners podcast
come to, think, come podcast range backgrounds interests. me,
makes sense EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given newer
data can suppress amygdala activity animals animal models
humans well. really hasn't explored much, neurally. heard things like,


coordinates two sides brain, it, just throwaway. don't think
evidence that, coordinating two sides brain better not
coordinating. wouldn't speaking right now two sides brain, well
correlated. - Yeah. - language lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - heard
mimics, rapid eye movements sleep, actually doesn't. So, - Right. -
heard people talk positive experiences EMDR.
thoughts EMDR? - Yeah, good comment one recent
podcasts. tell you, one way sort think bemused point view,
old, mentioned earlier, oldest sort idea hypnotic induction,
dangling watch, right? [indistinct] watch. And, fact, enough concern
automobiles invented, movement prevent
installing windshield wipers people afraid hypnotized,
watched windshield wipers go back forth car. Now, turns
fortunately that, tend not look windshield wipers. keep looking
windshield. so, windshield wipers today. movement is,
exactly used hypnotic induction. think lot hypnosis EMDR. - Ah. -
think, combination exposure based treatments, use
EMDR think it. tend not process experience much just
physical part it, personally think drawback. And, every study seen
dismantling study. no question people go EMDR, many

things. So, tend think that, EMDR another form exposure based therapy
trauma, implied exception possible new data, certainly
doesn't with, rapid eye movement sleep. don't think moving eyes
issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put
weight this, going re-injure ankle example, simply mean
body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat
something coming opportunity something ameliorate situation. So,
not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding
happening. face also say, opportunity
something it. minute realistically enha- doesn't mean,
imagine away heart attack. means figure rehabilitate heart attack


broken leg something like way get much control

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body
floating, safe comfortable. Now, picture Mary sit feeling sadness
no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,
watch it, try [stutters]. work enjoying together shows
breathing patterns may increase sympathetic arousal may decrease. may
[indistinct] cyclic sighing seems to, actually, time spent exhaling
inhaling. reason believe induces parasympathetic activity,
'cause increasing pressure chest therefore allowing heart slow
blood returned atrium easily. use it. ask people
take deep breath part induction slowly exhale. partly
result research together, emphasizing slow exhale more, part
[stutters], enhance idea induction period relaxation, 'cause
think inducing perhaps perceiving well. So, no,
absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go
automatically can control it. so, kind way us demonstrate
ourselves, greater ways modulating internal state. So, can either it,
thinking it, way pain control hypnosis can
extent, taking charge breathing things will produce change
want see happen body. So, like right margin,
can enhance, me, like way augmenting hypnosis,
medication, think powerful way that. - Great, really excited see
goes. - Yes. - Breathing, vision, bodily states clearly the-
directed mental focus, seem key elements hypnosis. missing


ingredients? - Yeah, think right. - It's- - Breathing, vision, - Breathing, vision,
change vision don't, know, typically physically relaxed
state, frankly people peak performance, including physical athletic
performance musical performance hypnotic states too. talked
classical pianists say, not thinking, start thinking fingers
now, screw up. floating piano, thinking tone want
feel exuding instrument. hypnotic like state too. many athletes
peak performance, just flowing it. not thinking step step,
doing? best working
giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much
always you. can people learn about, can get
hypnotized? mentioned Reveri, put link it, R-E-V-E-R-I.com way
access that. - Reveri app app store, way. reveri.com
website, can get download Reveri app app
store. - Great. So, currently apple, hopefully soon, also Android,
meantime, people interested exploring clinical hypnosis, working
somebody similar? centralized resource people can go find, really
well-trained hypnotists? - two good professional organizations will help
that. One society clinical experimental hypnosis. think
sceh.us their- - Okay, look provide link. - American society
clinical hypnosis, provide referral services professionals. can look
up. just say general, look someone licensed trained
primary professional discipline, psychiatry, psychology, medicine, dentistry
training interest using hypnosis, way it. - Great one
question comment. question is, will psychiatrist? - [laughs]
honored. - tall task. might stubborn patient. - think hardest
work's already done, Andrew. - Thank you. - fine, now. - appreciate that.
[David laughing] Well, final thing comment. First all, thank much
today, sharing knowledge. - welcome. - hope can
again. - hope so. - love working laboratory you. -
Likewise [indistinct]. - speak, learn know others well. -
Thank you. - will put resources get also just want say, thank


work do. - Well, thank you. - incredible thing world
discovering much body works, mind still rather
mysterious people struggling lot things, also think people
really excited about, applying tools like hypnosis perform better, feel better mentally
physically. pointed us tremendous amount resources
tools work already demonstrated work. just, thank
you. know professional commitment life benefit. So, thank
so. - Well, thank you, real joy collaborating
using precision knowledge neuroanatomy, neurobiology
address problems often people disciplined primary
neurobiological end, aren't interested are. so, really pleasure
try bring together know different perspectives build
something neither us alone. so, real joy it. -
Thank you, honored.

didn't think would. so, realized one hand even worse
thought was. hand actually probably saved life.
so, way of, helping restructure experience trauma make
tolerable. helped her- didn't recog- couldn't identify guy,
helped restructure understand experience. something
can just talking, straight psychotherapy. sometimes can hell
lot faster efficiently using hypnosis. one randomized trial
Israel shows adding hypnosis PTSD treatment, actually improves
outcome. way accomplishing things understand broader
psychotherapy world, much quickly sometimes effectively. - Yeah,
sounds like going somewhat state one trying deal with,
dissociating state key. imagine, open
various podcasts. done lot analysis years. experienced
sessions, depending show them, might just get kind
laundry list happened opposed actually feeling anything, around
happened. - Right. - think people probably vary extent can
drop feeling states can depend day. can depend well
slept night on. - one thing might add, Andrew, - Yes. -
is, notion late Gordon Bower, just memorial Gordon
Stanford. died year ago. Brilliant cognitive psychologist, one founders
cognitive psychology Stanford great pitcher. almost became Major
League pitcher decided go grad school instead, glad did.
Gordon helped establish concept state dependent memory
certain mental state, enhance ability remember things it. sort
bad example drunk hides bottle can't remember
put gets drunk mental state. People go
dissociative states traumatized. way, hypnosis helping
remember deal memories better mental state
like happened. rape victims will tell you, floating
body, feeling sorry woman assaulted below. People traumatic
episodes, just say, know, blank out, don't know happening,
autopilot kind self hypnotic state. So, use hypnosis help
deal traumatic memory, making state in, right office
you, congruent state likely in, trauma happened.


think part helps facilitate treatment trauma related disorders. -
see.

00:45:14 Ketamine Therapy

makes ask, every question ask, 'cause really feel
almost like compulsion, dissociation traumatic episode is, part
adaptive strategy. - Right. - creates certain issues, creates problems, right?
something like ketamine, creates dissociative state, useful
treatment trauma? confused days colleague,
Karl Deisseroth, also podcast coworkers figured out,
okay, layer one networks neocortex, involved
dissociative state. starting gain understanding ketamine
works neural level. - Right. - seem, certain populations can
useful treatment. don't know, never tried it. don't know current status
is, legal. allowed least in, FDA approved use.
dissociative states useful element dissociation gave rise
trauma memory first place? - Well, yeah, Karl brilliant paper
nature he, rats humans one paper. showed
rhythmic discharge retrosplenial region, triggered ketamine.
rats actually showed dissociative like behavior, hot pad
ordinarily wouldn't didn't seem much pain paw.
male subject implanted electrodes- - Human, yeah. - human subject, yeah.
electrodes picked rhythmic activity. did,
report dissociative state. description was, like pilot
airplane. felt walking cockpit plane still flying
and- - sounds terrifying me. [David laughing] sounds terrify terrifying. -
thing- - want body, [David laughing] time, know. -
right but, point is, way principal, Andrew, like, principle said,
need re-confront traumatic situation can modulate associations
it. So, accept it, accept arousal, put boundaries around
figure can approach problem approach
problem different point view. So, not surprise- fact, studied,
people disassociated Loma Prieta earthquake Oakland-Berkeley


firestorm. - remember well. - Yeah. - Earthquakes follow me. move
south Northridge quake- - going keep away So, there'll one
later, afternoon. [David laughing] - starting dissociating. So, dissociation
compartmentalize experience, means point view treating trauma,
inhibition. don't engage it. like happened there. think
happens people, sometimes good able separate

00:50:07 Self-directed Hypnosis, Reveri

think years come, going become widespread along lines.
quickly, described examples people getting relief quickly. -
Right. - permanent, changes? need follow related
that, sure number people listening thinking, wonderful, love


get hypnotized number different things Dr. Spiegel somebody else expert
clinical hypnosis, might not access somebody similar
training. power? So, quickly work? long lasting
changes? then, necessary work clinical hypnotist? better
self-hypnosis forth? Maybe just give us contour
landscape directed self-directed treatment. - Well, typically, people
start coming see clinician like me. better see someone licensing
training professional discipline, medicine, psychology, dentistry, whatever. -
'Cause lot hypnotists there, just hypnotist. - Right. Just
hypnotists. - Oh, okay. - key issue is, somebody can really assess
problem make sure not, talking someone reducing chest
pain, rather getting coronary artery problem- - 'Cause real
issue there. - could, right. - hypnosis might adjust wouldn't deal
deeper underlying issue. - right. hand. typically use
people, often see twice periodically, not every week.
certainly not every day, pain problem hypnosis helpful pain.
so, is, identifying hypnotizable are. give standard

take one two minutes people can refresh reinforce. - Two minute hypnosis,
[indistinct] one minute. - Yes. - Yeah. - one two, one two minutes
now, finding two thirds people find even just one minute
refresher, helps feel better. reporting, feel better. So, nice thing is,
know right away, whether likely help not. found, done
studies, looking hypnosis pain relief acute medical procedures.

00:56:53 Eliminating Obsessive Thoughts, Superstitions

- Great, thanks clarification. hopefully, time both, get asked lot
obsessive thoughts intrusive thoughts. also get asked lot OCD.
evidence hypnosis self-hypnosis can used for, dealing obsessive
thoughts? - Sometimes, obsessional people, just turn not
hypnotizable for, yeah, not random. tend controlling
thought, busy evaluating rather experiencing, so- - know people
like that. [David laughing] sounds like adaptive mindset lot professions. -
right. - get trained that, - Yeah. - school, obsess
exam, obsess the, - Yeah. - social interactions. mean, part
becoming functional human being. yet, can take us different- -
sometimes overdo it. mean, tell one example extreme situations, that,
know, judging, evaluating, not letting experience, including
emotionally. know somebody, listens tapes airplanes go down. So,
get black box listen it. said me, know- -
profession recreational- - No, profession. - Okay. -
did. 'Cause trying accident prevention handle things.
said worry people panicking, right? guys know
got 30 seconds 45 seconds just going
checklist. said, don't panic enough. taught do.
reason, good reason it. sometimes overdo it. painful
listen 'cause know going happen. So, kind balance
hit. sometimes get emotional absorbed not
enough sort see possibilities. can problem.
hand, sometimes rigid controlled don't let emotions guide
need protect protect others. So, say


general people OCD are, less hypnotizable side spectrum,
less likely allow engage any, typical example checking
OCD example, don't remember, whether locked door turned off
gas oven keep going back keep checking. So,
evaluative component brain, kind overrides experiential one sometimes
people can get benefit, not group select
likely respond self hypnotic approaches. - superstitions similar? -
Superstitions, think more, people hypnotizable, keep
getting caught things like superstitions there, imagination supplants
reality. seen lot happening recently. think there,
possible helped learning sort see put context, see
different point view. - developed pretty vicious superstition,
college hard break, actually. always feel, talk clinicians,
reveal certain things pathology. - Please do. - so- - get
bill later. - Thank you, yes, part reason arranged this. [David laughing] No,
just kidding. yeah, did. habit knocking wood things noticed
started to, sneak knocking wood every 'cause didn't want
people think often. started realize that, becoming
little bit reflex. saw incredible video Bence Olveczky's lab
Harvard. studies motor patterns. rats press different
sequences levers turn dials order get pellet food. that,
start introduce behaviors nothing actual lever
pressing, like start scratching hind quarters things like that. hat,
heads, excuse me, don't wear hats flipping ears. just like
pitcher throwing baseball. this, - Oh, yeah. - start incorporate
motor behaviors unrelated outcome, mind somehow starts think
necessary outcome. incorporate it. So, decided
break simply forcing not week. - Mm-hm. just
seemed like ridiculous, - [Both] thing do. Yeah, well- - Knock wood. - call
response prevention works. is, set new context
brain, get outcome want, devoid extraneous behavior. - Yeah,
knew nuts, right. knew illogical. - Right.

01:01:50 ‘Hypnotizability’, Spiegel Eye-roll Test



- somehow things take meaning. - [David] Right. - So, talked about,
utility hypnosis stress reduction, phobias, pain, possibly, don't know for,
things like ADHD OCD, just will depend hypnotizability. - Right. - talked
beautiful study the, metastatic breast cancer outcome patients.
Hypnotizability clearly key variable. - Yes. - please tell us,
hypnotizability is, evaluated Spiegel Eye-Roll Test is? - Okay,
sure. So, hypnotizability just capacity hypnotic experiences.
test called hypnotic conduction profile. give highly structured hypnotic
experience. old tradition clinical hypnosis was, try bunch
different things, talking, walking upstairs downstairs images time
say breathing subject that. change
clinician, less can make variation outcome. take
long time, know, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. just view kind complex,
not effective way assessing person's hypnotic capacity. know
peak period hypnotizability human life, latency years childhood. So,
every eight year old trance time. call 'em dinner, don't
hear ya, thing. childhood wonderful
experience. Work play thing. try make little
adults, think terrible mistake. Everything fun them. enjoy learning,
enjoy everything. - age this- - like 6 10, 6 11.
playful, enjoy everything. Everything sort game fun try
make miserable them, got it. when, Piaget called,
adult cognitive framework, learn abstract concepts, learn even one
bottle looks bigger other, can equal volume. so, imposing
logic, growing DLPFC point imposing cognitive structure
experience. people start lose hypnotic ability. time
early 20s, hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed. study done
Stanford, Ernest Hillard, Phil Zimbardo this, looking at, tracked
students psych one, hypnotizability measured retested
blindly 25 years later. test, retest correlation was, want guess
was? - guessing it's, don't know, 0.6 something. - Yeah, close. 0.7, IQ
0.6, 25 year interval. - Wow. - So, stable IQ 25
year interval. So, point, are. factors


lead that? Well, means that, third adults just
not hypnotizable. Two thirds are, 15% extremely hypnotizable can
measure give number 0 10. useful.
patients it, say, look, sorry, not hypnotizable going
something else. Medication, systematic desensitization, mindfulness, things
hypnotizable, just go it. don't lot explaining. People
low moderate hypnotizable, like explanations doing,
can still get benefits. So, helps guide nature treatment
people. Now, eye roll is, father used use eye fixation induction, used
say, look ceiling now close eyes looking up. very,
yes, very- - Yeah [indistinct] [laughs]. - noticed two patients back
back. one woman seen work with, hysterical seizures.
just suddenly start shaking. And- - Real epileptic seizures? - No, pseudo
epileptic seizures. - see, hysteria. - Hysteria, although people both,
the, people, real epilepsy becomes framework gets elaborated on,
stressed, seizures. just pseudo epilepsy, no EEG
abnormalities. really something watch. husband move
work bench near door, started seizure, run home
try help it. bad. noticed
did, looked up, one seizure events, see
sclera, don't see Iris anymore. start seize. great thing
her. taught seizures. Everybody else telling stop.
made one. hypnotized her, [indistinct] go back last time
one sure enough, start shake. gradually make smaller
smaller. So, learning control, access, like
PTSD, confront, don't avoid it, don't suppress it. confront figure
deal it. next patient rigid obsessional businessman
wanted stop controlling [chuckles], reminded me,
New Yorker cartoon driver, comes yield sign yells, "Never!"
always [indistinct]. - sounds right, New Yorker. - Yeah, New
Yorker. so, guy, tried look up, couldn't keep eyes
closed them. so, father started testing people. seemed
rough correlation capacity keep eyes up, closed
measured hypnotizability. - people listening [stutters], watching


video. So, Spiegel Eye-Roll Test, involves looking ceiling. So, tilting
head back, tilting chin back looking ceiling now. also
directing eyes upward eyes open. eye roll test involves
then, closing eyelids eyes open. - open. - whether not,
eyes roll back said it, see sclera, white part. - see sclera,
white part. - means you're, hypnotizable moderately hypnotizable. -
Right. - Whereas eyes move see iris, colored part eye
eyes close, less hypnotizable. - Right. - can look online there, just
put Spiegel Eye-Roll Test find it. also going actual
example hypnosis video later. - Right. So, asking brain something
difficult, keep eyes closing eyelids. contradictory signals
third, fourth sixth cranial nerve nuclei control eye movement. - said
third- - Fourth six, - Yup. - cranial nerve nuclei. suspending one
activity, asking another eye movements lot levels
consciousness. periaqueductal gray, surrounds cranial nerve nuclei.
close eyes sleep, rapid eye movement dream.
drugs, affect level consciousness, can affect eyes eye movements,
either dilation contraction pupils, depending whether stimulant
opioid. - Stimulants, make pupils big. - Big, right? - Yeah. Like cocaine,
amphetamine. - Right, exactly. - Things sort. - opioids, get constricted
pupils. - parents looking kids coming door late night,
looking substance abuse. - right. - Yeah. - So, something
eyes lot level consciousness. mean, obviously, close
eyes go sleep, rapid eye movement dreaming.
So, not surprising. old Zen practice called, looking third eye.
think part reason happens is, looking inside like
third eye two forehead. think
visual creatures, pretty pathetic physical point view. Many animals
can outrun us, outs smell us eagles read newsprint hundred yards
can't. So, major defensive sensory input vision. animals,
predator animals eyes front head, good,
detailed vision prey. Whereas prey animals like deer, eyes side
head. So, don't see things well, much bigger range potential
see threat. mainly use, fact, interesting, social


anthropologists say, gather do, coastlines edge
forest something, got protection back. Something can
attack one side big vision might threaten you.
tend attracted kinds physical situations, so- - Yeah, love vistas. -
love vistas, right. - Vistas calming. take us panoramic
vision. - right. - didn't know this, turns scenic spots
location national parks people naturally aggregated was-
makes sense. - Sure. - But, signs locations built around, people's
tendency animals tendencies. - Oh, really [indistinct]? - aggregate there. Yeah,
interesting book history national parks says, didn't
give research study support it, no Google Maps, obviously. -
interesting. - Yeah, panorama visual boundaries really interesting. think,
eyes, know, two pieces central nervous system brain,
outside the- - Right. used say eyes outside skull neuro-
ophthalmologist wrote vehemently pointed outside
cranial vault, so, know. outside cranial vault two pieces
brain there. so, mentioned cranial nerves, three, four six.
isn't neuroanatomy course maybe go little deeper there. So, said
contradictory activity, looking controlled one set cranial nerves.
closing eyelids, controlled another cranial nerve. - No,
one. think six close eyes, activate, no, facial,
guess facial nerve. 7, yeah. - 7, yeah. - looking up, activating
muscles force eyes look up. closing eyelids normally relaxes
those, relaxes upper movement, eyes closed don't
need it. breaking usual customary pattern. - like rubbing the, -
Right. - hey, can't even it, see like the, - Right. [Andrew David laughing] -
exactly right. - Rubbing tummy patting head. bit
conflict there, - Right. - clinically, good probe you, - has. -
father. So, Spiegel senior Spiegel junior? - Spiegel senior. -
developed Spiegel Eye-Roll Test. - key issue this, normally
close eyes also, going sleep. not worried going
world anymore. Here, maintaining resting alertness. So, focusing
turning inward. unusual state. Normally close eyes periodically,
to, close eyes period time, normally go


sleep not worried detecting risk threat. So, interesting state
turning inward, basically, looking up, shutting eyes
allowing whatever happens outside happen focusing
going inward. So, think signal brain turn inward. - interesting.
meditation course, done eyes open almost always done
eyes closed. - Yes, right. - interesting. So, can quickly determine
whether not someone highly hypnotizable. - Right. - not hypnotizable.
said two thirds people can hypnotized. - Right. - Obviously third cannot.
within two thirds can, range, said 15% people fall
this, highly hypnotizable category. - Right, correct. - seem member
of. - Yeah. - And, repeated use self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis, increase
change hypnotizability, can access first place? - say
general, may increase little bit, not hell lot, not worth effort
increase hypnotizability point. worth trying deal problem,
dealing with. So, can get better using level have.
study done tried train people hypnotizable
obviously, there're subjective behavioral components test, can learn
little better them. found reanalyze data,
account three times final score, based initial hypnotizability
measurement, rather whether not trained better. So,
can improve little

01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)

not worth trouble. - Got it. Along lines eyes eye movements, lot
interest EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. -
Shapiro working, wasn't Stanford directly, local
Stanford. - Yeah. - think Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - thoughts
EMDR? useful, think less useful? things
EMDR combined make useful? listeners podcast
come to, think, come podcast range backgrounds interests. me,
makes sense EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given newer
data can suppress amygdala activity animals animal models
humans well. really hasn't explored much, neurally. heard things like,


coordinates two sides brain, it, just throwaway. don't think
evidence that, coordinating two sides brain better not
coordinating. wouldn't speaking right now two sides brain, well
correlated. - Yeah. - language lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - heard
mimics, rapid eye movements sleep, actually doesn't. So, - Right. -
heard people talk positive experiences EMDR.
thoughts EMDR? - Yeah, good comment one recent
podcasts. tell you, one way sort think bemused point view,
old, mentioned earlier, oldest sort idea hypnotic induction,
dangling watch, right? [indistinct] watch. And, fact, enough concern
automobiles invented, movement prevent
installing windshield wipers people afraid hypnotized,
watched windshield wipers go back forth car. Now, turns
fortunately that, tend not look windshield wipers. keep looking
windshield. so, windshield wipers today. movement is,
exactly used hypnotic induction. think lot hypnosis EMDR. - Ah. -
think, combination exposure based treatments, use
EMDR think it. tend not process experience much just
physical part it, personally think drawback. And, every study seen
dismantling study. no question people go EMDR, many
get better trauma related problems VA big program using
on. every program dismantled, going treatment
lateral eye movement, shown lateral eye movement, doesn't add
anything it. toward end career, Francine [indistinct]

things. So, tend think that, EMDR another form exposure based therapy
trauma, implied exception possible new data, certainly
doesn't with, rapid eye movement sleep. don't think moving eyes
issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put
weight this, going re-injure ankle example, simply mean
body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat
something coming opportunity something ameliorate situation. So,
not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding
happening. face also say, opportunity
something it. minute realistically enha- doesn't mean,
imagine away heart attack. means figure rehabilitate heart attack


broken leg something like way get much control

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body
floating, safe comfortable. Now, picture Mary sit feeling sadness
no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,
watch it, try [stutters]. work enjoying together shows
breathing patterns may increase sympathetic arousal may decrease. may

absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go
automatically can control it. so, kind way us demonstrate
ourselves, greater ways modulating internal state. So, can either it,
thinking it, way pain control hypnosis can

want see happen body. So, like right margin,
can enhance, me, like way augmenting hypnosis,
medication, think powerful way that. - Great, really excited see
goes. - Yes. - Breathing, vision, bodily states clearly the-
directed mental focus, seem key elements hypnosis. missing


ingredients? - Yeah, think right. - It's- - Breathing, vision, - Breathing, vision,
change vision don't, know, typically physically relaxed

performance musical performance hypnotic states too. talked
classical pianists say, not thinking, start thinking fingers
now, screw up. floating piano, thinking tone want
feel exuding instrument. hypnotic like state too. many athletes
peak performance, just flowing it. not thinking step step,
doing? best working
giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much
always you. can people learn about, can get
hypnotized? mentioned Reveri, put link it, R-E-V-E-R-I.com way
access that. - Reveri app app store, way. reveri.com
website, can get download Reveri app app
store. - Great. So, currently apple, hopefully soon, also Android,
meantime, people interested exploring clinical hypnosis, working
somebody similar? centralized resource people can go find, really
well-trained hypnotists? - two good professional organizations will help
that. One society clinical experimental hypnosis. think
sceh.us their- - Okay, look provide link. - American society
clinical hypnosis, provide referral services professionals. can look
up. just say general, look someone licensed trained
primary professional discipline, psychiatry, psychology, medicine, dentistry
training interest using hypnosis, way it. - Great one
question comment. question is, will psychiatrist? - [laughs]
honored. - tall task. might stubborn patient. - think hardest
work's already done, Andrew. - Thank you. - fine, now. - appreciate that.
[David laughing] Well, final thing comment. First all, thank much
today, sharing knowledge. - welcome. - hope can
again. - hope so. - love working laboratory you. -
Likewise [indistinct]. - speak, learn know others well. -
Thank you. - will put resources get also just want say, thank


work do. - Well, thank you. - incredible thing world
discovering much body works, mind still rather
mysterious people struggling lot things, also think people
really excited about, applying tools like hypnosis perform better, feel better mentally
physically. pointed us tremendous amount resources
tools work already demonstrated work. just, thank
you. know professional commitment life benefit. So, thank
so. - Well, thank you, real joy collaborating
using precision knowledge neuroanatomy, neurobiology
address problems often people disciplined primary
neurobiological end, aren't interested are. so, really pleasure
try bring together know different perspectives build
something neither us alone. so, real joy it. -

00:45:14 Ketamine Therapy

makes ask, every question ask, 'cause really feel
almost like compulsion, dissociation traumatic episode is, part
adaptive strategy. - Right. - creates certain issues, creates problems, right?
something like ketamine, creates dissociative state, useful
treatment trauma? confused days colleague,
Karl Deisseroth, also podcast coworkers figured out,
okay, layer one networks neocortex, involved
dissociative state. starting gain understanding ketamine
works neural level. - Right. - seem, certain populations can
useful treatment. don't know, never tried it. don't know current status
is, legal. allowed least in, FDA approved use.
dissociative states useful element dissociation gave rise
trauma memory first place? - Well, yeah, Karl brilliant paper
nature he, rats humans one paper. showed
rhythmic discharge retrosplenial region, triggered ketamine.
rats actually showed dissociative like behavior, hot pad
ordinarily wouldn't didn't seem much pain paw.
male subject implanted electrodes- - Human, yeah. - human subject, yeah.
electrodes picked rhythmic activity. did,
report dissociative state. description was, like pilot
airplane. felt walking cockpit plane still flying
and- - sounds terrifying me. [David laughing] sounds terrify terrifying. -
thing- - want body, [David laughing] time, know. -
right but, point is, way principal, Andrew, like, principle said,
need re-confront traumatic situation can modulate associations
it. So, accept it, accept arousal, put boundaries around
figure can approach problem approach
problem different point view. So, not surprise- fact, studied,
people disassociated Loma Prieta earthquake Oakland-Berkeley


firestorm. - remember well. - Yeah. - Earthquakes follow me. move
south Northridge quake- - going keep away So, there'll one
later, afternoon. [David laughing] - starting dissociating. So, dissociation
compartmentalize experience, means point view treating trauma,
inhibition. don't engage it. like happened there. think

one reason ketamine might work fact, allows keep, re-approach
dissociative experience way can start think something

something can make happen. can control it, can something it. So,

breathing paper anticipation breathing. not whether breathe, inhale

really upsetting, understandably. so, issue control hypnosis,
terrible reputation taking away control actually superb way enhancing
control mind body. - love reminds naming important.
almost wonder self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis called something
else, would've separated stage hypnosis way make
less scary, weird, complicated people embrace. But, - Yeah. - part reason
discussion is, great experiences hypnosis, seen
data, talking lot clinical examples. incredibly powerful boils
right neural brain states. - Right. - And,

00:50:07 Self-directed Hypnosis, Reveri

think years come, going become widespread along lines.
quickly, described examples people getting relief quickly. -
Right. - permanent, changes? need follow related
that, sure number people listening thinking, wonderful, love


get hypnotized number different things Dr. Spiegel somebody else expert
clinical hypnosis, might not access somebody similar
training. power? So, quickly work? long lasting
changes? then, necessary work clinical hypnotist? better
self-hypnosis forth? Maybe just give us contour
landscape directed self-directed treatment. - Well, typically, people
start coming see clinician like me. better see someone licensing
training professional discipline, medicine, psychology, dentistry, whatever. -
'Cause lot hypnotists there, just hypnotist. - Right. Just
hypnotists. - Oh, okay. - key issue is, somebody can really assess
problem make sure not, talking someone reducing chest
pain, rather getting coronary artery problem- - 'Cause real
issue there. - could, right. - hypnosis might adjust wouldn't deal
deeper underlying issue. - right. hand. typically use
people, often see twice periodically, not every week.
certainly not every day, pain problem hypnosis helpful pain.
so, is, identifying hypnotizable are. give standard
brief test ability experience hypnosis, going self-hypnosis
exercise deal problem, seeing respond it,
teaching themselves. old days, used use
iPhone record part session. play back hypnosis
experience. Now developed app, "Reveri," can teach people step
through, dealing pain, stress, focus, insomnia help people eat better
stop smoking. elements take 15 minutes elements just
take one two minutes people can refresh reinforce. - Two minute hypnosis,
[indistinct] one minute. - Yes. - Yeah. - one two, one two minutes
now, finding two thirds people find even just one minute
refresher, helps feel better. reporting, feel better. So, nice thing is,
know right away, whether likely help not. found, done
studies, looking hypnosis pain relief acute medical procedures.
randomized trial published Lancet, three conditions, people getting
arterial cutdowns chemoembolized tumors liver visualize renal artery
stenosis. don't use general anesthesia this. uncomfortable people
anxious three conditions. One standard care, push


button get opioids, IV. - surgery? - surgery. second

pleasant attention support. third was, taught self-hypnosis
pain control. So, feeling, can change temperature, body
cool, tingling, numb, floating ice water feeling comfortable. go

found that, two half hour procedure, hour half,

took 17 minutes less time average get done. not patient
relaxed. treatment staff. weren't dealing someone
struggling uncomfortable. measured anxiety thing.
hypnosis group, worried dead. no anxiety hour
half, saying, fine, know, fine. standard care
group, 5 10 anxiety scores point. So, published Lancet,
big randomized trial. drug that, every hospital country
using now, no industry push it. So, part helped us decide
needed help people, Reveri teach
provide interactive support it. it, question, although is,
work long term? 'Cause can acutely doesn't necessarily carry on. So,
around randomized trial women metastatic breast cancer.

felt fine. So, works becomes skill people acquire, can
tell right away, whether likely help them, working clinician now using
app ways helping learn use skill. So, nice thing will
know quickly, whether likely help not. is, can learn
yourself. - great will, again, there'll link Reveri caption,

think that, mentioned, medications approaches dealing
problems quite expensive, potential side effects things. Not

don't want people disappointed looking Android,
agenda don't moment.

00:56:53 Eliminating Obsessive Thoughts, Superstitions

- Great, thanks clarification. hopefully, time both, get asked lot
obsessive thoughts intrusive thoughts. also get asked lot OCD.
evidence hypnosis self-hypnosis can used for, dealing obsessive
thoughts? - Sometimes, obsessional people, just turn not
hypnotizable for, yeah, not random. tend controlling
thought, busy evaluating rather experiencing, so- - know people
like that. [David laughing] sounds like adaptive mindset lot professions. -
right. - get trained that, - Yeah. - school, obsess
exam, obsess the, - Yeah. - social interactions. mean, part
becoming functional human being. yet, can take us different- -
sometimes overdo it. mean, tell one example extreme situations, that,
know, judging, evaluating, not letting experience, including
emotionally. know somebody, listens tapes airplanes go down. So,
get black box listen it. said me, know- -
profession recreational- - No, profession. - Okay. -
did. 'Cause trying accident prevention handle things.
said worry people panicking, right? guys know
got 30 seconds 45 seconds just going
checklist. said, don't panic enough. taught do.
reason, good reason it. sometimes overdo it. painful
listen 'cause know going happen. So, kind balance
hit. sometimes get emotional absorbed not
enough sort see possibilities. can problem.
hand, sometimes rigid controlled don't let emotions guide
need protect protect others. So, say


general people OCD are, less hypnotizable side spectrum,
less likely allow engage any, typical example checking
OCD example, don't remember, whether locked door turned off
gas oven keep going back keep checking. So,
evaluative component brain, kind overrides experiential one sometimes
people can get benefit, not group select
likely respond self hypnotic approaches. - superstitions similar? -
Superstitions, think more, people hypnotizable, keep
getting caught things like superstitions there, imagination supplants
reality. seen lot happening recently. think there,
possible helped learning sort see put context, see
different point view. - developed pretty vicious superstition,
college hard break, actually. always feel, talk clinicians,
reveal certain things pathology. - Please do. - so- - get
bill later. - Thank you, yes, part reason arranged this. [David laughing] No,
just kidding. yeah, did. habit knocking wood things noticed
started to, sneak knocking wood every 'cause didn't want
people think often. started realize that, becoming
little bit reflex. saw incredible video Bence Olveczky's lab
Harvard. studies motor patterns. rats press different
sequences levers turn dials order get pellet food. that,
start introduce behaviors nothing actual lever
pressing, like start scratching hind quarters things like that. hat,
heads, excuse me, don't wear hats flipping ears. just like
pitcher throwing baseball. this, - Oh, yeah. - start incorporate
motor behaviors unrelated outcome, mind somehow starts think
necessary outcome. incorporate it. So, decided
break simply forcing not week. - Mm-hm. just
seemed like ridiculous, - [Both] thing do. Yeah, well- - Knock wood. - call
response prevention works. is, set new context
brain, get outcome want, devoid extraneous behavior. - Yeah,
knew nuts, right. knew illogical. - Right.

01:01:50 ‘Hypnotizability’, Spiegel Eye-roll Test



- somehow things take meaning. - [David] Right. - So, talked about,
utility hypnosis stress reduction, phobias, pain, possibly, don't know for,
things like ADHD OCD, just will depend hypnotizability. - Right. - talked
beautiful study the, metastatic breast cancer outcome patients.
Hypnotizability clearly key variable. - Yes. - please tell us,
hypnotizability is, evaluated Spiegel Eye-Roll Test is? - Okay,
sure. So, hypnotizability just capacity hypnotic experiences.
test called hypnotic conduction profile. give highly structured hypnotic
experience. old tradition clinical hypnosis was, try bunch
different things, talking, walking upstairs downstairs images time
say breathing subject that. change
clinician, less can make variation outcome. take
long time, know, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. just view kind complex,
not effective way assessing person's hypnotic capacity. know
peak period hypnotizability human life, latency years childhood. So,
every eight year old trance time. call 'em dinner, don't
hear ya, thing. childhood wonderful
experience. Work play thing. try make little
adults, think terrible mistake. Everything fun them. enjoy learning,
enjoy everything. - age this- - like 6 10, 6 11.
playful, enjoy everything. Everything sort game fun try
make miserable them, got it. when, Piaget called,
adult cognitive framework, learn abstract concepts, learn even one
bottle looks bigger other, can equal volume. so, imposing
logic, growing DLPFC point imposing cognitive structure
experience. people start lose hypnotic ability. time
early 20s, hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed. study done
Stanford, Ernest Hillard, Phil Zimbardo this, looking at, tracked
students psych one, hypnotizability measured retested
blindly 25 years later. test, retest correlation was, want guess
was? - guessing it's, don't know, 0.6 something. - Yeah, close. 0.7, IQ
0.6, 25 year interval. - Wow. - So, stable IQ 25
year interval. So, point, are. factors


lead that? Well, means that, third adults just
not hypnotizable. Two thirds are, 15% extremely hypnotizable can
measure give number 0 10. useful.
patients it, say, look, sorry, not hypnotizable going
something else. Medication, systematic desensitization, mindfulness, things
hypnotizable, just go it. don't lot explaining. People
low moderate hypnotizable, like explanations doing,
can still get benefits. So, helps guide nature treatment
people. Now, eye roll is, father used use eye fixation induction, used
say, look ceiling now close eyes looking up. very,
yes, very- - Yeah [indistinct] [laughs]. - noticed two patients back
back. one woman seen work with, hysterical seizures.
just suddenly start shaking. And- - Real epileptic seizures? - No, pseudo
epileptic seizures. - see, hysteria. - Hysteria, although people both,
the, people, real epilepsy becomes framework gets elaborated on,
stressed, seizures. just pseudo epilepsy, no EEG
abnormalities. really something watch. husband move
work bench near door, started seizure, run home
try help it. bad. noticed
did, looked up, one seizure events, see
sclera, don't see Iris anymore. start seize. great thing
her. taught seizures. Everybody else telling stop.
made one. hypnotized her, [indistinct] go back last time
one sure enough, start shake. gradually make smaller
smaller. So, learning control, access, like
PTSD, confront, don't avoid it, don't suppress it. confront figure
deal it. next patient rigid obsessional businessman
wanted stop controlling [chuckles], reminded me,
New Yorker cartoon driver, comes yield sign yells, "Never!"
always [indistinct]. - sounds right, New Yorker. - Yeah, New
Yorker. so, guy, tried look up, couldn't keep eyes
closed them. so, father started testing people. seemed
rough correlation capacity keep eyes up, closed
measured hypnotizability. - people listening [stutters], watching


video. So, Spiegel Eye-Roll Test, involves looking ceiling. So, tilting
head back, tilting chin back looking ceiling now. also
directing eyes upward eyes open. eye roll test involves
then, closing eyelids eyes open. - open. - whether not,
eyes roll back said it, see sclera, white part. - see sclera,
white part. - means you're, hypnotizable moderately hypnotizable. -
Right. - Whereas eyes move see iris, colored part eye
eyes close, less hypnotizable. - Right. - can look online there, just
put Spiegel Eye-Roll Test find it. also going actual
example hypnosis video later. - Right. So, asking brain something
difficult, keep eyes closing eyelids. contradictory signals
third, fourth sixth cranial nerve nuclei control eye movement. - said
third- - Fourth six, - Yup. - cranial nerve nuclei. suspending one
activity, asking another eye movements lot levels
consciousness. periaqueductal gray, surrounds cranial nerve nuclei.
close eyes sleep, rapid eye movement dream.
drugs, affect level consciousness, can affect eyes eye movements,
either dilation contraction pupils, depending whether stimulant
opioid. - Stimulants, make pupils big. - Big, right? - Yeah. Like cocaine,
amphetamine. - Right, exactly. - Things sort. - opioids, get constricted
pupils. - parents looking kids coming door late night,
looking substance abuse. - right. - Yeah. - So, something
eyes lot level consciousness. mean, obviously, close
eyes go sleep, rapid eye movement dreaming.
So, not surprising. old Zen practice called, looking third eye.
think part reason happens is, looking inside like
third eye two forehead. think
visual creatures, pretty pathetic physical point view. Many animals
can outrun us, outs smell us eagles read newsprint hundred yards
can't. So, major defensive sensory input vision. animals,
predator animals eyes front head, good,
detailed vision prey. Whereas prey animals like deer, eyes side
head. So, don't see things well, much bigger range potential
see threat. mainly use, fact, interesting, social


anthropologists say, gather do, coastlines edge
forest something, got protection back. Something can
attack one side big vision might threaten you.
tend attracted kinds physical situations, so- - Yeah, love vistas. -
love vistas, right. - Vistas calming. take us panoramic
vision. - right. - didn't know this, turns scenic spots
location national parks people naturally aggregated was-
makes sense. - Sure. - But, signs locations built around, people's
tendency animals tendencies. - Oh, really [indistinct]? - aggregate there. Yeah,
interesting book history national parks says, didn't
give research study support it, no Google Maps, obviously. -
interesting. - Yeah, panorama visual boundaries really interesting. think,
eyes, know, two pieces central nervous system brain,
outside the- - Right. used say eyes outside skull neuro-
ophthalmologist wrote vehemently pointed outside
cranial vault, so, know. outside cranial vault two pieces
brain there. so, mentioned cranial nerves, three, four six.
isn't neuroanatomy course maybe go little deeper there. So, said
contradictory activity, looking controlled one set cranial nerves.
closing eyelids, controlled another cranial nerve. - No,
one. think six close eyes, activate, no, facial,
guess facial nerve. 7, yeah. - 7, yeah. - looking up, activating
muscles force eyes look up. closing eyelids normally relaxes
those, relaxes upper movement, eyes closed don't
need it. breaking usual customary pattern. - like rubbing the, -
Right. - hey, can't even it, see like the, - Right. [Andrew David laughing] -
exactly right. - Rubbing tummy patting head. bit
conflict there, - Right. - clinically, good probe you, - has. -
father. So, Spiegel senior Spiegel junior? - Spiegel senior. -
developed Spiegel Eye-Roll Test. - key issue this, normally
close eyes also, going sleep. not worried going
world anymore. Here, maintaining resting alertness. So, focusing
turning inward. unusual state. Normally close eyes periodically,
to, close eyes period time, normally go


sleep not worried detecting risk threat. So, interesting state
turning inward, basically, looking up, shutting eyes
allowing whatever happens outside happen focusing
going inward. So, think signal brain turn inward. - interesting.
meditation course, done eyes open almost always done
eyes closed. - Yes, right. - interesting. So, can quickly determine
whether not someone highly hypnotizable. - Right. - not hypnotizable.
said two thirds people can hypnotized. - Right. - Obviously third cannot.
within two thirds can, range, said 15% people fall
this, highly hypnotizable category. - Right, correct. - seem member
of. - Yeah. - And, repeated use self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis, increase
change hypnotizability, can access first place? - say
general, may increase little bit, not hell lot, not worth effort
increase hypnotizability point. worth trying deal problem,
dealing with. So, can get better using level have.
study done tried train people hypnotizable
obviously, there're subjective behavioral components test, can learn
little better them. found reanalyze data,
account three times final score, based initial hypnotizability
measurement, rather whether not trained better. So,
can improve little

01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)

not worth trouble. - Got it. Along lines eyes eye movements, lot
interest EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. -
Shapiro working, wasn't Stanford directly, local
Stanford. - Yeah. - think Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - thoughts
EMDR? useful, think less useful? things
EMDR combined make useful? listeners podcast
come to, think, come podcast range backgrounds interests. me,
makes sense EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given newer
data can suppress amygdala activity animals animal models
humans well. really hasn't explored much, neurally. heard things like,


coordinates two sides brain, it, just throwaway. don't think
evidence that, coordinating two sides brain better not
coordinating. wouldn't speaking right now two sides brain, well
correlated. - Yeah. - language lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - heard
mimics, rapid eye movements sleep, actually doesn't. So, - Right. -
heard people talk positive experiences EMDR.
thoughts EMDR? - Yeah, good comment one recent
podcasts. tell you, one way sort think bemused point view,
old, mentioned earlier, oldest sort idea hypnotic induction,
dangling watch, right? [indistinct] watch. And, fact, enough concern
automobiles invented, movement prevent
installing windshield wipers people afraid hypnotized,
watched windshield wipers go back forth car. Now, turns
fortunately that, tend not look windshield wipers. keep looking
windshield. so, windshield wipers today. movement is,
exactly used hypnotic induction. think lot hypnosis EMDR. - Ah. -
think, combination exposure based treatments, use
EMDR think it. tend not process experience much just
physical part it, personally think drawback. And, every study seen
dismantling study. no question people go EMDR, many
get better trauma related problems VA big program using
on. every program dismantled, going treatment
lateral eye movement, shown lateral eye movement, doesn't add
anything it. toward end career, Francine [indistinct]
contralateral touching something, wasn't eye movements anymore.
things. So, tend think that, EMDR another form exposure based therapy
trauma, implied exception possible new data, certainly
doesn't with, rapid eye movement sleep. don't think moving eyes
issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put
weight this, going re-injure ankle example, simply mean
body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat
something coming opportunity something ameliorate situation. So,
not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding
happening. face also say, opportunity
something it. minute realistically enha- doesn't mean,
imagine away heart attack. means figure rehabilitate heart attack


broken leg something like way get much control

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body
floating, safe comfortable. Now, picture Mary sit feeling sadness
no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,
watch it, try [stutters]. work enjoying together shows
breathing patterns may increase sympathetic arousal may decrease. may

absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go

thinking it, way pain control hypnosis can

ingredients? - Yeah, think right. - It's- - Breathing, vision, - Breathing, vision,
change vision don't, know, typically physically relaxed

feel exuding instrument. hypnotic like state too. many athletes
peak performance, just flowing it. not thinking step step,
doing? best working
giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much
always you. can people learn about, can get
hypnotized? mentioned Reveri, put link it, R-E-V-E-R-I.com way

meantime, people interested exploring clinical hypnosis, working
somebody similar? centralized resource people can go find, really

[David laughing] Well, final thing comment. First all, thank much
today, sharing knowledge. - welcome. - hope can

Likewise [indistinct]. - speak, learn know others well. -
Thank you. - will put resources get also just want say, thank

almost wonder self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis called something
else, would've separated stage hypnosis way make
less scary, weird, complicated people embrace. But, - Yeah. - part reason

right neural brain states. - Right. - And,

00:50:07 Self-directed Hypnosis, Reveri

think years come, going become widespread along lines.
quickly, described examples people getting relief quickly. -
Right. - permanent, changes? need follow related
that, sure number people listening thinking, wonderful, love


get hypnotized number different things Dr. Spiegel somebody else expert
clinical hypnosis, might not access somebody similar
training. power? So, quickly work? long lasting
changes? then, necessary work clinical hypnotist? better
self-hypnosis forth? Maybe just give us contour
landscape directed self-directed treatment. - Well, typically, people
start coming see clinician like me. better see someone licensing
training professional discipline, medicine, psychology, dentistry, whatever. -
'Cause lot hypnotists there, just hypnotist. - Right. Just
hypnotists. - Oh, okay. - key issue is, somebody can really assess
problem make sure not, talking someone reducing chest
pain, rather getting coronary artery problem- - 'Cause real
issue there. - could, right. - hypnosis might adjust wouldn't deal
deeper underlying issue. - right. hand. typically use
people, often see twice periodically, not every week.
certainly not every day, pain problem hypnosis helpful pain.
so, is, identifying hypnotizable are. give standard

stop smoking. elements take 15 minutes elements just
take one two minutes people can refresh reinforce. - Two minute hypnosis,
[indistinct] one minute. - Yes. - Yeah. - one two, one two minutes
now, finding two thirds people find even just one minute
refresher, helps feel better. reporting, feel better. So, nice thing is,
know right away, whether likely help not. found, done
studies, looking hypnosis pain relief acute medical procedures.
randomized trial published Lancet, three conditions, people getting

tell right away, whether likely help them, working clinician now using
app ways helping learn use skill. So, nice thing will
know quickly, whether likely help not. is, can learn
yourself. - great will, again, there'll link Reveri caption,

think that, mentioned, medications approaches dealing

00:56:53 Eliminating Obsessive Thoughts, Superstitions

- Great, thanks clarification. hopefully, time both, get asked lot
obsessive thoughts intrusive thoughts. also get asked lot OCD.
evidence hypnosis self-hypnosis can used for, dealing obsessive
thoughts? - Sometimes, obsessional people, just turn not
hypnotizable for, yeah, not random. tend controlling
thought, busy evaluating rather experiencing, so- - know people
like that. [David laughing] sounds like adaptive mindset lot professions. -
right. - get trained that, - Yeah. - school, obsess
exam, obsess the, - Yeah. - social interactions. mean, part
becoming functional human being. yet, can take us different- -
sometimes overdo it. mean, tell one example extreme situations, that,
know, judging, evaluating, not letting experience, including
emotionally. know somebody, listens tapes airplanes go down. So,
get black box listen it. said me, know- -
profession recreational- - No, profession. - Okay. -
did. 'Cause trying accident prevention handle things.
said worry people panicking, right? guys know
got 30 seconds 45 seconds just going
checklist. said, don't panic enough. taught do.
reason, good reason it. sometimes overdo it. painful
listen 'cause know going happen. So, kind balance
hit. sometimes get emotional absorbed not
enough sort see possibilities. can problem.
hand, sometimes rigid controlled don't let emotions guide
need protect protect others. So, say


general people OCD are, less hypnotizable side spectrum,
less likely allow engage any, typical example checking
OCD example, don't remember, whether locked door turned off
gas oven keep going back keep checking. So,
evaluative component brain, kind overrides experiential one sometimes
people can get benefit, not group select
likely respond self hypnotic approaches. - superstitions similar? -
Superstitions, think more, people hypnotizable, keep
getting caught things like superstitions there, imagination supplants
reality. seen lot happening recently. think there,
possible helped learning sort see put context, see
different point view. - developed pretty vicious superstition,
college hard break, actually. always feel, talk clinicians,
reveal certain things pathology. - Please do. - so- - get
bill later. - Thank you, yes, part reason arranged this. [David laughing] No,
just kidding. yeah, did. habit knocking wood things noticed
started to, sneak knocking wood every 'cause didn't want
people think often. started realize that, becoming
little bit reflex. saw incredible video Bence Olveczky's lab
Harvard. studies motor patterns. rats press different
sequences levers turn dials order get pellet food. that,
start introduce behaviors nothing actual lever
pressing, like start scratching hind quarters things like that. hat,
heads, excuse me, don't wear hats flipping ears. just like
pitcher throwing baseball. this, - Oh, yeah. - start incorporate
motor behaviors unrelated outcome, mind somehow starts think
necessary outcome. incorporate it. So, decided
break simply forcing not week. - Mm-hm. just
seemed like ridiculous, - [Both] thing do. Yeah, well- - Knock wood. - call
response prevention works. is, set new context
brain, get outcome want, devoid extraneous behavior. - Yeah,
knew nuts, right. knew illogical. - Right.

01:01:50 ‘Hypnotizability’, Spiegel Eye-roll Test



- somehow things take meaning. - [David] Right. - So, talked about,
utility hypnosis stress reduction, phobias, pain, possibly, don't know for,
things like ADHD OCD, just will depend hypnotizability. - Right. - talked
beautiful study the, metastatic breast cancer outcome patients.
Hypnotizability clearly key variable. - Yes. - please tell us,
hypnotizability is, evaluated Spiegel Eye-Roll Test is? - Okay,
sure. So, hypnotizability just capacity hypnotic experiences.
test called hypnotic conduction profile. give highly structured hypnotic
experience. old tradition clinical hypnosis was, try bunch
different things, talking, walking upstairs downstairs images time
say breathing subject that. change
clinician, less can make variation outcome. take
long time, know, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. just view kind complex,
not effective way assessing person's hypnotic capacity. know
peak period hypnotizability human life, latency years childhood. So,
every eight year old trance time. call 'em dinner, don't
hear ya, thing. childhood wonderful
experience. Work play thing. try make little
adults, think terrible mistake. Everything fun them. enjoy learning,
enjoy everything. - age this- - like 6 10, 6 11.
playful, enjoy everything. Everything sort game fun try
make miserable them, got it. when, Piaget called,
adult cognitive framework, learn abstract concepts, learn even one
bottle looks bigger other, can equal volume. so, imposing
logic, growing DLPFC point imposing cognitive structure
experience. people start lose hypnotic ability. time
early 20s, hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed. study done
Stanford, Ernest Hillard, Phil Zimbardo this, looking at, tracked
students psych one, hypnotizability measured retested
blindly 25 years later. test, retest correlation was, want guess
was? - guessing it's, don't know, 0.6 something. - Yeah, close. 0.7, IQ
0.6, 25 year interval. - Wow. - So, stable IQ 25
year interval. So, point, are. factors


lead that? Well, means that, third adults just
not hypnotizable. Two thirds are, 15% extremely hypnotizable can
measure give number 0 10. useful.
patients it, say, look, sorry, not hypnotizable going
something else. Medication, systematic desensitization, mindfulness, things
hypnotizable, just go it. don't lot explaining. People
low moderate hypnotizable, like explanations doing,
can still get benefits. So, helps guide nature treatment
people. Now, eye roll is, father used use eye fixation induction, used
say, look ceiling now close eyes looking up. very,
yes, very- - Yeah [indistinct] [laughs]. - noticed two patients back
back. one woman seen work with, hysterical seizures.
just suddenly start shaking. And- - Real epileptic seizures? - No, pseudo
epileptic seizures. - see, hysteria. - Hysteria, although people both,
the, people, real epilepsy becomes framework gets elaborated on,
stressed, seizures. just pseudo epilepsy, no EEG
abnormalities. really something watch. husband move
work bench near door, started seizure, run home
try help it. bad. noticed
did, looked up, one seizure events, see
sclera, don't see Iris anymore. start seize. great thing
her. taught seizures. Everybody else telling stop.
made one. hypnotized her, [indistinct] go back last time
one sure enough, start shake. gradually make smaller
smaller. So, learning control, access, like
PTSD, confront, don't avoid it, don't suppress it. confront figure
deal it. next patient rigid obsessional businessman
wanted stop controlling [chuckles], reminded me,
New Yorker cartoon driver, comes yield sign yells, "Never!"
always [indistinct]. - sounds right, New Yorker. - Yeah, New
Yorker. so, guy, tried look up, couldn't keep eyes
closed them. so, father started testing people. seemed
rough correlation capacity keep eyes up, closed
measured hypnotizability. - people listening [stutters], watching


video. So, Spiegel Eye-Roll Test, involves looking ceiling. So, tilting
head back, tilting chin back looking ceiling now. also
directing eyes upward eyes open. eye roll test involves
then, closing eyelids eyes open. - open. - whether not,
eyes roll back said it, see sclera, white part. - see sclera,
white part. - means you're, hypnotizable moderately hypnotizable. -
Right. - Whereas eyes move see iris, colored part eye
eyes close, less hypnotizable. - Right. - can look online there, just
put Spiegel Eye-Roll Test find it. also going actual
example hypnosis video later. - Right. So, asking brain something
difficult, keep eyes closing eyelids. contradictory signals
third, fourth sixth cranial nerve nuclei control eye movement. - said
third- - Fourth six, - Yup. - cranial nerve nuclei. suspending one
activity, asking another eye movements lot levels

close eyes sleep, rapid eye movement dream.
drugs, affect level consciousness, can affect eyes eye movements,
either dilation contraction pupils, depending whether stimulant
opioid. - Stimulants, make pupils big. - Big, right? - Yeah. Like cocaine,
amphetamine. - Right, exactly. - Things sort. - opioids, get constricted
pupils. - parents looking kids coming door late night,
looking substance abuse. - right. - Yeah. - So, something
eyes lot level consciousness. mean, obviously, close
eyes go sleep, rapid eye movement dreaming.
So, not surprising. old Zen practice called, looking third eye.
think part reason happens is, looking inside like
third eye two forehead. think
visual creatures, pretty pathetic physical point view. Many animals
can outrun us, outs smell us eagles read newsprint hundred yards
can't. So, major defensive sensory input vision. animals,
predator animals eyes front head, good,
detailed vision prey. Whereas prey animals like deer, eyes side
head. So, don't see things well, much bigger range potential
see threat. mainly use, fact, interesting, social


anthropologists say, gather do, coastlines edge

attack one side big vision might threaten you.
tend attracted kinds physical situations, so- - Yeah, love vistas. -
love vistas, right. - Vistas calming. take us panoramic

makes sense. - Sure. - But, signs locations built around, people's
tendency animals tendencies. - Oh, really [indistinct]? - aggregate there. Yeah,
interesting book history national parks says, didn't
give research study support it, no Google Maps, obviously. -
interesting. - Yeah, panorama visual boundaries really interesting. think,
eyes, know, two pieces central nervous system brain,
outside the- - Right. used say eyes outside skull neuro-
ophthalmologist wrote vehemently pointed outside

brain there. so, mentioned cranial nerves, three, four six.
isn't neuroanatomy course maybe go little deeper there. So, said
contradictory activity, looking controlled one set cranial nerves.
closing eyelids, controlled another cranial nerve. - No,
one. think six close eyes, activate, no, facial,
guess facial nerve. 7, yeah. - 7, yeah. - looking up, activating
muscles force eyes look up. closing eyelids normally relaxes
those, relaxes upper movement, eyes closed don't
need it. breaking usual customary pattern. - like rubbing the, -
Right. - hey, can't even it, see like the, - Right. [Andrew David laughing] -
exactly right. - Rubbing tummy patting head. bit

developed Spiegel Eye-Roll Test. - key issue this, normally
close eyes also, going sleep. not worried going
world anymore. Here, maintaining resting alertness. So, focusing
turning inward. unusual state. Normally close eyes periodically,
to, close eyes period time, normally go


sleep not worried detecting risk threat. So, interesting state
turning inward, basically, looking up, shutting eyes
allowing whatever happens outside happen focusing
going inward. So, think signal brain turn inward. - interesting.
meditation course, done eyes open almost always done
eyes closed. - Yes, right. - interesting. So, can quickly determine
whether not someone highly hypnotizable. - Right. - not hypnotizable.
said two thirds people can hypnotized. - Right. - Obviously third cannot.
within two thirds can, range, said 15% people fall
this, highly hypnotizable category. - Right, correct. - seem member
of. - Yeah. - And, repeated use self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis, increase
change hypnotizability, can access first place? - say
general, may increase little bit, not hell lot, not worth effort
increase hypnotizability point. worth trying deal problem,
dealing with. So, can get better using level have.
study done tried train people hypnotizable
obviously, there're subjective behavioral components test, can learn
little better them. found reanalyze data,
account three times final score, based initial hypnotizability
measurement, rather whether not trained better. So,
can improve little

01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)

not worth trouble. - Got it. Along lines eyes eye movements, lot
interest EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. -
Shapiro working, wasn't Stanford directly, local
Stanford. - Yeah. - think Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - thoughts
EMDR? useful, think less useful? things
EMDR combined make useful? listeners podcast
come to, think, come podcast range backgrounds interests. me,
makes sense EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given newer
data can suppress amygdala activity animals animal models
humans well. really hasn't explored much, neurally. heard things like,


coordinates two sides brain, it, just throwaway. don't think
evidence that, coordinating two sides brain better not
coordinating. wouldn't speaking right now two sides brain, well
correlated. - Yeah. - language lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - heard
mimics, rapid eye movements sleep, actually doesn't. So, - Right. -
heard people talk positive experiences EMDR.
thoughts EMDR? - Yeah, good comment one recent
podcasts. tell you, one way sort think bemused point view,
old, mentioned earlier, oldest sort idea hypnotic induction,
dangling watch, right? [indistinct] watch. And, fact, enough concern
automobiles invented, movement prevent
installing windshield wipers people afraid hypnotized,
watched windshield wipers go back forth car. Now, turns
fortunately that, tend not look windshield wipers. keep looking
windshield. so, windshield wipers today. movement is,
exactly used hypnotic induction. think lot hypnosis EMDR. - Ah. -
think, combination exposure based treatments, use
EMDR think it. tend not process experience much just
physical part it, personally think drawback. And, every study seen
dismantling study. no question people go EMDR, many
get better trauma related problems VA big program using
on. every program dismantled, going treatment
lateral eye movement, shown lateral eye movement, doesn't add
anything it. toward end career, Francine [indistinct]

things. So, tend think that, EMDR another form exposure based therapy
trauma, implied exception possible new data, certainly
doesn't with, rapid eye movement sleep. don't think moving eyes
issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put
weight this, going re-injure ankle example, simply mean
body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat
something coming opportunity something ameliorate situation. So,
not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding
happening. face also say, opportunity
something it. minute realistically enha- doesn't mean,
imagine away heart attack. means figure rehabilitate heart attack


broken leg something like way get much control

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body
floating, safe comfortable. Now, picture Mary sit feeling sadness
no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,
watch it, try [stutters]. work enjoying together shows
breathing patterns may increase sympathetic arousal may decrease. may
[indistinct] cyclic sighing seems to, actually, time spent exhaling

[stutters], enhance idea induction period relaxation, 'cause
think inducing perhaps perceiving well. So, no,
absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go
automatically can control it. so, kind way us demonstrate
ourselves, greater ways modulating internal state. So, can either it,
thinking it, way pain control hypnosis can

want see happen body. So, like right margin,
can enhance, me, like way augmenting hypnosis,
medication, think powerful way that. - Great, really excited see

directed mental focus, seem key elements hypnosis. missing


ingredients? - Yeah, think right. - It's- - Breathing, vision, - Breathing, vision,
change vision don't, know, typically physically relaxed

classical pianists say, not thinking, start thinking fingers
now, screw up. floating piano, thinking tone want
feel exuding instrument. hypnotic like state too. many athletes
peak performance, just flowing it. not thinking step step,
doing? best working
giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much
always you. can people learn about, can get
hypnotized? mentioned Reveri, put link it, R-E-V-E-R-I.com way
access that. - Reveri app app store, way. reveri.com
website, can get download Reveri app app
store. - Great. So, currently apple, hopefully soon, also Android,
meantime, people interested exploring clinical hypnosis, working
somebody similar? centralized resource people can go find, really
well-trained hypnotists? - two good professional organizations will help
that. One society clinical experimental hypnosis. think
sceh.us their- - Okay, look provide link. - American society
clinical hypnosis, provide referral services professionals. can look
up. just say general, look someone licensed trained
primary professional discipline, psychiatry, psychology, medicine, dentistry
training interest using hypnosis, way it. - Great one
question comment. question is, will psychiatrist? - [laughs]
honored. - tall task. might stubborn patient. - think hardest
work's already done, Andrew. - Thank you. - fine, now. - appreciate that.
[David laughing] Well, final thing comment. First all, thank much
today, sharing knowledge. - welcome. - hope can
again. - hope so. - love working laboratory you. -
Likewise [indistinct]. - speak, learn know others well. -
Thank you. - will put resources get also just want say, thank


work do. - Well, thank you. - incredible thing world
discovering much body works, mind still rather
mysterious people struggling lot things, also think people
really excited about, applying tools like hypnosis perform better, feel better mentally
physically. pointed us tremendous amount resources
tools work already demonstrated work. just, thank
you. know professional commitment life benefit. So, thank
so. - Well, thank you, real joy collaborating
using precision knowledge neuroanatomy, neurobiology
address problems often people disciplined primary
neurobiological end, aren't interested are. so, really pleasure
try bring together know different perspectives build
something neither us alone. so, real joy it. -

00:56:53 Eliminating Obsessive Thoughts, Superstitions

- Great, thanks clarification. hopefully, time both, get asked lot
obsessive thoughts intrusive thoughts. also get asked lot OCD.
evidence hypnosis self-hypnosis can used for, dealing obsessive
thoughts? - Sometimes, obsessional people, just turn not
hypnotizable for, yeah, not random. tend controlling
thought, busy evaluating rather experiencing, so- - know people
like that. [David laughing] sounds like adaptive mindset lot professions. -
right. - get trained that, - Yeah. - school, obsess
exam, obsess the, - Yeah. - social interactions. mean, part
becoming functional human being. yet, can take us different- -
sometimes overdo it. mean, tell one example extreme situations, that,
know, judging, evaluating, not letting experience, including
emotionally. know somebody, listens tapes airplanes go down. So,
get black box listen it. said me, know- -
profession recreational- - No, profession. - Okay. -
did. 'Cause trying accident prevention handle things.
said worry people panicking, right? guys know
got 30 seconds 45 seconds just going
checklist. said, don't panic enough. taught do.
reason, good reason it. sometimes overdo it. painful
listen 'cause know going happen. So, kind balance
hit. sometimes get emotional absorbed not
enough sort see possibilities. can problem.
hand, sometimes rigid controlled don't let emotions guide
need protect protect others. So, say


general people OCD are, less hypnotizable side spectrum,
less likely allow engage any, typical example checking
OCD example, don't remember, whether locked door turned off
gas oven keep going back keep checking. So,
evaluative component brain, kind overrides experiential one sometimes
people can get benefit, not group select

Superstitions, think more, people hypnotizable, keep
getting caught things like superstitions there, imagination supplants
reality. seen lot happening recently. think there,

01:01:50 ‘Hypnotizability’, Spiegel Eye-roll Test



- somehow things take meaning. - [David] Right. - So, talked about,
utility hypnosis stress reduction, phobias, pain, possibly, don't know for,
things like ADHD OCD, just will depend hypnotizability. - Right. - talked
beautiful study the, metastatic breast cancer outcome patients.
Hypnotizability clearly key variable. - Yes. - please tell us,
hypnotizability is, evaluated Spiegel Eye-Roll Test is? - Okay,
sure. So, hypnotizability just capacity hypnotic experiences.
test called hypnotic conduction profile. give highly structured hypnotic
experience. old tradition clinical hypnosis was, try bunch
different things, talking, walking upstairs downstairs images time
say breathing subject that. change
clinician, less can make variation outcome. take
long time, know, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. just view kind complex,
not effective way assessing person's hypnotic capacity. know
peak period hypnotizability human life, latency years childhood. So,
every eight year old trance time. call 'em dinner, don't
hear ya, thing. childhood wonderful

adults, think terrible mistake. Everything fun them. enjoy learning,
enjoy everything. - age this- - like 6 10, 6 11.
playful, enjoy everything. Everything sort game fun try
make miserable them, got it. when, Piaget called,
adult cognitive framework, learn abstract concepts, learn even one
bottle looks bigger other, can equal volume. so, imposing
logic, growing DLPFC point imposing cognitive structure
experience. people start lose hypnotic ability. time
early 20s, hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed. study done
Stanford, Ernest Hillard, Phil Zimbardo this, looking at, tracked
students psych one, hypnotizability measured retested
blindly 25 years later. test, retest correlation was, want guess
was? - guessing it's, don't know, 0.6 something. - Yeah, close. 0.7, IQ
0.6, 25 year interval. - Wow. - So, stable IQ 25
year interval. So, point, are. factors


lead that? Well, means that, third adults just
not hypnotizable. Two thirds are, 15% extremely hypnotizable can
measure give number 0 10. useful.
patients it, say, look, sorry, not hypnotizable going
something else. Medication, systematic desensitization, mindfulness, things
hypnotizable, just go it. don't lot explaining. People
low moderate hypnotizable, like explanations doing,
can still get benefits. So, helps guide nature treatment
people. Now, eye roll is, father used use eye fixation induction, used
say, look ceiling now close eyes looking up. very,
yes, very- - Yeah [indistinct] [laughs]. - noticed two patients back
back. one woman seen work with, hysterical seizures.
just suddenly start shaking. And- - Real epileptic seizures? - No, pseudo
epileptic seizures. - see, hysteria. - Hysteria, although people both,
the, people, real epilepsy becomes framework gets elaborated on,
stressed, seizures. just pseudo epilepsy, no EEG
abnormalities. really something watch. husband move
work bench near door, started seizure, run home
try help it. bad. noticed
did, looked up, one seizure events, see
sclera, don't see Iris anymore. start seize. great thing
her. taught seizures. Everybody else telling stop.
made one. hypnotized her, [indistinct] go back last time
one sure enough, start shake. gradually make smaller

PTSD, confront, don't avoid it, don't suppress it. confront figure
deal it. next patient rigid obsessional businessman
wanted stop controlling [chuckles], reminded me,
New Yorker cartoon driver, comes yield sign yells, "Never!"
always [indistinct]. - sounds right, New Yorker. - Yeah, New
Yorker. so, guy, tried look up, couldn't keep eyes
closed them. so, father started testing people. seemed
rough correlation capacity keep eyes up, closed
measured hypnotizability. - people listening [stutters], watching


video. So, Spiegel Eye-Roll Test, involves looking ceiling. So, tilting
head back, tilting chin back looking ceiling now. also
directing eyes upward eyes open. eye roll test involves
then, closing eyelids eyes open. - open. - whether not,
eyes roll back said it, see sclera, white part. - see sclera,
white part. - means you're, hypnotizable moderately hypnotizable. -
Right. - Whereas eyes move see iris, colored part eye
eyes close, less hypnotizable. - Right. - can look online there, just
put Spiegel Eye-Roll Test find it. also going actual
example hypnosis video later. - Right. So, asking brain something
difficult, keep eyes closing eyelids. contradictory signals
third, fourth sixth cranial nerve nuclei control eye movement. - said
third- - Fourth six, - Yup. - cranial nerve nuclei. suspending one
activity, asking another eye movements lot levels
consciousness. periaqueductal gray, surrounds cranial nerve nuclei.
close eyes sleep, rapid eye movement dream.
drugs, affect level consciousness, can affect eyes eye movements,
either dilation contraction pupils, depending whether stimulant
opioid. - Stimulants, make pupils big. - Big, right? - Yeah. Like cocaine,
amphetamine. - Right, exactly. - Things sort. - opioids, get constricted
pupils. - parents looking kids coming door late night,
looking substance abuse. - right. - Yeah. - So, something
eyes lot level consciousness. mean, obviously, close
eyes go sleep, rapid eye movement dreaming.
So, not surprising. old Zen practice called, looking third eye.
think part reason happens is, looking inside like
third eye two forehead. think
visual creatures, pretty pathetic physical point view. Many animals
can outrun us, outs smell us eagles read newsprint hundred yards
can't. So, major defensive sensory input vision. animals,
predator animals eyes front head, good,
detailed vision prey. Whereas prey animals like deer, eyes side
head. So, don't see things well, much bigger range potential
see threat. mainly use, fact, interesting, social


anthropologists say, gather do, coastlines edge

attack one side big vision might threaten you.
tend attracted kinds physical situations, so- - Yeah, love vistas. -
love vistas, right. - Vistas calming. take us panoramic

location national parks people naturally aggregated was-
makes sense. - Sure. - But, signs locations built around, people's
tendency animals tendencies. - Oh, really [indistinct]? - aggregate there. Yeah,
interesting book history national parks says, didn't
give research study support it, no Google Maps, obviously. -
interesting. - Yeah, panorama visual boundaries really interesting. think,
eyes, know, two pieces central nervous system brain,

contradictory activity, looking controlled one set cranial nerves.
closing eyelids, controlled another cranial nerve. - No,
one. think six close eyes, activate, no, facial,

Right. - hey, can't even it, see like the, - Right. [Andrew David laughing] -
exactly right. - Rubbing tummy patting head. bit

father. So, Spiegel senior Spiegel junior? - Spiegel senior. -
developed Spiegel Eye-Roll Test. - key issue this, normally
close eyes also, going sleep. not worried going
world anymore. Here, maintaining resting alertness. So, focusing
turning inward. unusual state. Normally close eyes periodically,
to, close eyes period time, normally go


sleep not worried detecting risk threat. So, interesting state
turning inward, basically, looking up, shutting eyes
allowing whatever happens outside happen focusing
going inward. So, think signal brain turn inward. - interesting.
meditation course, done eyes open almost always done
eyes closed. - Yes, right. - interesting. So, can quickly determine
whether not someone highly hypnotizable. - Right. - not hypnotizable.
said two thirds people can hypnotized. - Right. - Obviously third cannot.
within two thirds can, range, said 15% people fall
this, highly hypnotizable category. - Right, correct. - seem member
of. - Yeah. - And, repeated use self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis, increase
change hypnotizability, can access first place? - say
general, may increase little bit, not hell lot, not worth effort
increase hypnotizability point. worth trying deal problem,
dealing with. So, can get better using level have.
study done tried train people hypnotizable
obviously, there're subjective behavioral components test, can learn
little better them. found reanalyze data,
account three times final score, based initial hypnotizability
measurement, rather whether not trained better. So,
can improve little

01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)

not worth trouble. - Got it. Along lines eyes eye movements, lot
interest EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. -
Shapiro working, wasn't Stanford directly, local
Stanford. - Yeah. - think Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - thoughts
EMDR? useful, think less useful? things
EMDR combined make useful? listeners podcast
come to, think, come podcast range backgrounds interests. me,
makes sense EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given newer
data can suppress amygdala activity animals animal models
humans well. really hasn't explored much, neurally. heard things like,


coordinates two sides brain, it, just throwaway. don't think
evidence that, coordinating two sides brain better not
coordinating. wouldn't speaking right now two sides brain, well
correlated. - Yeah. - language lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - heard
mimics, rapid eye movements sleep, actually doesn't. So, - Right. -
heard people talk positive experiences EMDR.
thoughts EMDR? - Yeah, good comment one recent
podcasts. tell you, one way sort think bemused point view,
old, mentioned earlier, oldest sort idea hypnotic induction,
dangling watch, right? [indistinct] watch. And, fact, enough concern
automobiles invented, movement prevent

watched windshield wipers go back forth car. Now, turns
fortunately that, tend not look windshield wipers. keep looking

exactly used hypnotic induction. think lot hypnosis EMDR. - Ah. -
think, combination exposure based treatments, use
EMDR think it. tend not process experience much just
physical part it, personally think drawback. And, every study seen
dismantling study. no question people go EMDR, many

things. So, tend think that, EMDR another form exposure based therapy
trauma, implied exception possible new data, certainly
doesn't with, rapid eye movement sleep. don't think moving eyes
issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put
weight this, going re-injure ankle example, simply mean
body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat
something coming opportunity something ameliorate situation. So,
not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding
happening. face also say, opportunity
something it. minute realistically enha- doesn't mean,
imagine away heart attack. means figure rehabilitate heart attack


broken leg something like way get much control

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body
floating, safe comfortable. Now, picture Mary sit feeling sadness
no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,
watch it, try [stutters]. work enjoying together shows
breathing patterns may increase sympathetic arousal may decrease. may
[indistinct] cyclic sighing seems to, actually, time spent exhaling

absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go
automatically can control it. so, kind way us demonstrate
ourselves, greater ways modulating internal state. So, can either it,
thinking it, way pain control hypnosis can

want see happen body. So, like right margin,
can enhance, me, like way augmenting hypnosis,
medication, think powerful way that. - Great, really excited see

directed mental focus, seem key elements hypnosis. missing


ingredients? - Yeah, think right. - It's- - Breathing, vision, - Breathing, vision,
change vision don't, know, typically physically relaxed
state, frankly people peak performance, including physical athletic
performance musical performance hypnotic states too. talked
classical pianists say, not thinking, start thinking fingers
now, screw up. floating piano, thinking tone want
feel exuding instrument. hypnotic like state too. many athletes
peak performance, just flowing it. not thinking step step,
doing? best working
giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much
always you. can people learn about, can get
hypnotized? mentioned Reveri, put link it, R-E-V-E-R-I.com way
access that. - Reveri app app store, way. reveri.com
website, can get download Reveri app app
store. - Great. So, currently apple, hopefully soon, also Android,
meantime, people interested exploring clinical hypnosis, working
somebody similar? centralized resource people can go find, really
well-trained hypnotists? - two good professional organizations will help
that. One society clinical experimental hypnosis. think
sceh.us their- - Okay, look provide link. - American society
clinical hypnosis, provide referral services professionals. can look
up. just say general, look someone licensed trained
primary professional discipline, psychiatry, psychology, medicine, dentistry
training interest using hypnosis, way it. - Great one
question comment. question is, will psychiatrist? - [laughs]
honored. - tall task. might stubborn patient. - think hardest
work's already done, Andrew. - Thank you. - fine, now. - appreciate that.
[David laughing] Well, final thing comment. First all, thank much
today, sharing knowledge. - welcome. - hope can
again. - hope so. - love working laboratory you. -
Likewise [indistinct]. - speak, learn know others well. -
Thank you. - will put resources get also just want say, thank


work do. - Well, thank you. - incredible thing world
discovering much body works, mind still rather
mysterious people struggling lot things, also think people
really excited about, applying tools like hypnosis perform better, feel better mentally
physically. pointed us tremendous amount resources
tools work already demonstrated work. just, thank
you. know professional commitment life benefit. So, thank
so. - Well, thank you, real joy collaborating
using precision knowledge neuroanatomy, neurobiology
address problems often people disciplined primary
neurobiological end, aren't interested are. so, really pleasure
try bring together know different perspectives build
something neither us alone. so, real joy it. -

00:56:53 Eliminating Obsessive Thoughts, Superstitions

- Great, thanks clarification. hopefully, time both, get asked lot
obsessive thoughts intrusive thoughts. also get asked lot OCD.
evidence hypnosis self-hypnosis can used for, dealing obsessive
thoughts? - Sometimes, obsessional people, just turn not
hypnotizable for, yeah, not random. tend controlling
thought, busy evaluating rather experiencing, so- - know people
like that. [David laughing] sounds like adaptive mindset lot professions. -
right. - get trained that, - Yeah. - school, obsess
exam, obsess the, - Yeah. - social interactions. mean, part
becoming functional human being. yet, can take us different- -
sometimes overdo it. mean, tell one example extreme situations, that,
know, judging, evaluating, not letting experience, including
emotionally. know somebody, listens tapes airplanes go down. So,
get black box listen it. said me, know- -
profession recreational- - No, profession. - Okay. -
did. 'Cause trying accident prevention handle things.
said worry people panicking, right? guys know
got 30 seconds 45 seconds just going
checklist. said, don't panic enough. taught do.
reason, good reason it. sometimes overdo it. painful
listen 'cause know going happen. So, kind balance
hit. sometimes get emotional absorbed not
enough sort see possibilities. can problem.
hand, sometimes rigid controlled don't let emotions guide
need protect protect others. So, say


general people OCD are, less hypnotizable side spectrum,
less likely allow engage any, typical example checking
OCD example, don't remember, whether locked door turned off
gas oven keep going back keep checking. So,
evaluative component brain, kind overrides experiential one sometimes
people can get benefit, not group select
likely respond self hypnotic approaches. - superstitions similar? -
Superstitions, think more, people hypnotizable, keep
getting caught things like superstitions there, imagination supplants
reality. seen lot happening recently. think there,
possible helped learning sort see put context, see
different point view. - developed pretty vicious superstition,
college hard break, actually. always feel, talk clinicians,
reveal certain things pathology. - Please do. - so- - get
bill later. - Thank you, yes, part reason arranged this. [David laughing] No,
just kidding. yeah, did. habit knocking wood things noticed
started to, sneak knocking wood every 'cause didn't want
people think often. started realize that, becoming
little bit reflex. saw incredible video Bence Olveczky's lab
Harvard. studies motor patterns. rats press different
sequences levers turn dials order get pellet food. that,
start introduce behaviors nothing actual lever
pressing, like start scratching hind quarters things like that. hat,
heads, excuse me, don't wear hats flipping ears. just like
pitcher throwing baseball. this, - Oh, yeah. - start incorporate
motor behaviors unrelated outcome, mind somehow starts think
necessary outcome. incorporate it. So, decided
break simply forcing not week. - Mm-hm. just
seemed like ridiculous, - [Both] thing do. Yeah, well- - Knock wood. - call
response prevention works. is, set new context
brain, get outcome want, devoid extraneous behavior. - Yeah,
knew nuts, right. knew illogical. - Right.

01:01:50 ‘Hypnotizability’, Spiegel Eye-roll Test



- somehow things take meaning. - [David] Right. - So, talked about,
utility hypnosis stress reduction, phobias, pain, possibly, don't know for,
things like ADHD OCD, just will depend hypnotizability. - Right. - talked
beautiful study the, metastatic breast cancer outcome patients.
Hypnotizability clearly key variable. - Yes. - please tell us,
hypnotizability is, evaluated Spiegel Eye-Roll Test is? - Okay,
sure. So, hypnotizability just capacity hypnotic experiences.
test called hypnotic conduction profile. give highly structured hypnotic
experience. old tradition clinical hypnosis was, try bunch
different things, talking, walking upstairs downstairs images time
say breathing subject that. change
clinician, less can make variation outcome. take
long time, know, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. just view kind complex,
not effective way assessing person's hypnotic capacity. know
peak period hypnotizability human life, latency years childhood. So,
every eight year old trance time. call 'em dinner, don't
hear ya, thing. childhood wonderful
experience. Work play thing. try make little
adults, think terrible mistake. Everything fun them. enjoy learning,
enjoy everything. - age this- - like 6 10, 6 11.
playful, enjoy everything. Everything sort game fun try
make miserable them, got it. when, Piaget called,
adult cognitive framework, learn abstract concepts, learn even one
bottle looks bigger other, can equal volume. so, imposing
logic, growing DLPFC point imposing cognitive structure
experience. people start lose hypnotic ability. time
early 20s, hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed. study done
Stanford, Ernest Hillard, Phil Zimbardo this, looking at, tracked
students psych one, hypnotizability measured retested
blindly 25 years later. test, retest correlation was, want guess
was? - guessing it's, don't know, 0.6 something. - Yeah, close. 0.7, IQ
0.6, 25 year interval. - Wow. - So, stable IQ 25
year interval. So, point, are. factors


lead that? Well, means that, third adults just
not hypnotizable. Two thirds are, 15% extremely hypnotizable can
measure give number 0 10. useful.
patients it, say, look, sorry, not hypnotizable going
something else. Medication, systematic desensitization, mindfulness, things
hypnotizable, just go it. don't lot explaining. People
low moderate hypnotizable, like explanations doing,
can still get benefits. So, helps guide nature treatment
people. Now, eye roll is, father used use eye fixation induction, used
say, look ceiling now close eyes looking up. very,
yes, very- - Yeah [indistinct] [laughs]. - noticed two patients back
back. one woman seen work with, hysterical seizures.
just suddenly start shaking. And- - Real epileptic seizures? - No, pseudo
epileptic seizures. - see, hysteria. - Hysteria, although people both,
the, people, real epilepsy becomes framework gets elaborated on,
stressed, seizures. just pseudo epilepsy, no EEG
abnormalities. really something watch. husband move
work bench near door, started seizure, run home
try help it. bad. noticed
did, looked up, one seizure events, see
sclera, don't see Iris anymore. start seize. great thing
her. taught seizures. Everybody else telling stop.
made one. hypnotized her, [indistinct] go back last time
one sure enough, start shake. gradually make smaller
smaller. So, learning control, access, like
PTSD, confront, don't avoid it, don't suppress it. confront figure
deal it. next patient rigid obsessional businessman
wanted stop controlling [chuckles], reminded me,
New Yorker cartoon driver, comes yield sign yells, "Never!"
always [indistinct]. - sounds right, New Yorker. - Yeah, New
Yorker. so, guy, tried look up, couldn't keep eyes
closed them. so, father started testing people. seemed
rough correlation capacity keep eyes up, closed
measured hypnotizability. - people listening [stutters], watching


video. So, Spiegel Eye-Roll Test, involves looking ceiling. So, tilting
head back, tilting chin back looking ceiling now. also
directing eyes upward eyes open. eye roll test involves
then, closing eyelids eyes open. - open. - whether not,
eyes roll back said it, see sclera, white part. - see sclera,
white part. - means you're, hypnotizable moderately hypnotizable. -
Right. - Whereas eyes move see iris, colored part eye
eyes close, less hypnotizable. - Right. - can look online there, just
put Spiegel Eye-Roll Test find it. also going actual
example hypnosis video later. - Right. So, asking brain something
difficult, keep eyes closing eyelids. contradictory signals
third, fourth sixth cranial nerve nuclei control eye movement. - said
third- - Fourth six, - Yup. - cranial nerve nuclei. suspending one
activity, asking another eye movements lot levels
consciousness. periaqueductal gray, surrounds cranial nerve nuclei.
close eyes sleep, rapid eye movement dream.
drugs, affect level consciousness, can affect eyes eye movements,
either dilation contraction pupils, depending whether stimulant
opioid. - Stimulants, make pupils big. - Big, right? - Yeah. Like cocaine,
amphetamine. - Right, exactly. - Things sort. - opioids, get constricted
pupils. - parents looking kids coming door late night,
looking substance abuse. - right. - Yeah. - So, something
eyes lot level consciousness. mean, obviously, close
eyes go sleep, rapid eye movement dreaming.
So, not surprising. old Zen practice called, looking third eye.
think part reason happens is, looking inside like
third eye two forehead. think
visual creatures, pretty pathetic physical point view. Many animals
can outrun us, outs smell us eagles read newsprint hundred yards
can't. So, major defensive sensory input vision. animals,
predator animals eyes front head, good,
detailed vision prey. Whereas prey animals like deer, eyes side
head. So, don't see things well, much bigger range potential
see threat. mainly use, fact, interesting, social


anthropologists say, gather do, coastlines edge
forest something, got protection back. Something can
attack one side big vision might threaten you.
tend attracted kinds physical situations, so- - Yeah, love vistas. -
love vistas, right. - Vistas calming. take us panoramic
vision. - right. - didn't know this, turns scenic spots
location national parks people naturally aggregated was-
makes sense. - Sure. - But, signs locations built around, people's
tendency animals tendencies. - Oh, really [indistinct]? - aggregate there. Yeah,
interesting book history national parks says, didn't
give research study support it, no Google Maps, obviously. -
interesting. - Yeah, panorama visual boundaries really interesting. think,
eyes, know, two pieces central nervous system brain,
outside the- - Right. used say eyes outside skull neuro-
ophthalmologist wrote vehemently pointed outside
cranial vault, so, know. outside cranial vault two pieces
brain there. so, mentioned cranial nerves, three, four six.
isn't neuroanatomy course maybe go little deeper there. So, said
contradictory activity, looking controlled one set cranial nerves.
closing eyelids, controlled another cranial nerve. - No,
one. think six close eyes, activate, no, facial,
guess facial nerve. 7, yeah. - 7, yeah. - looking up, activating
muscles force eyes look up. closing eyelids normally relaxes
those, relaxes upper movement, eyes closed don't
need it. breaking usual customary pattern. - like rubbing the, -
Right. - hey, can't even it, see like the, - Right. [Andrew David laughing] -
exactly right. - Rubbing tummy patting head. bit
conflict there, - Right. - clinically, good probe you, - has. -
father. So, Spiegel senior Spiegel junior? - Spiegel senior. -
developed Spiegel Eye-Roll Test. - key issue this, normally
close eyes also, going sleep. not worried going
world anymore. Here, maintaining resting alertness. So, focusing
turning inward. unusual state. Normally close eyes periodically,
to, close eyes period time, normally go


sleep not worried detecting risk threat. So, interesting state
turning inward, basically, looking up, shutting eyes
allowing whatever happens outside happen focusing
going inward. So, think signal brain turn inward. - interesting.
meditation course, done eyes open almost always done
eyes closed. - Yes, right. - interesting. So, can quickly determine
whether not someone highly hypnotizable. - Right. - not hypnotizable.
said two thirds people can hypnotized. - Right. - Obviously third cannot.
within two thirds can, range, said 15% people fall
this, highly hypnotizable category. - Right, correct. - seem member
of. - Yeah. - And, repeated use self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis, increase
change hypnotizability, can access first place? - say
general, may increase little bit, not hell lot, not worth effort
increase hypnotizability point. worth trying deal problem,
dealing with. So, can get better using level have.
study done tried train people hypnotizable
obviously, there're subjective behavioral components test, can learn
little better them. found reanalyze data,
account three times final score, based initial hypnotizability
measurement, rather whether not trained better. So,
can improve little

01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)

not worth trouble. - Got it. Along lines eyes eye movements, lot
interest EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. -
Shapiro working, wasn't Stanford directly, local
Stanford. - Yeah. - think Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - thoughts
EMDR? useful, think less useful? things
EMDR combined make useful? listeners podcast
come to, think, come podcast range backgrounds interests. me,
makes sense EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given newer
data can suppress amygdala activity animals animal models
humans well. really hasn't explored much, neurally. heard things like,


coordinates two sides brain, it, just throwaway. don't think
evidence that, coordinating two sides brain better not
coordinating. wouldn't speaking right now two sides brain, well
correlated. - Yeah. - language lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - heard
mimics, rapid eye movements sleep, actually doesn't. So, - Right. -
heard people talk positive experiences EMDR.
thoughts EMDR? - Yeah, good comment one recent
podcasts. tell you, one way sort think bemused point view,
old, mentioned earlier, oldest sort idea hypnotic induction,
dangling watch, right? [indistinct] watch. And, fact, enough concern
automobiles invented, movement prevent
installing windshield wipers people afraid hypnotized,
watched windshield wipers go back forth car. Now, turns
fortunately that, tend not look windshield wipers. keep looking
windshield. so, windshield wipers today. movement is,
exactly used hypnotic induction. think lot hypnosis EMDR. - Ah. -
think, combination exposure based treatments, use
EMDR think it. tend not process experience much just
physical part it, personally think drawback. And, every study seen
dismantling study. no question people go EMDR, many
get better trauma related problems VA big program using
on. every program dismantled, going treatment
lateral eye movement, shown lateral eye movement, doesn't add
anything it. toward end career, Francine [indistinct]
contralateral touching something, wasn't eye movements anymore.
things. So, tend think that, EMDR another form exposure based therapy
trauma, implied exception possible new data, certainly
doesn't with, rapid eye movement sleep. don't think moving eyes
issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put
weight this, going re-injure ankle example, simply mean
body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat
something coming opportunity something ameliorate situation. So,
not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding
happening. face also say, opportunity
something it. minute realistically enha- doesn't mean,
imagine away heart attack. means figure rehabilitate heart attack


broken leg something like way get much control

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body
floating, safe comfortable. Now, picture Mary sit feeling sadness
no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much
always you. can people learn about, can get
hypnotized? mentioned Reveri, put link it, R-E-V-E-R-I.com way
access that. - Reveri app app store, way. reveri.com
website, can get download Reveri app app
store. - Great. So, currently apple, hopefully soon, also Android,
meantime, people interested exploring clinical hypnosis, working
somebody similar? centralized resource people can go find, really
well-trained hypnotists? - two good professional organizations will help
that. One society clinical experimental hypnosis. think
sceh.us their- - Okay, look provide link. - American society
clinical hypnosis, provide referral services professionals. can look
up. just say general, look someone licensed trained
primary professional discipline, psychiatry, psychology, medicine, dentistry
training interest using hypnosis, way it. - Great one
question comment. question is, will psychiatrist? - [laughs]
honored. - tall task. might stubborn patient. - think hardest
work's already done, Andrew. - Thank you. - fine, now. - appreciate that.
[David laughing] Well, final thing comment. First all, thank much
today, sharing knowledge. - welcome. - hope can
again. - hope so. - love working laboratory you. -
Likewise [indistinct]. - speak, learn know others well. -
Thank you. - will put resources get also just want say, thank


work do. - Well, thank you. - incredible thing world

mysterious people struggling lot things, also think people
really excited about, applying tools like hypnosis perform better, feel better mentally
physically. pointed us tremendous amount resources

you. know professional commitment life benefit. So, thank
so. - Well, thank you, real joy collaborating

00:56:53 Eliminating Obsessive Thoughts, Superstitions

- Great, thanks clarification. hopefully, time both, get asked lot
obsessive thoughts intrusive thoughts. also get asked lot OCD.
evidence hypnosis self-hypnosis can used for, dealing obsessive
thoughts? - Sometimes, obsessional people, just turn not
hypnotizable for, yeah, not random. tend controlling
thought, busy evaluating rather experiencing, so- - know people
like that. [David laughing] sounds like adaptive mindset lot professions. -
right. - get trained that, - Yeah. - school, obsess
exam, obsess the, - Yeah. - social interactions. mean, part
becoming functional human being. yet, can take us different- -
sometimes overdo it. mean, tell one example extreme situations, that,
know, judging, evaluating, not letting experience, including
emotionally. know somebody, listens tapes airplanes go down. So,
get black box listen it. said me, know- -
profession recreational- - No, profession. - Okay. -
did. 'Cause trying accident prevention handle things.
said worry people panicking, right? guys know
got 30 seconds 45 seconds just going
checklist. said, don't panic enough. taught do.
reason, good reason it. sometimes overdo it. painful
listen 'cause know going happen. So, kind balance
hit. sometimes get emotional absorbed not
enough sort see possibilities. can problem.
hand, sometimes rigid controlled don't let emotions guide
need protect protect others. So, say


general people OCD are, less hypnotizable side spectrum,
less likely allow engage any, typical example checking
OCD example, don't remember, whether locked door turned off
gas oven keep going back keep checking. So,
evaluative component brain, kind overrides experiential one sometimes
people can get benefit, not group select
likely respond self hypnotic approaches. - superstitions similar? -
Superstitions, think more, people hypnotizable, keep
getting caught things like superstitions there, imagination supplants
reality. seen lot happening recently. think there,
possible helped learning sort see put context, see
different point view. - developed pretty vicious superstition,
college hard break, actually. always feel, talk clinicians,
reveal certain things pathology. - Please do. - so- - get
bill later. - Thank you, yes, part reason arranged this. [David laughing] No,
just kidding. yeah, did. habit knocking wood things noticed
started to, sneak knocking wood every 'cause didn't want
people think often. started realize that, becoming
little bit reflex. saw incredible video Bence Olveczky's lab
Harvard. studies motor patterns. rats press different
sequences levers turn dials order get pellet food. that,
start introduce behaviors nothing actual lever
pressing, like start scratching hind quarters things like that. hat,
heads, excuse me, don't wear hats flipping ears. just like
pitcher throwing baseball. this, - Oh, yeah. - start incorporate
motor behaviors unrelated outcome, mind somehow starts think
necessary outcome. incorporate it. So, decided
break simply forcing not week. - Mm-hm. just
seemed like ridiculous, - [Both] thing do. Yeah, well- - Knock wood. - call
response prevention works. is, set new context
brain, get outcome want, devoid extraneous behavior. - Yeah,
knew nuts, right. knew illogical. - Right.

01:01:50 ‘Hypnotizability’, Spiegel Eye-roll Test



- somehow things take meaning. - [David] Right. - So, talked about,
utility hypnosis stress reduction, phobias, pain, possibly, don't know for,
things like ADHD OCD, just will depend hypnotizability. - Right. - talked
beautiful study the, metastatic breast cancer outcome patients.
Hypnotizability clearly key variable. - Yes. - please tell us,
hypnotizability is, evaluated Spiegel Eye-Roll Test is? - Okay,
sure. So, hypnotizability just capacity hypnotic experiences.
test called hypnotic conduction profile. give highly structured hypnotic
experience. old tradition clinical hypnosis was, try bunch
different things, talking, walking upstairs downstairs images time
say breathing subject that. change
clinician, less can make variation outcome. take
long time, know, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. just view kind complex,
not effective way assessing person's hypnotic capacity. know
peak period hypnotizability human life, latency years childhood. So,
every eight year old trance time. call 'em dinner, don't
hear ya, thing. childhood wonderful
experience. Work play thing. try make little
adults, think terrible mistake. Everything fun them. enjoy learning,
enjoy everything. - age this- - like 6 10, 6 11.
playful, enjoy everything. Everything sort game fun try
make miserable them, got it. when, Piaget called,
adult cognitive framework, learn abstract concepts, learn even one
bottle looks bigger other, can equal volume. so, imposing
logic, growing DLPFC point imposing cognitive structure
experience. people start lose hypnotic ability. time
early 20s, hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed. study done
Stanford, Ernest Hillard, Phil Zimbardo this, looking at, tracked
students psych one, hypnotizability measured retested
blindly 25 years later. test, retest correlation was, want guess
was? - guessing it's, don't know, 0.6 something. - Yeah, close. 0.7, IQ
0.6, 25 year interval. - Wow. - So, stable IQ 25
year interval. So, point, are. factors


lead that? Well, means that, third adults just
not hypnotizable. Two thirds are, 15% extremely hypnotizable can
measure give number 0 10. useful.
patients it, say, look, sorry, not hypnotizable going
something else. Medication, systematic desensitization, mindfulness, things
hypnotizable, just go it. don't lot explaining. People
low moderate hypnotizable, like explanations doing,
can still get benefits. So, helps guide nature treatment
people. Now, eye roll is, father used use eye fixation induction, used
say, look ceiling now close eyes looking up. very,
yes, very- - Yeah [indistinct] [laughs]. - noticed two patients back
back. one woman seen work with, hysterical seizures.
just suddenly start shaking. And- - Real epileptic seizures? - No, pseudo
epileptic seizures. - see, hysteria. - Hysteria, although people both,
the, people, real epilepsy becomes framework gets elaborated on,
stressed, seizures. just pseudo epilepsy, no EEG
abnormalities. really something watch. husband move
work bench near door, started seizure, run home
try help it. bad. noticed
did, looked up, one seizure events, see
sclera, don't see Iris anymore. start seize. great thing
her. taught seizures. Everybody else telling stop.
made one. hypnotized her, [indistinct] go back last time
one sure enough, start shake. gradually make smaller
smaller. So, learning control, access, like
PTSD, confront, don't avoid it, don't suppress it. confront figure
deal it. next patient rigid obsessional businessman
wanted stop controlling [chuckles], reminded me,
New Yorker cartoon driver, comes yield sign yells, "Never!"
always [indistinct]. - sounds right, New Yorker. - Yeah, New
Yorker. so, guy, tried look up, couldn't keep eyes
closed them. so, father started testing people. seemed
rough correlation capacity keep eyes up, closed
measured hypnotizability. - people listening [stutters], watching


video. So, Spiegel Eye-Roll Test, involves looking ceiling. So, tilting
head back, tilting chin back looking ceiling now. also
directing eyes upward eyes open. eye roll test involves
then, closing eyelids eyes open. - open. - whether not,
eyes roll back said it, see sclera, white part. - see sclera,
white part. - means you're, hypnotizable moderately hypnotizable. -
Right. - Whereas eyes move see iris, colored part eye
eyes close, less hypnotizable. - Right. - can look online there, just
put Spiegel Eye-Roll Test find it. also going actual
example hypnosis video later. - Right. So, asking brain something
difficult, keep eyes closing eyelids. contradictory signals
third, fourth sixth cranial nerve nuclei control eye movement. - said
third- - Fourth six, - Yup. - cranial nerve nuclei. suspending one
activity, asking another eye movements lot levels
consciousness. periaqueductal gray, surrounds cranial nerve nuclei.
close eyes sleep, rapid eye movement dream.
drugs, affect level consciousness, can affect eyes eye movements,
either dilation contraction pupils, depending whether stimulant
opioid. - Stimulants, make pupils big. - Big, right? - Yeah. Like cocaine,
amphetamine. - Right, exactly. - Things sort. - opioids, get constricted
pupils. - parents looking kids coming door late night,
looking substance abuse. - right. - Yeah. - So, something
eyes lot level consciousness. mean, obviously, close
eyes go sleep, rapid eye movement dreaming.
So, not surprising. old Zen practice called, looking third eye.
think part reason happens is, looking inside like
third eye two forehead. think
visual creatures, pretty pathetic physical point view. Many animals
can outrun us, outs smell us eagles read newsprint hundred yards
can't. So, major defensive sensory input vision. animals,
predator animals eyes front head, good,
detailed vision prey. Whereas prey animals like deer, eyes side
head. So, don't see things well, much bigger range potential
see threat. mainly use, fact, interesting, social


anthropologists say, gather do, coastlines edge
forest something, got protection back. Something can
attack one side big vision might threaten you.
tend attracted kinds physical situations, so- - Yeah, love vistas. -
love vistas, right. - Vistas calming. take us panoramic
vision. - right. - didn't know this, turns scenic spots
location national parks people naturally aggregated was-
makes sense. - Sure. - But, signs locations built around, people's
tendency animals tendencies. - Oh, really [indistinct]? - aggregate there. Yeah,
interesting book history national parks says, didn't
give research study support it, no Google Maps, obviously. -
interesting. - Yeah, panorama visual boundaries really interesting. think,
eyes, know, two pieces central nervous system brain,
outside the- - Right. used say eyes outside skull neuro-
ophthalmologist wrote vehemently pointed outside
cranial vault, so, know. outside cranial vault two pieces
brain there. so, mentioned cranial nerves, three, four six.
isn't neuroanatomy course maybe go little deeper there. So, said
contradictory activity, looking controlled one set cranial nerves.
closing eyelids, controlled another cranial nerve. - No,
one. think six close eyes, activate, no, facial,
guess facial nerve. 7, yeah. - 7, yeah. - looking up, activating
muscles force eyes look up. closing eyelids normally relaxes
those, relaxes upper movement, eyes closed don't
need it. breaking usual customary pattern. - like rubbing the, -
Right. - hey, can't even it, see like the, - Right. [Andrew David laughing] -
exactly right. - Rubbing tummy patting head. bit
conflict there, - Right. - clinically, good probe you, - has. -
father. So, Spiegel senior Spiegel junior? - Spiegel senior. -
developed Spiegel Eye-Roll Test. - key issue this, normally
close eyes also, going sleep. not worried going
world anymore. Here, maintaining resting alertness. So, focusing
turning inward. unusual state. Normally close eyes periodically,
to, close eyes period time, normally go


sleep not worried detecting risk threat. So, interesting state
turning inward, basically, looking up, shutting eyes
allowing whatever happens outside happen focusing
going inward. So, think signal brain turn inward. - interesting.
meditation course, done eyes open almost always done
eyes closed. - Yes, right. - interesting. So, can quickly determine
whether not someone highly hypnotizable. - Right. - not hypnotizable.
said two thirds people can hypnotized. - Right. - Obviously third cannot.
within two thirds can, range, said 15% people fall
this, highly hypnotizable category. - Right, correct. - seem member
of. - Yeah. - And, repeated use self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis, increase
change hypnotizability, can access first place? - say
general, may increase little bit, not hell lot, not worth effort
increase hypnotizability point. worth trying deal problem,
dealing with. So, can get better using level have.
study done tried train people hypnotizable
obviously, there're subjective behavioral components test, can learn
little better them. found reanalyze data,
account three times final score, based initial hypnotizability
measurement, rather whether not trained better. So,
can improve little

01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)

not worth trouble. - Got it. Along lines eyes eye movements, lot
interest EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. -
Shapiro working, wasn't Stanford directly, local
Stanford. - Yeah. - think Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - thoughts
EMDR? useful, think less useful? things
EMDR combined make useful? listeners podcast
come to, think, come podcast range backgrounds interests. me,
makes sense EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given newer
data can suppress amygdala activity animals animal models
humans well. really hasn't explored much, neurally. heard things like,


coordinates two sides brain, it, just throwaway. don't think
evidence that, coordinating two sides brain better not
coordinating. wouldn't speaking right now two sides brain, well
correlated. - Yeah. - language lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - heard
mimics, rapid eye movements sleep, actually doesn't. So, - Right. -
heard people talk positive experiences EMDR.
thoughts EMDR? - Yeah, good comment one recent
podcasts. tell you, one way sort think bemused point view,
old, mentioned earlier, oldest sort idea hypnotic induction,
dangling watch, right? [indistinct] watch. And, fact, enough concern
automobiles invented, movement prevent
installing windshield wipers people afraid hypnotized,
watched windshield wipers go back forth car. Now, turns
fortunately that, tend not look windshield wipers. keep looking
windshield. so, windshield wipers today. movement is,
exactly used hypnotic induction. think lot hypnosis EMDR. - Ah. -
think, combination exposure based treatments, use
EMDR think it. tend not process experience much just
physical part it, personally think drawback. And, every study seen
dismantling study. no question people go EMDR, many
get better trauma related problems VA big program using
on. every program dismantled, going treatment
lateral eye movement, shown lateral eye movement, doesn't add
anything it. toward end career, Francine [indistinct]
contralateral touching something, wasn't eye movements anymore.
things. So, tend think that, EMDR another form exposure based therapy
trauma, implied exception possible new data, certainly
doesn't with, rapid eye movement sleep. don't think moving eyes
issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put
weight this, going re-injure ankle example, simply mean
body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat
something coming opportunity something ameliorate situation. So,
not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding
happening. face also say, opportunity
something it. minute realistically enha- doesn't mean,
imagine away heart attack. means figure rehabilitate heart attack


broken leg something like way get much control

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body
floating, safe comfortable. Now, picture Mary sit feeling sadness
no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids

couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication

evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people

saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people

give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,

meantime, people interested exploring clinical hypnosis, working
somebody similar? centralized resource people can go find, really
well-trained hypnotists? - two good professional organizations will help
that. One society clinical experimental hypnosis. think

01:01:50 ‘Hypnotizability’, Spiegel Eye-roll Test



- somehow things take meaning. - [David] Right. - So, talked about,
utility hypnosis stress reduction, phobias, pain, possibly, don't know for,
things like ADHD OCD, just will depend hypnotizability. - Right. - talked
beautiful study the, metastatic breast cancer outcome patients.
Hypnotizability clearly key variable. - Yes. - please tell us,
hypnotizability is, evaluated Spiegel Eye-Roll Test is? - Okay,
sure. So, hypnotizability just capacity hypnotic experiences.
test called hypnotic conduction profile. give highly structured hypnotic
experience. old tradition clinical hypnosis was, try bunch
different things, talking, walking upstairs downstairs images time
say breathing subject that. change
clinician, less can make variation outcome. take
long time, know, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. just view kind complex,
not effective way assessing person's hypnotic capacity. know
peak period hypnotizability human life, latency years childhood. So,
every eight year old trance time. call 'em dinner, don't
hear ya, thing. childhood wonderful
experience. Work play thing. try make little
adults, think terrible mistake. Everything fun them. enjoy learning,
enjoy everything. - age this- - like 6 10, 6 11.
playful, enjoy everything. Everything sort game fun try
make miserable them, got it. when, Piaget called,
adult cognitive framework, learn abstract concepts, learn even one
bottle looks bigger other, can equal volume. so, imposing
logic, growing DLPFC point imposing cognitive structure
experience. people start lose hypnotic ability. time
early 20s, hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed. study done
Stanford, Ernest Hillard, Phil Zimbardo this, looking at, tracked
students psych one, hypnotizability measured retested
blindly 25 years later. test, retest correlation was, want guess
was? - guessing it's, don't know, 0.6 something. - Yeah, close. 0.7, IQ
0.6, 25 year interval. - Wow. - So, stable IQ 25
year interval. So, point, are. factors


lead that? Well, means that, third adults just
not hypnotizable. Two thirds are, 15% extremely hypnotizable can
measure give number 0 10. useful.
patients it, say, look, sorry, not hypnotizable going
something else. Medication, systematic desensitization, mindfulness, things
hypnotizable, just go it. don't lot explaining. People
low moderate hypnotizable, like explanations doing,
can still get benefits. So, helps guide nature treatment
people. Now, eye roll is, father used use eye fixation induction, used
say, look ceiling now close eyes looking up. very,
yes, very- - Yeah [indistinct] [laughs]. - noticed two patients back
back. one woman seen work with, hysterical seizures.
just suddenly start shaking. And- - Real epileptic seizures? - No, pseudo
epileptic seizures. - see, hysteria. - Hysteria, although people both,
the, people, real epilepsy becomes framework gets elaborated on,
stressed, seizures. just pseudo epilepsy, no EEG
abnormalities. really something watch. husband move
work bench near door, started seizure, run home
try help it. bad. noticed
did, looked up, one seizure events, see
sclera, don't see Iris anymore. start seize. great thing
her. taught seizures. Everybody else telling stop.
made one. hypnotized her, [indistinct] go back last time
one sure enough, start shake. gradually make smaller
smaller. So, learning control, access, like
PTSD, confront, don't avoid it, don't suppress it. confront figure
deal it. next patient rigid obsessional businessman
wanted stop controlling [chuckles], reminded me,
New Yorker cartoon driver, comes yield sign yells, "Never!"
always [indistinct]. - sounds right, New Yorker. - Yeah, New
Yorker. so, guy, tried look up, couldn't keep eyes
closed them. so, father started testing people. seemed
rough correlation capacity keep eyes up, closed
measured hypnotizability. - people listening [stutters], watching


video. So, Spiegel Eye-Roll Test, involves looking ceiling. So, tilting
head back, tilting chin back looking ceiling now. also
directing eyes upward eyes open. eye roll test involves
then, closing eyelids eyes open. - open. - whether not,
eyes roll back said it, see sclera, white part. - see sclera,
white part. - means you're, hypnotizable moderately hypnotizable. -
Right. - Whereas eyes move see iris, colored part eye
eyes close, less hypnotizable. - Right. - can look online there, just
put Spiegel Eye-Roll Test find it. also going actual
example hypnosis video later. - Right. So, asking brain something
difficult, keep eyes closing eyelids. contradictory signals
third, fourth sixth cranial nerve nuclei control eye movement. - said
third- - Fourth six, - Yup. - cranial nerve nuclei. suspending one
activity, asking another eye movements lot levels
consciousness. periaqueductal gray, surrounds cranial nerve nuclei.
close eyes sleep, rapid eye movement dream.
drugs, affect level consciousness, can affect eyes eye movements,
either dilation contraction pupils, depending whether stimulant
opioid. - Stimulants, make pupils big. - Big, right? - Yeah. Like cocaine,
amphetamine. - Right, exactly. - Things sort. - opioids, get constricted
pupils. - parents looking kids coming door late night,
looking substance abuse. - right. - Yeah. - So, something
eyes lot level consciousness. mean, obviously, close
eyes go sleep, rapid eye movement dreaming.
So, not surprising. old Zen practice called, looking third eye.
think part reason happens is, looking inside like
third eye two forehead. think
visual creatures, pretty pathetic physical point view. Many animals
can outrun us, outs smell us eagles read newsprint hundred yards
can't. So, major defensive sensory input vision. animals,
predator animals eyes front head, good,
detailed vision prey. Whereas prey animals like deer, eyes side
head. So, don't see things well, much bigger range potential
see threat. mainly use, fact, interesting, social


anthropologists say, gather do, coastlines edge
forest something, got protection back. Something can
attack one side big vision might threaten you.
tend attracted kinds physical situations, so- - Yeah, love vistas. -
love vistas, right. - Vistas calming. take us panoramic

location national parks people naturally aggregated was-
makes sense. - Sure. - But, signs locations built around, people's
tendency animals tendencies. - Oh, really [indistinct]? - aggregate there. Yeah,
interesting book history national parks says, didn't
give research study support it, no Google Maps, obviously. -
interesting. - Yeah, panorama visual boundaries really interesting. think,
eyes, know, two pieces central nervous system brain,
outside the- - Right. used say eyes outside skull neuro-

isn't neuroanatomy course maybe go little deeper there. So, said
contradictory activity, looking controlled one set cranial nerves.
closing eyelids, controlled another cranial nerve. - No,
one. think six close eyes, activate, no, facial,
guess facial nerve. 7, yeah. - 7, yeah. - looking up, activating
muscles force eyes look up. closing eyelids normally relaxes
those, relaxes upper movement, eyes closed don't
need it. breaking usual customary pattern. - like rubbing the, -
Right. - hey, can't even it, see like the, - Right. [Andrew David laughing] -
exactly right. - Rubbing tummy patting head. bit
conflict there, - Right. - clinically, good probe you, - has. -
father. So, Spiegel senior Spiegel junior? - Spiegel senior. -
developed Spiegel Eye-Roll Test. - key issue this, normally
close eyes also, going sleep. not worried going
world anymore. Here, maintaining resting alertness. So, focusing
turning inward. unusual state. Normally close eyes periodically,
to, close eyes period time, normally go


sleep not worried detecting risk threat. So, interesting state
turning inward, basically, looking up, shutting eyes
allowing whatever happens outside happen focusing
going inward. So, think signal brain turn inward. - interesting.
meditation course, done eyes open almost always done
eyes closed. - Yes, right. - interesting. So, can quickly determine
whether not someone highly hypnotizable. - Right. - not hypnotizable.
said two thirds people can hypnotized. - Right. - Obviously third cannot.
within two thirds can, range, said 15% people fall
this, highly hypnotizable category. - Right, correct. - seem member
of. - Yeah. - And, repeated use self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis, increase
change hypnotizability, can access first place? - say
general, may increase little bit, not hell lot, not worth effort
increase hypnotizability point. worth trying deal problem,
dealing with. So, can get better using level have.
study done tried train people hypnotizable
obviously, there're subjective behavioral components test, can learn
little better them. found reanalyze data,
account three times final score, based initial hypnotizability
measurement, rather whether not trained better. So,
can improve little

01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)

not worth trouble. - Got it. Along lines eyes eye movements, lot
interest EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. -
Shapiro working, wasn't Stanford directly, local
Stanford. - Yeah. - think Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - thoughts
EMDR? useful, think less useful? things
EMDR combined make useful? listeners podcast
come to, think, come podcast range backgrounds interests. me,
makes sense EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given newer
data can suppress amygdala activity animals animal models
humans well. really hasn't explored much, neurally. heard things like,


coordinates two sides brain, it, just throwaway. don't think
evidence that, coordinating two sides brain better not
coordinating. wouldn't speaking right now two sides brain, well
correlated. - Yeah. - language lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - heard
mimics, rapid eye movements sleep, actually doesn't. So, - Right. -
heard people talk positive experiences EMDR.
thoughts EMDR? - Yeah, good comment one recent
podcasts. tell you, one way sort think bemused point view,
old, mentioned earlier, oldest sort idea hypnotic induction,
dangling watch, right? [indistinct] watch. And, fact, enough concern
automobiles invented, movement prevent
installing windshield wipers people afraid hypnotized,
watched windshield wipers go back forth car. Now, turns
fortunately that, tend not look windshield wipers. keep looking
windshield. so, windshield wipers today. movement is,
exactly used hypnotic induction. think lot hypnosis EMDR. - Ah. -
think, combination exposure based treatments, use
EMDR think it. tend not process experience much just
physical part it, personally think drawback. And, every study seen
dismantling study. no question people go EMDR, many

things. So, tend think that, EMDR another form exposure based therapy
trauma, implied exception possible new data, certainly
doesn't with, rapid eye movement sleep. don't think moving eyes
issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put
weight this, going re-injure ankle example, simply mean
body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat
something coming opportunity something ameliorate situation. So,
not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding
happening. face also say, opportunity
something it. minute realistically enha- doesn't mean,
imagine away heart attack. means figure rehabilitate heart attack

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body
floating, safe comfortable. Now, picture Mary sit feeling sadness
no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year

so, get struggling fights. course struggle,

children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter

children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,
watch it, try [stutters]. work enjoying together shows
breathing patterns may increase sympathetic arousal may decrease. may
[indistinct] cyclic sighing seems to, actually, time spent exhaling

think inducing perhaps perceiving well. So, no,
absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go
automatically can control it. so, kind way us demonstrate
ourselves, greater ways modulating internal state. So, can either it,
thinking it, way pain control hypnosis can

want see happen body. So, like right margin,
can enhance, me, like way augmenting hypnosis,
medication, think powerful way that. - Great, really excited see
goes. - Yes. - Breathing, vision, bodily states clearly the-
directed mental focus, seem key elements hypnosis. missing


ingredients? - Yeah, think right. - It's- - Breathing, vision, - Breathing, vision,
change vision don't, know, typically physically relaxed
state, frankly people peak performance, including physical athletic
performance musical performance hypnotic states too. talked
classical pianists say, not thinking, start thinking fingers
now, screw up. floating piano, thinking tone want
feel exuding instrument. hypnotic like state too. many athletes
peak performance, just flowing it. not thinking step step,
doing? best working
giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much
always you. can people learn about, can get
hypnotized? mentioned Reveri, put link it, R-E-V-E-R-I.com way
access that. - Reveri app app store, way. reveri.com
website, can get download Reveri app app
store. - Great. So, currently apple, hopefully soon, also Android,
meantime, people interested exploring clinical hypnosis, working
somebody similar? centralized resource people can go find, really
well-trained hypnotists? - two good professional organizations will help
that. One society clinical experimental hypnosis. think
sceh.us their- - Okay, look provide link. - American society
clinical hypnosis, provide referral services professionals. can look
up. just say general, look someone licensed trained
primary professional discipline, psychiatry, psychology, medicine, dentistry
training interest using hypnosis, way it. - Great one
question comment. question is, will psychiatrist? - [laughs]
honored. - tall task. might stubborn patient. - think hardest
work's already done, Andrew. - Thank you. - fine, now. - appreciate that.
[David laughing] Well, final thing comment. First all, thank much
today, sharing knowledge. - welcome. - hope can

Likewise [indistinct]. - speak, learn know others well. -
Thank you. - will put resources get also just want say, thank


work do. - Well, thank you. - incredible thing world

mysterious people struggling lot things, also think people
really excited about, applying tools like hypnosis perform better, feel better mentally
physically. pointed us tremendous amount resources

you. know professional commitment life benefit. So, thank
so. - Well, thank you, real joy collaborating
using precision knowledge neuroanatomy, neurobiology
address problems often people disciplined primary

- somehow things take meaning. - [David] Right. - So, talked about,
utility hypnosis stress reduction, phobias, pain, possibly, don't know for,
things like ADHD OCD, just will depend hypnotizability. - Right. - talked
beautiful study the, metastatic breast cancer outcome patients.
Hypnotizability clearly key variable. - Yes. - please tell us,
hypnotizability is, evaluated Spiegel Eye-Roll Test is? - Okay,
sure. So, hypnotizability just capacity hypnotic experiences.
test called hypnotic conduction profile. give highly structured hypnotic
experience. old tradition clinical hypnosis was, try bunch
different things, talking, walking upstairs downstairs images time
say breathing subject that. change
clinician, less can make variation outcome. take
long time, know, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. just view kind complex,
not effective way assessing person's hypnotic capacity. know

every eight year old trance time. call 'em dinner, don't
hear ya, thing. childhood wonderful

adults, think terrible mistake. Everything fun them. enjoy learning,
enjoy everything. - age this- - like 6 10, 6 11.
playful, enjoy everything. Everything sort game fun try
make miserable them, got it. when, Piaget called,
adult cognitive framework, learn abstract concepts, learn even one
bottle looks bigger other, can equal volume. so, imposing
logic, growing DLPFC point imposing cognitive structure
experience. people start lose hypnotic ability. time
early 20s, hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed. study done
Stanford, Ernest Hillard, Phil Zimbardo this, looking at, tracked
students psych one, hypnotizability measured retested
blindly 25 years later. test, retest correlation was, want guess
was? - guessing it's, don't know, 0.6 something. - Yeah, close. 0.7, IQ
0.6, 25 year interval. - Wow. - So, stable IQ 25
year interval. So, point, are. factors


lead that? Well, means that, third adults just
not hypnotizable. Two thirds are, 15% extremely hypnotizable can
measure give number 0 10. useful.
patients it, say, look, sorry, not hypnotizable going
something else. Medication, systematic desensitization, mindfulness, things
hypnotizable, just go it. don't lot explaining. People
low moderate hypnotizable, like explanations doing,
can still get benefits. So, helps guide nature treatment
people. Now, eye roll is, father used use eye fixation induction, used
say, look ceiling now close eyes looking up. very,
yes, very- - Yeah [indistinct] [laughs]. - noticed two patients back
back. one woman seen work with, hysterical seizures.
just suddenly start shaking. And- - Real epileptic seizures? - No, pseudo
epileptic seizures. - see, hysteria. - Hysteria, although people both,
the, people, real epilepsy becomes framework gets elaborated on,
stressed, seizures. just pseudo epilepsy, no EEG
abnormalities. really something watch. husband move
work bench near door, started seizure, run home
try help it. bad. noticed
did, looked up, one seizure events, see
sclera, don't see Iris anymore. start seize. great thing
her. taught seizures. Everybody else telling stop.
made one. hypnotized her, [indistinct] go back last time
one sure enough, start shake. gradually make smaller
smaller. So, learning control, access, like
PTSD, confront, don't avoid it, don't suppress it. confront figure
deal it. next patient rigid obsessional businessman
wanted stop controlling [chuckles], reminded me,
New Yorker cartoon driver, comes yield sign yells, "Never!"
always [indistinct]. - sounds right, New Yorker. - Yeah, New
Yorker. so, guy, tried look up, couldn't keep eyes
closed them. so, father started testing people. seemed
rough correlation capacity keep eyes up, closed
measured hypnotizability. - people listening [stutters], watching


video. So, Spiegel Eye-Roll Test, involves looking ceiling. So, tilting
head back, tilting chin back looking ceiling now. also
directing eyes upward eyes open. eye roll test involves
then, closing eyelids eyes open. - open. - whether not,
eyes roll back said it, see sclera, white part. - see sclera,
white part. - means you're, hypnotizable moderately hypnotizable. -
Right. - Whereas eyes move see iris, colored part eye
eyes close, less hypnotizable. - Right. - can look online there, just
put Spiegel Eye-Roll Test find it. also going actual
example hypnosis video later. - Right. So, asking brain something
difficult, keep eyes closing eyelids. contradictory signals
third, fourth sixth cranial nerve nuclei control eye movement. - said
third- - Fourth six, - Yup. - cranial nerve nuclei. suspending one
activity, asking another eye movements lot levels
consciousness. periaqueductal gray, surrounds cranial nerve nuclei.
close eyes sleep, rapid eye movement dream.
drugs, affect level consciousness, can affect eyes eye movements,
either dilation contraction pupils, depending whether stimulant
opioid. - Stimulants, make pupils big. - Big, right? - Yeah. Like cocaine,
amphetamine. - Right, exactly. - Things sort. - opioids, get constricted
pupils. - parents looking kids coming door late night,
looking substance abuse. - right. - Yeah. - So, something
eyes lot level consciousness. mean, obviously, close
eyes go sleep, rapid eye movement dreaming.
So, not surprising. old Zen practice called, looking third eye.
think part reason happens is, looking inside like
third eye two forehead. think
visual creatures, pretty pathetic physical point view. Many animals
can outrun us, outs smell us eagles read newsprint hundred yards
can't. So, major defensive sensory input vision. animals,
predator animals eyes front head, good,
detailed vision prey. Whereas prey animals like deer, eyes side
head. So, don't see things well, much bigger range potential
see threat. mainly use, fact, interesting, social


anthropologists say, gather do, coastlines edge
forest something, got protection back. Something can
attack one side big vision might threaten you.
tend attracted kinds physical situations, so- - Yeah, love vistas. -
love vistas, right. - Vistas calming. take us panoramic
vision. - right. - didn't know this, turns scenic spots
location national parks people naturally aggregated was-
makes sense. - Sure. - But, signs locations built around, people's
tendency animals tendencies. - Oh, really [indistinct]? - aggregate there. Yeah,
interesting book history national parks says, didn't
give research study support it, no Google Maps, obviously. -
interesting. - Yeah, panorama visual boundaries really interesting. think,
eyes, know, two pieces central nervous system brain,
outside the- - Right. used say eyes outside skull neuro-
ophthalmologist wrote vehemently pointed outside
cranial vault, so, know. outside cranial vault two pieces
brain there. so, mentioned cranial nerves, three, four six.
isn't neuroanatomy course maybe go little deeper there. So, said
contradictory activity, looking controlled one set cranial nerves.
closing eyelids, controlled another cranial nerve. - No,
one. think six close eyes, activate, no, facial,
guess facial nerve. 7, yeah. - 7, yeah. - looking up, activating
muscles force eyes look up. closing eyelids normally relaxes
those, relaxes upper movement, eyes closed don't
need it. breaking usual customary pattern. - like rubbing the, -
Right. - hey, can't even it, see like the, - Right. [Andrew David laughing] -
exactly right. - Rubbing tummy patting head. bit
conflict there, - Right. - clinically, good probe you, - has. -
father. So, Spiegel senior Spiegel junior? - Spiegel senior. -
developed Spiegel Eye-Roll Test. - key issue this, normally
close eyes also, going sleep. not worried going
world anymore. Here, maintaining resting alertness. So, focusing
turning inward. unusual state. Normally close eyes periodically,
to, close eyes period time, normally go


sleep not worried detecting risk threat. So, interesting state
turning inward, basically, looking up, shutting eyes
allowing whatever happens outside happen focusing
going inward. So, think signal brain turn inward. - interesting.
meditation course, done eyes open almost always done
eyes closed. - Yes, right. - interesting. So, can quickly determine
whether not someone highly hypnotizable. - Right. - not hypnotizable.
said two thirds people can hypnotized. - Right. - Obviously third cannot.
within two thirds can, range, said 15% people fall
this, highly hypnotizable category. - Right, correct. - seem member
of. - Yeah. - And, repeated use self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis, increase
change hypnotizability, can access first place? - say
general, may increase little bit, not hell lot, not worth effort
increase hypnotizability point. worth trying deal problem,
dealing with. So, can get better using level have.
study done tried train people hypnotizable
obviously, there're subjective behavioral components test, can learn
little better them. found reanalyze data,
account three times final score, based initial hypnotizability
measurement, rather whether not trained better. So,
can improve little

01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)

not worth trouble. - Got it. Along lines eyes eye movements, lot
interest EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. -
Shapiro working, wasn't Stanford directly, local
Stanford. - Yeah. - think Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - thoughts
EMDR? useful, think less useful? things
EMDR combined make useful? listeners podcast
come to, think, come podcast range backgrounds interests. me,
makes sense EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given newer
data can suppress amygdala activity animals animal models
humans well. really hasn't explored much, neurally. heard things like,


coordinates two sides brain, it, just throwaway. don't think
evidence that, coordinating two sides brain better not
coordinating. wouldn't speaking right now two sides brain, well
correlated. - Yeah. - language lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - heard
mimics, rapid eye movements sleep, actually doesn't. So, - Right. -
heard people talk positive experiences EMDR.
thoughts EMDR? - Yeah, good comment one recent
podcasts. tell you, one way sort think bemused point view,
old, mentioned earlier, oldest sort idea hypnotic induction,
dangling watch, right? [indistinct] watch. And, fact, enough concern
automobiles invented, movement prevent
installing windshield wipers people afraid hypnotized,
watched windshield wipers go back forth car. Now, turns
fortunately that, tend not look windshield wipers. keep looking
windshield. so, windshield wipers today. movement is,
exactly used hypnotic induction. think lot hypnosis EMDR. - Ah. -
think, combination exposure based treatments, use
EMDR think it. tend not process experience much just
physical part it, personally think drawback. And, every study seen
dismantling study. no question people go EMDR, many
get better trauma related problems VA big program using
on. every program dismantled, going treatment
lateral eye movement, shown lateral eye movement, doesn't add
anything it. toward end career, Francine [indistinct]
contralateral touching something, wasn't eye movements anymore.
things. So, tend think that, EMDR another form exposure based therapy
trauma, implied exception possible new data, certainly
doesn't with, rapid eye movement sleep. don't think moving eyes
issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put
weight this, going re-injure ankle example, simply mean
body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat
something coming opportunity something ameliorate situation. So,
not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding
happening. face also say, opportunity
something it. minute realistically enha- doesn't mean,
imagine away heart attack. means figure rehabilitate heart attack


broken leg something like way get much control

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body
floating, safe comfortable. Now, picture Mary sit feeling sadness
no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,
watch it, try [stutters]. work enjoying together shows
breathing patterns may increase sympathetic arousal may decrease. may
[indistinct] cyclic sighing seems to, actually, time spent exhaling
inhaling. reason believe induces parasympathetic activity,
'cause increasing pressure chest therefore allowing heart slow
blood returned atrium easily. use it. ask people
take deep breath part induction slowly exhale. partly
result research together, emphasizing slow exhale more, part
[stutters], enhance idea induction period relaxation, 'cause
think inducing perhaps perceiving well. So, no,
absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go
automatically can control it. so, kind way us demonstrate
ourselves, greater ways modulating internal state. So, can either it,
thinking it, way pain control hypnosis can
extent, taking charge breathing things will produce change
want see happen body. So, like right margin,
can enhance, me, like way augmenting hypnosis,
medication, think powerful way that. - Great, really excited see
goes. - Yes. - Breathing, vision, bodily states clearly the-
directed mental focus, seem key elements hypnosis. missing


ingredients? - Yeah, think right. - It's- - Breathing, vision, - Breathing, vision,
change vision don't, know, typically physically relaxed
state, frankly people peak performance, including physical athletic
performance musical performance hypnotic states too. talked
classical pianists say, not thinking, start thinking fingers
now, screw up. floating piano, thinking tone want
feel exuding instrument. hypnotic like state too. many athletes
peak performance, just flowing it. not thinking step step,
doing? best working
giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much
always you. can people learn about, can get
hypnotized? mentioned Reveri, put link it, R-E-V-E-R-I.com way
access that. - Reveri app app store, way. reveri.com
website, can get download Reveri app app
store. - Great. So, currently apple, hopefully soon, also Android,
meantime, people interested exploring clinical hypnosis, working
somebody similar? centralized resource people can go find, really
well-trained hypnotists? - two good professional organizations will help
that. One society clinical experimental hypnosis. think
sceh.us their- - Okay, look provide link. - American society
clinical hypnosis, provide referral services professionals. can look
up. just say general, look someone licensed trained
primary professional discipline, psychiatry, psychology, medicine, dentistry
training interest using hypnosis, way it. - Great one
question comment. question is, will psychiatrist? - [laughs]
honored. - tall task. might stubborn patient. - think hardest
work's already done, Andrew. - Thank you. - fine, now. - appreciate that.
[David laughing] Well, final thing comment. First all, thank much
today, sharing knowledge. - welcome. - hope can
again. - hope so. - love working laboratory you. -
Likewise [indistinct]. - speak, learn know others well. -
Thank you. - will put resources get also just want say, thank


work do. - Well, thank you. - incredible thing world

mysterious people struggling lot things, also think people
really excited about, applying tools like hypnosis perform better, feel better mentally
physically. pointed us tremendous amount resources
tools work already demonstrated work. just, thank
you. know professional commitment life benefit. So, thank
so. - Well, thank you, real joy collaborating
using precision knowledge neuroanatomy, neurobiology
address problems often people disciplined primary
neurobiological end, aren't interested are. so, really pleasure
try bring together know different perspectives build
something neither us alone. so, real joy it. -

patients it, say, look, sorry, not hypnotizable going
something else. Medication, systematic desensitization, mindfulness, things
hypnotizable, just go it. don't lot explaining. People
low moderate hypnotizable, like explanations doing,
can still get benefits. So, helps guide nature treatment

say, look ceiling now close eyes looking up. very,
yes, very- - Yeah [indistinct] [laughs]. - noticed two patients back
back. one woman seen work with, hysterical seizures.
just suddenly start shaking. And- - Real epileptic seizures? - No, pseudo
epileptic seizures. - see, hysteria. - Hysteria, although people both,
the, people, real epilepsy becomes framework gets elaborated on,
stressed, seizures. just pseudo epilepsy, no EEG

wanted stop controlling [chuckles], reminded me,
New Yorker cartoon driver, comes yield sign yells, "Never!"
always [indistinct]. - sounds right, New Yorker. - Yeah, New
Yorker. so, guy, tried look up, couldn't keep eyes
closed them. so, father started testing people. seemed
rough correlation capacity keep eyes up, closed
measured hypnotizability. - people listening [stutters], watching


video. So, Spiegel Eye-Roll Test, involves looking ceiling. So, tilting
head back, tilting chin back looking ceiling now. also
directing eyes upward eyes open. eye roll test involves
then, closing eyelids eyes open. - open. - whether not,
eyes roll back said it, see sclera, white part. - see sclera,
white part. - means you're, hypnotizable moderately hypnotizable. -
Right. - Whereas eyes move see iris, colored part eye
eyes close, less hypnotizable. - Right. - can look online there, just
put Spiegel Eye-Roll Test find it. also going actual
example hypnosis video later. - Right. So, asking brain something
difficult, keep eyes closing eyelids. contradictory signals
third, fourth sixth cranial nerve nuclei control eye movement. - said
third- - Fourth six, - Yup. - cranial nerve nuclei. suspending one
activity, asking another eye movements lot levels
consciousness. periaqueductal gray, surrounds cranial nerve nuclei.
close eyes sleep, rapid eye movement dream.
drugs, affect level consciousness, can affect eyes eye movements,
either dilation contraction pupils, depending whether stimulant
opioid. - Stimulants, make pupils big. - Big, right? - Yeah. Like cocaine,
amphetamine. - Right, exactly. - Things sort. - opioids, get constricted
pupils. - parents looking kids coming door late night,
looking substance abuse. - right. - Yeah. - So, something
eyes lot level consciousness. mean, obviously, close
eyes go sleep, rapid eye movement dreaming.
So, not surprising. old Zen practice called, looking third eye.
think part reason happens is, looking inside like
third eye two forehead. think
visual creatures, pretty pathetic physical point view. Many animals
can outrun us, outs smell us eagles read newsprint hundred yards
can't. So, major defensive sensory input vision. animals,
predator animals eyes front head, good,
detailed vision prey. Whereas prey animals like deer, eyes side
head. So, don't see things well, much bigger range potential
see threat. mainly use, fact, interesting, social

attack one side big vision might threaten you.
tend attracted kinds physical situations, so- - Yeah, love vistas. -
love vistas, right. - Vistas calming. take us panoramic

location national parks people naturally aggregated was-
makes sense. - Sure. - But, signs locations built around, people's
tendency animals tendencies. - Oh, really [indistinct]? - aggregate there. Yeah,
interesting book history national parks says, didn't
give research study support it, no Google Maps, obviously. -
interesting. - Yeah, panorama visual boundaries really interesting. think,
eyes, know, two pieces central nervous system brain,
outside the- - Right. used say eyes outside skull neuro-

contradictory activity, looking controlled one set cranial nerves.
closing eyelids, controlled another cranial nerve. - No,
one. think six close eyes, activate, no, facial,

Right. - hey, can't even it, see like the, - Right. [Andrew David laughing] -
exactly right. - Rubbing tummy patting head. bit

father. So, Spiegel senior Spiegel junior? - Spiegel senior. -
developed Spiegel Eye-Roll Test. - key issue this, normally
close eyes also, going sleep. not worried going
world anymore. Here, maintaining resting alertness. So, focusing
turning inward. unusual state. Normally close eyes periodically,
to, close eyes period time, normally go


sleep not worried detecting risk threat. So, interesting state
turning inward, basically, looking up, shutting eyes
allowing whatever happens outside happen focusing
going inward. So, think signal brain turn inward. - interesting.
meditation course, done eyes open almost always done
eyes closed. - Yes, right. - interesting. So, can quickly determine
whether not someone highly hypnotizable. - Right. - not hypnotizable.
said two thirds people can hypnotized. - Right. - Obviously third cannot.
within two thirds can, range, said 15% people fall
this, highly hypnotizable category. - Right, correct. - seem member
of. - Yeah. - And, repeated use self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis, increase
change hypnotizability, can access first place? - say
general, may increase little bit, not hell lot, not worth effort
increase hypnotizability point. worth trying deal problem,
dealing with. So, can get better using level have.
study done tried train people hypnotizable
obviously, there're subjective behavioral components test, can learn
little better them. found reanalyze data,
account three times final score, based initial hypnotizability
measurement, rather whether not trained better. So,
can improve little

01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)

not worth trouble. - Got it. Along lines eyes eye movements, lot
interest EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. -
Shapiro working, wasn't Stanford directly, local
Stanford. - Yeah. - think Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - thoughts
EMDR? useful, think less useful? things
EMDR combined make useful? listeners podcast
come to, think, come podcast range backgrounds interests. me,
makes sense EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given newer
data can suppress amygdala activity animals animal models
humans well. really hasn't explored much, neurally. heard things like,


coordinates two sides brain, it, just throwaway. don't think
evidence that, coordinating two sides brain better not
coordinating. wouldn't speaking right now two sides brain, well
correlated. - Yeah. - language lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - heard
mimics, rapid eye movements sleep, actually doesn't. So, - Right. -
heard people talk positive experiences EMDR.
thoughts EMDR? - Yeah, good comment one recent
podcasts. tell you, one way sort think bemused point view,
old, mentioned earlier, oldest sort idea hypnotic induction,
dangling watch, right? [indistinct] watch. And, fact, enough concern
automobiles invented, movement prevent
installing windshield wipers people afraid hypnotized,
watched windshield wipers go back forth car. Now, turns
fortunately that, tend not look windshield wipers. keep looking
windshield. so, windshield wipers today. movement is,
exactly used hypnotic induction. think lot hypnosis EMDR. - Ah. -
think, combination exposure based treatments, use
EMDR think it. tend not process experience much just
physical part it, personally think drawback. And, every study seen
dismantling study. no question people go EMDR, many
get better trauma related problems VA big program using
on. every program dismantled, going treatment
lateral eye movement, shown lateral eye movement, doesn't add
anything it. toward end career, Francine [indistinct]
contralateral touching something, wasn't eye movements anymore.
things. So, tend think that, EMDR another form exposure based therapy
trauma, implied exception possible new data, certainly
doesn't with, rapid eye movement sleep. don't think moving eyes
issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put
weight this, going re-injure ankle example, simply mean
body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat
something coming opportunity something ameliorate situation. So,
not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding
happening. face also say, opportunity
something it. minute realistically enha- doesn't mean,
imagine away heart attack. means figure rehabilitate heart attack


broken leg something like way get much control

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body
floating, safe comfortable. Now, picture Mary sit feeling sadness
no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication

evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.

give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort

01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,
watch it, try [stutters]. work enjoying together shows
breathing patterns may increase sympathetic arousal may decrease. may
[indistinct] cyclic sighing seems to, actually, time spent exhaling
inhaling. reason believe induces parasympathetic activity,
'cause increasing pressure chest therefore allowing heart slow
blood returned atrium easily. use it. ask people
take deep breath part induction slowly exhale. partly
result research together, emphasizing slow exhale more, part
[stutters], enhance idea induction period relaxation, 'cause
think inducing perhaps perceiving well. So, no,
absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go
automatically can control it. so, kind way us demonstrate
ourselves, greater ways modulating internal state. So, can either it,
thinking it, way pain control hypnosis can
extent, taking charge breathing things will produce change
want see happen body. So, like right margin,
can enhance, me, like way augmenting hypnosis,
medication, think powerful way that. - Great, really excited see
goes. - Yes. - Breathing, vision, bodily states clearly the-
directed mental focus, seem key elements hypnosis. missing


ingredients? - Yeah, think right. - It's- - Breathing, vision, - Breathing, vision,
change vision don't, know, typically physically relaxed
state, frankly people peak performance, including physical athletic
performance musical performance hypnotic states too. talked
classical pianists say, not thinking, start thinking fingers
now, screw up. floating piano, thinking tone want
feel exuding instrument. hypnotic like state too. many athletes
peak performance, just flowing it. not thinking step step,
doing? best working
giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much
always you. can people learn about, can get

meantime, people interested exploring clinical hypnosis, working
somebody similar? centralized resource people can go find, really
well-trained hypnotists? - two good professional organizations will help
that. One society clinical experimental hypnosis. think
sceh.us their- - Okay, look provide link. - American society

head back, tilting chin back looking ceiling now. also
directing eyes upward eyes open. eye roll test involves
then, closing eyelids eyes open. - open. - whether not,
eyes roll back said it, see sclera, white part. - see sclera,
white part. - means you're, hypnotizable moderately hypnotizable. -
Right. - Whereas eyes move see iris, colored part eye
eyes close, less hypnotizable. - Right. - can look online there, just
put Spiegel Eye-Roll Test find it. also going actual
example hypnosis video later. - Right. So, asking brain something
difficult, keep eyes closing eyelids. contradictory signals
third, fourth sixth cranial nerve nuclei control eye movement. - said
third- - Fourth six, - Yup. - cranial nerve nuclei. suspending one

close eyes sleep, rapid eye movement dream.
drugs, affect level consciousness, can affect eyes eye movements,
either dilation contraction pupils, depending whether stimulant

amphetamine. - Right, exactly. - Things sort. - opioids, get constricted
pupils. - parents looking kids coming door late night,
looking substance abuse. - right. - Yeah. - So, something
eyes lot level consciousness. mean, obviously, close
eyes go sleep, rapid eye movement dreaming.
So, not surprising. old Zen practice called, looking third eye.
think part reason happens is, looking inside like
third eye two forehead. think
visual creatures, pretty pathetic physical point view. Many animals

predator animals eyes front head, good,
detailed vision prey. Whereas prey animals like deer, eyes side

love vistas, right. - Vistas calming. take us panoramic

location national parks people naturally aggregated was-
makes sense. - Sure. - But, signs locations built around, people's
tendency animals tendencies. - Oh, really [indistinct]? - aggregate there. Yeah,
interesting book history national parks says, didn't
give research study support it, no Google Maps, obviously. -
interesting. - Yeah, panorama visual boundaries really interesting. think,
eyes, know, two pieces central nervous system brain,

contradictory activity, looking controlled one set cranial nerves.
closing eyelids, controlled another cranial nerve. - No,
one. think six close eyes, activate, no, facial,

close eyes also, going sleep. not worried going

turning inward. unusual state. Normally close eyes periodically,
to, close eyes period time, normally go


sleep not worried detecting risk threat. So, interesting state
turning inward, basically, looking up, shutting eyes
allowing whatever happens outside happen focusing
going inward. So, think signal brain turn inward. - interesting.
meditation course, done eyes open almost always done
eyes closed. - Yes, right. - interesting. So, can quickly determine
whether not someone highly hypnotizable. - Right. - not hypnotizable.
said two thirds people can hypnotized. - Right. - Obviously third cannot.
within two thirds can, range, said 15% people fall
this, highly hypnotizable category. - Right, correct. - seem member

change hypnotizability, can access first place? - say
general, may increase little bit, not hell lot, not worth effort
increase hypnotizability point. worth trying deal problem,
dealing with. So, can get better using level have.
study done tried train people hypnotizable
obviously, there're subjective behavioral components test, can learn
little better them. found reanalyze data,
account three times final score, based initial hypnotizability
measurement, rather whether not trained better. So,
can improve little

01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)

not worth trouble. - Got it. Along lines eyes eye movements, lot
interest EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. -
Shapiro working, wasn't Stanford directly, local
Stanford. - Yeah. - think Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - thoughts
EMDR? useful, think less useful? things
EMDR combined make useful? listeners podcast
come to, think, come podcast range backgrounds interests. me,
makes sense EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given newer
data can suppress amygdala activity animals animal models
humans well. really hasn't explored much, neurally. heard things like,


coordinates two sides brain, it, just throwaway. don't think
evidence that, coordinating two sides brain better not
coordinating. wouldn't speaking right now two sides brain, well
correlated. - Yeah. - language lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - heard
mimics, rapid eye movements sleep, actually doesn't. So, - Right. -
heard people talk positive experiences EMDR.
thoughts EMDR? - Yeah, good comment one recent
podcasts. tell you, one way sort think bemused point view,
old, mentioned earlier, oldest sort idea hypnotic induction,
dangling watch, right? [indistinct] watch. And, fact, enough concern
automobiles invented, movement prevent
installing windshield wipers people afraid hypnotized,
watched windshield wipers go back forth car. Now, turns
fortunately that, tend not look windshield wipers. keep looking
windshield. so, windshield wipers today. movement is,
exactly used hypnotic induction. think lot hypnosis EMDR. - Ah. -
think, combination exposure based treatments, use
EMDR think it. tend not process experience much just
physical part it, personally think drawback. And, every study seen
dismantling study. no question people go EMDR, many
get better trauma related problems VA big program using
on. every program dismantled, going treatment

anything it. toward end career, Francine [indistinct]

things. So, tend think that, EMDR another form exposure based therapy
trauma, implied exception possible new data, certainly
doesn't with, rapid eye movement sleep. don't think moving eyes
issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put
weight this, going re-injure ankle example, simply mean
body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat
something coming opportunity something ameliorate situation. So,
not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding
happening. face also say, opportunity
something it. minute realistically enha- doesn't mean,
imagine away heart attack. means figure rehabilitate heart attack


broken leg something like way get much control

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body
floating, safe comfortable. Now, picture Mary sit feeling sadness
no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,
watch it, try [stutters]. work enjoying together shows
breathing patterns may increase sympathetic arousal may decrease. may
[indistinct] cyclic sighing seems to, actually, time spent exhaling

'cause increasing pressure chest therefore allowing heart slow

take deep breath part induction slowly exhale. partly
result research together, emphasizing slow exhale more, part
[stutters], enhance idea induction period relaxation, 'cause

absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go
automatically can control it. so, kind way us demonstrate
ourselves, greater ways modulating internal state. So, can either it,
thinking it, way pain control hypnosis can
extent, taking charge breathing things will produce change
want see happen body. So, like right margin,
can enhance, me, like way augmenting hypnosis,
medication, think powerful way that. - Great, really excited see
goes. - Yes. - Breathing, vision, bodily states clearly the-
directed mental focus, seem key elements hypnosis. missing


ingredients? - Yeah, think right. - It's- - Breathing, vision, - Breathing, vision,
change vision don't, know, typically physically relaxed

classical pianists say, not thinking, start thinking fingers

peak performance, just flowing it. not thinking step step,
doing? best working
giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much
always you. can people learn about, can get

access that. - Reveri app app store, way. reveri.com
website, can get download Reveri app app
store. - Great. So, currently apple, hopefully soon, also Android,
meantime, people interested exploring clinical hypnosis, working
somebody similar? centralized resource people can go find, really
well-trained hypnotists? - two good professional organizations will help
that. One society clinical experimental hypnosis. think

interesting book history national parks says, didn't

those, relaxes upper movement, eyes closed don't

exactly right. - Rubbing tummy patting head. bit

father. So, Spiegel senior Spiegel junior? - Spiegel senior. -
developed Spiegel Eye-Roll Test. - key issue this, normally
close eyes also, going sleep. not worried going
world anymore. Here, maintaining resting alertness. So, focusing
turning inward. unusual state. Normally close eyes periodically,
to, close eyes period time, normally go


sleep not worried detecting risk threat. So, interesting state
turning inward, basically, looking up, shutting eyes
allowing whatever happens outside happen focusing
going inward. So, think signal brain turn inward. - interesting.
meditation course, done eyes open almost always done
eyes closed. - Yes, right. - interesting. So, can quickly determine
whether not someone highly hypnotizable. - Right. - not hypnotizable.
said two thirds people can hypnotized. - Right. - Obviously third cannot.
within two thirds can, range, said 15% people fall
this, highly hypnotizable category. - Right, correct. - seem member
of. - Yeah. - And, repeated use self-hypnosis clinical hypnosis, increase
change hypnotizability, can access first place? - say
general, may increase little bit, not hell lot, not worth effort
increase hypnotizability point. worth trying deal problem,
dealing with. So, can get better using level have.
study done tried train people hypnotizable
obviously, there're subjective behavioral components test, can learn
little better them. found reanalyze data,
account three times final score, based initial hypnotizability
measurement, rather whether not trained better. So,
can improve little

01:15:36 EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)

not worth trouble. - Got it. Along lines eyes eye movements, lot
interest EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. -
Shapiro working, wasn't Stanford directly, local
Stanford. - Yeah. - think Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - thoughts
EMDR? useful, think less useful? things
EMDR combined make useful? listeners podcast
come to, think, come podcast range backgrounds interests. me,
makes sense EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given newer
data can suppress amygdala activity animals animal models
humans well. really hasn't explored much, neurally. heard things like,


coordinates two sides brain, it, just throwaway. don't think
evidence that, coordinating two sides brain better not
coordinating. wouldn't speaking right now two sides brain, well
correlated. - Yeah. - language lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - heard
mimics, rapid eye movements sleep, actually doesn't. So, - Right. -
heard people talk positive experiences EMDR.
thoughts EMDR? - Yeah, good comment one recent
podcasts. tell you, one way sort think bemused point view,
old, mentioned earlier, oldest sort idea hypnotic induction,
dangling watch, right? [indistinct] watch. And, fact, enough concern
automobiles invented, movement prevent
installing windshield wipers people afraid hypnotized,
watched windshield wipers go back forth car. Now, turns
fortunately that, tend not look windshield wipers. keep looking
windshield. so, windshield wipers today. movement is,
exactly used hypnotic induction. think lot hypnosis EMDR. - Ah. -
think, combination exposure based treatments, use
EMDR think it. tend not process experience much just
physical part it, personally think drawback. And, every study seen
dismantling study. no question people go EMDR, many
get better trauma related problems VA big program using
on. every program dismantled, going treatment
lateral eye movement, shown lateral eye movement, doesn't add
anything it. toward end career, Francine [indistinct]

things. So, tend think that, EMDR another form exposure based therapy
trauma, implied exception possible new data, certainly
doesn't with, rapid eye movement sleep. don't think moving eyes
issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put
weight this, going re-injure ankle example, simply mean
body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat
something coming opportunity something ameliorate situation. So,
not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding
happening. face also say, opportunity
something it. minute realistically enha- doesn't mean,
imagine away heart attack. means figure rehabilitate heart attack


broken leg something like way get much control

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body
floating, safe comfortable. Now, picture Mary sit feeling sadness
no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,
watch it, try [stutters]. work enjoying together shows
breathing patterns may increase sympathetic arousal may decrease. may
[indistinct] cyclic sighing seems to, actually, time spent exhaling
inhaling. reason believe induces parasympathetic activity,
'cause increasing pressure chest therefore allowing heart slow
blood returned atrium easily. use it. ask people
take deep breath part induction slowly exhale. partly
result research together, emphasizing slow exhale more, part
[stutters], enhance idea induction period relaxation, 'cause
think inducing perhaps perceiving well. So, no,
absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go
automatically can control it. so, kind way us demonstrate
ourselves, greater ways modulating internal state. So, can either it,
thinking it, way pain control hypnosis can
extent, taking charge breathing things will produce change
want see happen body. So, like right margin,
can enhance, me, like way augmenting hypnosis,
medication, think powerful way that. - Great, really excited see
goes. - Yes. - Breathing, vision, bodily states clearly the-
directed mental focus, seem key elements hypnosis. missing


ingredients? - Yeah, think right. - It's- - Breathing, vision, - Breathing, vision,
change vision don't, know, typically physically relaxed
state, frankly people peak performance, including physical athletic
performance musical performance hypnotic states too. talked
classical pianists say, not thinking, start thinking fingers
now, screw up. floating piano, thinking tone want
feel exuding instrument. hypnotic like state too. many athletes
peak performance, just flowing it. not thinking step step,
doing? best working
giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much
always you. can people learn about, can get
hypnotized? mentioned Reveri, put link it, R-E-V-E-R-I.com way
access that. - Reveri app app store, way. reveri.com
website, can get download Reveri app app
store. - Great. So, currently apple, hopefully soon, also Android,
meantime, people interested exploring clinical hypnosis, working
somebody similar? centralized resource people can go find, really
well-trained hypnotists? - two good professional organizations will help
that. One society clinical experimental hypnosis. think
sceh.us their- - Okay, look provide link. - American society
clinical hypnosis, provide referral services professionals. can look
up. just say general, look someone licensed trained
primary professional discipline, psychiatry, psychology, medicine, dentistry
training interest using hypnosis, way it. - Great one
question comment. question is, will psychiatrist? - [laughs]
honored. - tall task. might stubborn patient. - think hardest
work's already done, Andrew. - Thank you. - fine, now. - appreciate that.
[David laughing] Well, final thing comment. First all, thank much

issue. think way sitting confronting trauma. rather,
trauma processed bit often happens EMDR. So, lot
people gotten therapy. helped. Francine used
originally claim just one session desensitize people it.
clearly not true. see lot people said, yeah, helped need
more. So, think became kind a, overly simplistic approach understanding brain


physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put
weight this, going re-injure ankle example, simply mean
body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat
something coming opportunity something ameliorate situation. So,
not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding
happening. face also say, opportunity
something it. minute realistically enha- doesn't mean,
imagine away heart attack. means figure rehabilitate heart attack


broken leg something like way get much control

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body
floating, safe comfortable. Now, picture Mary sit feeling sadness
no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,
watch it, try [stutters]. work enjoying together shows
breathing patterns may increase sympathetic arousal may decrease. may
[indistinct] cyclic sighing seems to, actually, time spent exhaling
inhaling. reason believe induces parasympathetic activity,
'cause increasing pressure chest therefore allowing heart slow
blood returned atrium easily. use it. ask people
take deep breath part induction slowly exhale. partly
result research together, emphasizing slow exhale more, part
[stutters], enhance idea induction period relaxation, 'cause
think inducing perhaps perceiving well. So, no,
absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go
automatically can control it. so, kind way us demonstrate
ourselves, greater ways modulating internal state. So, can either it,
thinking it, way pain control hypnosis can
extent, taking charge breathing things will produce change
want see happen body. So, like right margin,
can enhance, me, like way augmenting hypnosis,
medication, think powerful way that. - Great, really excited see
goes. - Yes. - Breathing, vision, bodily states clearly the-
directed mental focus, seem key elements hypnosis. missing


ingredients? - Yeah, think right. - It's- - Breathing, vision, - Breathing, vision,
change vision don't, know, typically physically relaxed
state, frankly people peak performance, including physical athletic
performance musical performance hypnotic states too. talked
classical pianists say, not thinking, start thinking fingers
now, screw up. floating piano, thinking tone want
feel exuding instrument. hypnotic like state too. many athletes
peak performance, just flowing it. not thinking step step,
doing? best working
giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much
always you. can people learn about, can get
hypnotized? mentioned Reveri, put link it, R-E-V-E-R-I.com way
access that. - Reveri app app store, way. reveri.com
website, can get download Reveri app app
store. - Great. So, currently apple, hopefully soon, also Android,
meantime, people interested exploring clinical hypnosis, working
somebody similar? centralized resource people can go find, really
well-trained hypnotists? - two good professional organizations will help
that. One society clinical experimental hypnosis. think
sceh.us their- - Okay, look provide link. - American society
clinical hypnosis, provide referral services professionals. can look
up. just say general, look someone licensed trained
primary professional discipline, psychiatry, psychology, medicine, dentistry
training interest using hypnosis, way it. - Great one
question comment. question is, will psychiatrist? - [laughs]

work's already done, Andrew. - Thank you. - fine, now. - appreciate that.
[David laughing] Well, final thing comment. First all, thank much
today, sharing knowledge. - welcome. - hope can
again. - hope so. - love working laboratory you. -
Likewise [indistinct]. - speak, learn know others well. -
Thank you. - will put resources get also just want say, thank


work do. - Well, thank you. - incredible thing world

mysterious people struggling lot things, also think people
really excited about, applying tools like hypnosis perform better, feel better mentally
physically. pointed us tremendous amount resources
tools work already demonstrated work. just, thank
you. know professional commitment life benefit. So, thank
so. - Well, thank you, real joy collaborating
using precision knowledge neuroanatomy, neurobiology

neurobiological end, aren't interested are. so, really pleasure
try bring together know different perspectives build
something neither us alone. so, real joy it. -

nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,
watch it, try [stutters]. work enjoying together shows
breathing patterns may increase sympathetic arousal may decrease. may
[indistinct] cyclic sighing seems to, actually, time spent exhaling
inhaling. reason believe induces parasympathetic activity,
'cause increasing pressure chest therefore allowing heart slow
blood returned atrium easily. use it. ask people
take deep breath part induction slowly exhale. partly
result research together, emphasizing slow exhale more, part
[stutters], enhance idea induction period relaxation, 'cause
think inducing perhaps perceiving well. So, no,
absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go
automatically can control it. so, kind way us demonstrate
ourselves, greater ways modulating internal state. So, can either it,
thinking it, way pain control hypnosis can
extent, taking charge breathing things will produce change
want see happen body. So, like right margin,
can enhance, me, like way augmenting hypnosis,
medication, think powerful way that. - Great, really excited see
goes. - Yes. - Breathing, vision, bodily states clearly the-
directed mental focus, seem key elements hypnosis. missing


ingredients? - Yeah, think right. - It's- - Breathing, vision, - Breathing, vision,
change vision don't, know, typically physically relaxed
state, frankly people peak performance, including physical athletic
performance musical performance hypnotic states too. talked
classical pianists say, not thinking, start thinking fingers
now, screw up. floating piano, thinking tone want
feel exuding instrument. hypnotic like state too. many athletes
peak performance, just flowing it. not thinking step step,
doing? best working
giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much
always you. can people learn about, can get
hypnotized? mentioned Reveri, put link it, R-E-V-E-R-I.com way
access that. - Reveri app app store, way. reveri.com
website, can get download Reveri app app

meantime, people interested exploring clinical hypnosis, working
somebody similar? centralized resource people can go find, really
well-trained hypnotists? - two good professional organizations will help
that. One society clinical experimental hypnosis. think

physiology part wrong. interesting thing, mentioned suppressing
amygdala activity. interesting that, late friend Allen Hobson,
brilliant sleep researcher, know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, don't know him,
read book college chemistry sleep. - Right.
similarities dream states hallucinations. - Yes. - one reasons
got business. - Yes, well, worked MacArthur mind-body network
many years. - Wow. - brilliant guy, points need get into,
primarily parasympathetic state go sleep, shut off sympathetic
nervous system. loud noise wakes up, heart rate goes
this. So, brilliant documenting happens brain sleep.
pointed something also interesting dreams, stories
dreams, even images dreams can change place crazy ways.
usually affect constant, said, usually frustration dream, whatever
happens, end frustrated. enjoyment dream, enjoy whatever's
going on. So, odd consistency affect dreams don't
states. idea lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity
kind fit that, don't allow intrusions fear anger upset dreams.
may time, may not think be. So,
can falling off building somehow not scared, just
experience flying dream. So, think may something going
regulating affect, are, elaborated better ways regulate affect. -
Great, EMDR, might incorporate elements hypnosis, lateralized eye
movements, perhaps way suppressing amygdala, fear associated center,
might bring people parasympathetic calm state. So, might pseudo
hypnosis, exposure therapy discussion issue. - Right.
- Okay. research needed EMDR there.

01:21:43 Confronting Stress & Trauma

obviously, something come lot discussion discussions
that, great fortune talking every week is, working together is,
idea getting close phobia, getting close trauma, re-experiencing
portal adjusting response rewiring something. So, troubling thing
horrible thing no longer horrible us. repeating theme can't


expect get something without getting really close it. Maybe even experiencing
somatically. Nowadays, hear lot about, triggers trigger warnings.
certainly, one can understand exist, seems like general
population, idea want move away anything upsets us
yet, - Right. - think fair say, even though haven't gathered statistics that,
whole, human beings becoming anxious
stressed, perhaps certainly parallel, fact trying
move away troubling things. So, heard say before, terms
therapeutic approaches, not just state get into, whether not
brought voluntarily. - exactly right. - So, element deliberate
self exposure, deciding going confront trauma, going confront pain.
going confront insomnia. going confront the, know, fill
blank. readjusting one's emotional response, right next troubling
thing. seems hallmark treatment. And, thinking
correctly, pretty much treatments getting stuff. people don't access
really good clinician, like yourself, carry thoughts
ideas? mean, think almost everybody reasonable age, memories things
upset them, learn suppress them. one do? Obviously,
Reveri app approaches dealing this, inside app,
one start think about, actually dealing something like avoiding
hazards just kind reactivating lot painful experiences? lot
functional human also going work day, interacting people not
bringing one's trauma, dumping table able just function
crucial. So, think clinician? - Well, image comes
mind Greek myth Pandora's Box. opened Furies got
couldn't put 'em back in. kind fantasy get
memories, take never get back box. think
wrong. People use hypnosis say that, ways present things
people will helpful ways won't. one real mistake tell someone,
don't think purple elephants. thinking about? - Purple elephants. -
doesn't work. So, want find way feel control access define
happened terms. so, not big fan trigger warnings. think
going crazy over, upsetting, upsetting. Yeah,
lots things upsetting. average kid watched 20,000 murders,


time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put
weight this, going re-injure ankle example, simply mean
body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat
something coming opportunity something ameliorate situation. So,
not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding
happening. face also say, opportunity
something it. minute realistically enha- doesn't mean,
imagine away heart attack. means figure rehabilitate heart attack


broken leg something like way get much control

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body
floating, safe comfortable. Now, picture Mary sit feeling sadness
no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,
watch it, try [stutters]. work enjoying together shows
breathing patterns may increase sympathetic arousal may decrease. may
[indistinct] cyclic sighing seems to, actually, time spent exhaling
inhaling. reason believe induces parasympathetic activity,
'cause increasing pressure chest therefore allowing heart slow
blood returned atrium easily. use it. ask people
take deep breath part induction slowly exhale. partly
result research together, emphasizing slow exhale more, part
[stutters], enhance idea induction period relaxation, 'cause
think inducing perhaps perceiving well. So, no,
absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go
automatically can control it. so, kind way us demonstrate
ourselves, greater ways modulating internal state. So, can either it,
thinking it, way pain control hypnosis can
extent, taking charge breathing things will produce change
want see happen body. So, like right margin,
can enhance, me, like way augmenting hypnosis,
medication, think powerful way that. - Great, really excited see
goes. - Yes. - Breathing, vision, bodily states clearly the-
directed mental focus, seem key elements hypnosis. missing


ingredients? - Yeah, think right. - It's- - Breathing, vision, - Breathing, vision,
change vision don't, know, typically physically relaxed
state, frankly people peak performance, including physical athletic
performance musical performance hypnotic states too. talked
classical pianists say, not thinking, start thinking fingers
now, screw up. floating piano, thinking tone want
feel exuding instrument. hypnotic like state too. many athletes
peak performance, just flowing it. not thinking step step,
doing? best working
giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much
always you. can people learn about, can get
hypnotized? mentioned Reveri, put link it, R-E-V-E-R-I.com way
access that. - Reveri app app store, way. reveri.com
website, can get download Reveri app app

meantime, people interested exploring clinical hypnosis, working
somebody similar? centralized resource people can go find, really
well-trained hypnotists? - two good professional organizations will help
that. One society clinical experimental hypnosis. think
sceh.us their- - Okay, look provide link. - American society
clinical hypnosis, provide referral services professionals. can look
up. just say general, look someone licensed trained
primary professional discipline, psychiatry, psychology, medicine, dentistry
training interest using hypnosis, way it. - Great one
question comment. question is, will psychiatrist? - [laughs]
honored. - tall task. might stubborn patient. - think hardest
work's already done, Andrew. - Thank you. - fine, now. - appreciate that.
[David laughing] Well, final thing comment. First all, thank much
today, sharing knowledge. - welcome. - hope can

Likewise [indistinct]. - speak, learn know others well. -
Thank you. - will put resources get also just want say, thank

mysterious people struggling lot things, also think people
really excited about, applying tools like hypnosis perform better, feel better mentally
physically. pointed us tremendous amount resources

you. know professional commitment life benefit. So, thank
so. - Well, thank you, real joy collaborating

time 20 years old, watching television movies days. So, see terrible
things not matter of, exposed something upsetting,
handle it? make feeling control? not like,
Putin rival Russia, forcing watch propaganda movies 10 hours
day, prison. matter thinking problem, way leaves
feeling, understand better. control, can turn off
want, can turn want. to, life, deal stressful
things, studies, Karen Parker Stanford done wonderful studies
primates stress inoculation. separate baby monkey
mother two hours day reunite them, stress baby
monkey later, actually handle stress better. less cortisol arousal face
distress, stress inoculation, called. So, mere exposure trauma stress.
part living anyway. can't avoid it, even like to, and, not pleasant,
not great sometimes things need learn life. can find
algorithm facing it, putting perspective, dealing it, become stronger
person not weaker person. So, idea that, college students fragile flowers,
talk sexual assault something, something terrible
them, just wrong. think need build ability recognize manage
stress. can't without it. can't ride bicycle without taking
risk falling off it. so, think way, think dealing stress. - Yeah,
really appreciate saying that. gathering, say
issue discussed, around issue publicized sexual trauma.
made excellent case stuff can't pushed rug.
actually, observation, led lot healing people families
people suffered this. think people resilient. don't really teach
think feelings. told need feel feelings, again,
also told feelings don't hold information. so, think
mentioned, no operating users manual nervous system thing.

01:27:56 Mind-Body Connection

Brings another issue, mind-body connection. Something
interested done extensive work on. like think that, getting
touch body, great thing, learning interocept, paying


attention internal landscape, great thing. often discuss,
feeling lousy, really touch lousy feeling, may may
not good thing, right? So, think mind-body? can see
examples hypnosis, descriptions hypnosis, want unify
mind-body connection. Feel thinking, think feeling, et cetera.
also point elements within hypnotic process actively trying
uncouple those. - That's. - So, sounds like, whole mind-body thing bit
like car. can't say 40 miles per hour optimal speed. kind
depends road turn may may not taking. - Right. -
think mind-body terms of, navigating daily life? think
adaptive way, conceptualize mind-body? big question. - is.
interesting one. guess, think matter not of, absolute control
control, need think brain tool body's signals tools
well, help us understand going world, need, matters,
important, isn't, also something can managed, not simply
absorbed. so, hypnosis think kind limiting case, can push
far can push terms regulating pain. Pain good example that.
Obviously, need pay attention. just broke ankle, better pay
attention get help crushing substernal chest pain. better
something it. brain, sort programmed treat pain signals
novel pain signals. sudden new problem needs attended to.
teach people think pain categorize it, pain mean put
weight this, going re-injure ankle example, simply mean
body healing pain sign that, gradually things getting back
normal so, can modify way process pain, based brain tells
pain means. true emotional pain well. particularly
think strategy really helps, think interpersonal problem threat
something coming opportunity something ameliorate situation. So,
not just happening you, something can influence something
about. So, blending receptive active response, think can make
difference. So, try process way gives deeper understanding
happening. face also say, opportunity
something it. minute realistically enha- doesn't mean,
imagine away heart attack. means figure rehabilitate heart attack


broken leg something like way get much control

01:31:35 Dealing Grief

situation can. - love it. Grief. Grief one states
hard remove oneself from. lot people asked me, deal grief?
not clinician deferring you. - Mm-hm. - one hand, actually
someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body
floating, safe comfortable. Now, picture Mary sit feeling sadness
no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,
watch it, try [stutters]. work enjoying together shows
breathing patterns may increase sympathetic arousal may decrease. may
[indistinct] cyclic sighing seems to, actually, time spent exhaling
inhaling. reason believe induces parasympathetic activity,
'cause increasing pressure chest therefore allowing heart slow
blood returned atrium easily. use it. ask people
take deep breath part induction slowly exhale. partly
result research together, emphasizing slow exhale more, part
[stutters], enhance idea induction period relaxation, 'cause
think inducing perhaps perceiving well. So, no,
absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go
automatically can control it. so, kind way us demonstrate
ourselves, greater ways modulating internal state. So, can either it,
thinking it, way pain control hypnosis can
extent, taking charge breathing things will produce change
want see happen body. So, like right margin,
can enhance, me, like way augmenting hypnosis,
medication, think powerful way that. - Great, really excited see
goes. - Yes. - Breathing, vision, bodily states clearly the-
directed mental focus, seem key elements hypnosis. missing


ingredients? - Yeah, think right. - It's- - Breathing, vision, - Breathing, vision,
change vision don't, know, typically physically relaxed
state, frankly people peak performance, including physical athletic
performance musical performance hypnotic states too. talked
classical pianists say, not thinking, start thinking fingers
now, screw up. floating piano, thinking tone want
feel exuding instrument. hypnotic like state too. many athletes
peak performance, just flowing it. not thinking step step,
doing? best working
giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much
always you. can people learn about, can get
hypnotized? mentioned Reveri, put link it, R-E-V-E-R-I.com way
access that. - Reveri app app store, way. reveri.com
website, can get download Reveri app app
store. - Great. So, currently apple, hopefully soon, also Android,
meantime, people interested exploring clinical hypnosis, working
somebody similar? centralized resource people can go find, really
well-trained hypnotists? - two good professional organizations will help
that. One society clinical experimental hypnosis. think
sceh.us their- - Okay, look provide link. - American society
clinical hypnosis, provide referral services professionals. can look
up. just say general, look someone licensed trained
primary professional discipline, psychiatry, psychology, medicine, dentistry
training interest using hypnosis, way it. - Great one
question comment. question is, will psychiatrist? - [laughs]
honored. - tall task. might stubborn patient. - think hardest
work's already done, Andrew. - Thank you. - fine, now. - appreciate that.
[David laughing] Well, final thing comment. First all, thank much
today, sharing knowledge. - welcome. - hope can
again. - hope so. - love working laboratory you. -
Likewise [indistinct]. - speak, learn know others well. -
Thank you. - will put resources get also just want say, thank


work do. - Well, thank you. - incredible thing world

mysterious people struggling lot things, also think people
really excited about, applying tools like hypnosis perform better, feel better mentally
physically. pointed us tremendous amount resources
tools work already demonstrated work. just, thank
you. know professional commitment life benefit. So, thank
so. - Well, thank you, real joy collaborating

someone Stanford recently came said, mother passed away
sibling passed away people had. also living
alone challenged number things. And, looked like
holding together, - Mm-hm. - well, fact, given describing.
one hand, well, certainly pointed not clinician, said one
hand, imagine necessary useful go grief's state,
want transition it. - Right. - hand there, heard
cathartic model just really diving emotion, can also potentially
hazardous. don't anchors grab onto. view psychiatry
view grief deal grief? think grief is, one
encompassing emotions many people. - Yeah, is. important, natural,
necessary stage life. reason grief rituals burials
memorials headstones sitting shiva things people do. way
making real, incomprehensible loss comprehended.
realize now going live life without loved one, parent,
sibling, whoever. gone one time another, certainly have.
hard just come terms with, one principle sort say, never
none, less. yes, none lost loved one, ask
people part grieving say themselves, hypnosis sometimes
too. lost left with? bequeathed
even though gone? sometimes ask say, mother
right now, say you? feel life now?
advise do? So, support groups women advanced
breast cancer, lost people. got tell warned oncologists,
demoralized people that, mean, wonderful oncologists,
afraid harm way, mortality
rate fairly high metastatic breast cancer. going watch people die


disease demoralize them. So, actually measured emotion
content speech every five minutes throughout bunch groups make sure
wasn't happening. found was, talked serious issues,
mood didn't actually get worse. found general expressing negative
emotion long run helps people less anxious depressed time.
shown randomized clinical trials. So, not just clinical impression.
try get do, face loss, live emotion comes
also see reason hurts much, much person gave you. So,
self-hypnosis exercise [indistinct] say, want get body

no longer us. minutes. say
side, picture one thing left still have, carry
heart, tradition gave you. just seeing it, not complete loss,
real loss, painful loss one helps reflect on, gained
knowing her, think can helpful grieving process.

01:35:45 Hypnosis Children & Groups

- helpful way conceptualize it. Couple quick questions. Can children
safely hypnotized self-hypnosis? - sometimes harder self-
hypnosis, need structure it. got share dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex 'em little bit, yes, absolutely, children can
hypnotizable. know pediatricians, use wonderfully time. get
focus something else. So, going give shot draw
blood something. say, going press happy button
presses belly button. start giggle way kids do. meanwhile,
nurse drawing blood don't even notice it. Dentists, good dentists can use
help kids fear pain. yes, can effective children.
randomized trial. publication pediatrics, late sister,
pediatrician, always used joke that, one family
real doctor. said, gotcha. got paper pediatrics [Andrew laughing]
paper children undergo, voiding cystourethrogram. So, anatomy
kidney, forgive me, sort interesting that, ureter goes
bladder, normally goes bladder angle. means,


bladder contracts expel urine, automatically closes off ureter
sideways bladder. kids born perpendicular, get
reflux kidney. children outgrow it, need pretty complicated
surgery fix that. so, image every year see whether
getting kidney damage not. pretty miserable experience. nine year
old girl. go lie hard cold table, strangers pull legs apart
stick catheter urethra hold bladder expel urine.
so, get struggling fights. course struggle,
constrict makes harder it. So, asked test this. So,
randomized trial children's hospital. either got training self-hypnosis.
meet mother week before, find kids
like be. say, going play trick doctors. body's
there, somewhere else, go visit friend, go Disneyland, something else.
mother work head table. found
children much easier image. One got relaxed that, guy
[indistinct] said, normally takes us 10 minutes get pee
this. relaxed, started peeing even get bed pan
[laughs]. clean table. also, 17 minutes shorter
procedures. long 17 minutes little kid. So, can effective
children. less anxious, less pain get difficult
procedures well. - great. hypnosis ever done couples, like
couples therapy? thinking pretty much every clinical setting here. people
hypnotizable, course. - Mm-hm, yes. - reason ask this,
next, going ask psychedelics lot interest in, coordinating
states use, drugs different kinds. - Mm-hm. - actually
treat depression, right? depressed person family members
not depressed, say, well, make not depressed [chuckles], [David
laughing] right, mean, half kidding there, kind
underlying logic sense. aware coordinated hypnosis? -
interesting, mean, done plenty groups not couples. - can
hypnotize large groups, once? - Oh yeah. - hypnotized right now? - Yeah,
are. hope enjoying it. [Andrew laughing] metastatic breast
cancer, group like 10 women, meet week
go hypnosis together. - didn't realize that, hypnotizing


collectively. - Yes, right. - Fascinating. - that, anything, think brings best
people's abilities shared social experience talk
afterwards.

01:40:06 Drug Therapies & Hypnosis

so, yes, absolutely doable, yeah. - don't want focus psychedelics
specifically. Maybe topic future episode. basis
combining hypnosis drug therapies inside hypnotic episode? So, realize
patients yours, might prescribed antidepressant medication
purpose, maybe different hypnosis directed toward.
evidence that, people relaxed use propranolol one
many things psychiatrist's kit, hypnosis can effective? - Well,
interestingly, one study haven't mentioned is, spectroscopy people
hypnotized. found that, correlation hypnotizability
GABA activity anterior cingulate cortex, fits turning activity.
extent can self-medicate GABA receptors basically
benzodiazepines brain, can happen people hypnotized. -
saying inside hypnosis, neural evidence that, kind
sedative effect hypnosis chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - people
hypnotizable, GABA receptives related
degree hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - terms of, studies,
give people medications well. interesting thing
benzodiazepines, activate inhibitory activity brain. anxious,
might improve hypnotic response bit. just anxious [indistinct]
can't it. not anxious, actually inhibits hypnotic activity get
sort sedated just it. can't focus attention, well. So,
large, don't use drugs adjuvant hypnotic experience. time
don't need to. sometimes can make worse rather better.
evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, little reliably,
much, Well, [indistinct] scatter attention less control it. So,
might adjuvants, frankly think hypnosis replacement
need supplementation. - laboratory laboratory have, well, sort
snuck lab



01:42:39 Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance

trying emerge two, lot fun, - sure has, learning lot
about, power respiration breathing shift brain states, not just breathing
protocols, times. will entire episode protocols. think
we, - Cool. - published on. breathing is, described
bridge conscious unconscious states. - Right. - So, ask,
important patient's breathing pattern? closely monitoring
breathing pattern? closely monitor breathing pattern
inducing hypnosis? Put simply, role respiration shifting brain's state,
hypnotic protocol? - Yeah, interesting. great show
Jack- - Yeah, Jack Feldman - Feldman. [Andrew indistinct] is. issue,
watch it, try [stutters]. work enjoying together shows
breathing patterns may increase sympathetic arousal may decrease. may
[indistinct] cyclic sighing seems to, actually, time spent exhaling
inhaling. reason believe induces parasympathetic activity,
'cause increasing pressure chest therefore allowing heart slow
blood returned atrium easily. use it. ask people
take deep breath part induction slowly exhale. partly
result research together, emphasizing slow exhale more, part
[stutters], enhance idea induction period relaxation, 'cause
think inducing perhaps perceiving well. So, no,
absolutely right breathing interesting 'cause right edge conscious
Jack talked too, conscious unconscious control, will go
automatically can control it. so, kind way us demonstrate
ourselves, greater ways modulating internal state. So, can either it,
thinking it, way pain control hypnosis can
extent, taking charge breathing things will produce change
want see happen body. So, like right margin,
can enhance, me, like way augmenting hypnosis,
medication, think powerful way that. - Great, really excited see
goes. - Yes. - Breathing, vision, bodily states clearly the-
directed mental focus, seem key elements hypnosis. missing


ingredients? - Yeah, think right. - It's- - Breathing, vision, - Breathing, vision,
change vision don't, know, typically physically relaxed
state, frankly people peak performance, including physical athletic
performance musical performance hypnotic states too. talked
classical pianists say, not thinking, start thinking fingers
now, screw up. floating piano, thinking tone want
feel exuding instrument. hypnotic like state too. many athletes
peak performance, just flowing it. not thinking step step,
doing? best working
giving talk well, hypnotic like states. So, usually requires,
doesn't necessarily require physical comfort quietness. can sometimes intense
activity. - Incredible. Well, amazing discussion. learned much
always you. can people learn about, can get
hypnotized? mentioned Reveri, put link it, R-E-V-E-R-I.com way
access that. - Reveri app app store, way. reveri.com
website, can get download Reveri app app

meantime, people interested exploring clinical hypnosis, working
somebody similar? centralized resource people can go find, really
well-trained hypnotists? - two good professional organizations will help
that. One society clinical experimental hypnosis. think
sceh.us their- - Okay, look provide link. - American society

up. just say general, look someone licensed trained
primary professional discipline, psychiatry, psychology, medicine, dentistry
training interest using hypnosis, way it. - Great one
question comment. question is, will psychiatrist? - [laughs]
