00:04:41 Emotions: Logical Framework Brain-Body Loops

again, patreon.com/AndrewHuberman like support podcast
way. Today's episode going science emotions. first month
podcast, talked sleep wakefulness. Last month, talking
neuroplasticity, brain's ability change response experience. month
going talk things call emotions. going decipher
are, work, can control might not want
control them. going four episodes emotions. today, going
talk particular something often called stress. Now, might
thinking, "Wait, stress isn't emotion." stress really lies heart whether
not internal experience matched well not external experience
events happening us around us. soon, see converge
combine create call emotions. Now, want clear
going talk biology emotions, going talk little bit
psychological concepts related emotion, definitely going talk tools
control call stress commonly think stress. also going clean
common myths stress. instance, stress impairs immune
system. true certain contexts. contexts, stress actually enhances
immune system makes function better. going lot
discussion whether not internal state, whether not alert calm
good bad, depending circumstances. So, headed like
come away today's episode call organizational logic,
framework thinking things typically just call happy sad
depressed anxious. going make sure tools grounded
physiology neuroscience will allow navigate otherwise complex
space call emotions will allow ground better
feeling like life weighing you, kind pulled currents
life well support people whether not psychological practice
practitioner, clients children spouses, really, able


support people environment better. tools going focus
today range behavioral tools. will talk valuable
supplementation tools there. going talk little bit things
like depression, PTSD, will devoting entire episodes things like depression,
PTSD, even attention deficit obsessive compulsive disorder, believe
not, although might not surprise many you, strong emotional
component. just not just compulsive behaviors intrusive thoughts. also
emotional load state. So, promise today going
clean lot misunderstanding. going give lot tools
going learn lot biology body brain work together.
ever topic brought together brain body mind-body
relationship, stress emotions. also positive emotions. feel
something, whether not super happy just feeling kind pleasant
feeling stressed, anxious, overwhelmed, isn't just head. also body.
may recall, nervous system, includes brain eyes
spinal cord, also connections organs body includes
brain body. organs body, gut, liver, spleen,
also communicating brain. So, look forward day, fact,
no longer think neuroscience just brain. many neuroscientists now also
think body, course. brain controls body, body also
profound concrete influence brain. think recently,
people hear kind brain-body always think mindfulness.
actually not going talk much mindfulness today. Mindfulness kind
vague concept, fact. think mindfulness, good take
opposite. opposite mindfulness? mindlessness. Well,
sudden territory isn't really easy one person describe
experience help others experience. Today, going talk
objective tools match brain-body experience separate brain-body
experience ways leverage ability lean life better, feel better, literally
just feel better experiencing, believe not, able
control emotions appropriate. isn't becoming robotic.
isn't trying not feel human. actually able lean life
better consequence able control inner real estate.
nervous system includes brain body nervous system


interacting outside world. So, place greater position power.
so, get started deciphering stress, emotions, batch
stress emotions one discussion today?

00:10:29 Stress: (Falsely Narrow) Animal Attack Narrative

Okay. So, stress? hear time stress bad. hear people saying
really stressed out. stress? presumably heard arguments
framework stress horrible ancient carryover times
humans pursued animals human predators whenever feel
call stress feel stressed out, just unfortunate invasion
something no longer need modern life, designed
attacked bears tigers lions whatever is. gosh,
unfortunate thing. many creature comforts nowadays, not
eliminated stress. Almost like organ system body
bad us, stuck just species are. first all,
species experience stress. think fair say even though wasn't there,
yes, fact, throughout evolutionary history, vulnerable animal attack
human attacks regular basis point started developing
weapons structures fire things allow us protect
better animals invaders various kinds. entirely naive us
think ancient times, ancient times kind loose term previous
medieval times, 100 years ago, 1000 years ago, 10,000 years ago, course,
infidelities, right? Partners cheated. People died. fact, advent phones,
going talk today, can imagine someone might head off
hunt go visit relative never come back never know why.
stressful. So, psychosocial stress. stress
losing loved ones. stress cold, famine. stress
probably also just worry. idea ancient versions humans 1000 years ago,
100 years ago didn't worry, think entirely inconsistent everything know
structure human brain 100 years, 1000 years ago. So, problems
struggling existed forever. just stress core generalized
system. wasn't designed tigers attacking us people attacking us. system
mobilize systems brain body. stress really is. designed


generic. important thing like understand today,
system governs call stress generic. wasn't designed one
thing. gives certain advantage taking state brain body,
also gives you, us advantage controlling based hard-
wired biological mechanisms hard-wired biological mechanisms, meaning
cells chemicals pathways tissues exist right now require no
neuroplasticity allow put brake stress. so, going talk
those. So, system stress system distress
baked you. genetically encoded. born
still now. So, alive listening, capacity control
stress. today, going talk ways can control stress, not
just offline practice meditation breath work something like that,
real-time tools. Tools allow push back stress stress hits real
time. something lab works actively developing testing
tools

00:14:31 Stress RESPONSE: Generic, Channels blood, Biases Action

evolving tools. laboratories well. So,
talk stress response. that, will understand exactly
tools going give work. saying, "Wait, just want
tools. Just give summary," trust me, understand mechanism, going
far better position incorporate tools, teach tools others,
modify life circumstances change. like cheat sheet
just want one-page PDF, eventually get stuff people, really
important understand underlying mechanism. Okay. So, stress? Well,
just distinguish stressors, things stress us out, stress,
psychological physiological response stressors. mainly going
talk stress, response things. clear already
know, stressors can psychological can physical. Okay?
put outside cold day without jacket long time, stressful.
prepare many exams can't balance
sleep schedule needs comfort wellbeing, like food, rest, sleep,
social connection, stressful. So, stress, mentioned before, generic.


doesn't distinguish physical emotional stress. So, happens
stress response hits? talk immediate call acute stress
response. also think short-term stress. So, collection
neurons. name. called sympathetic chain ganglia. nothing
sympathy. Sympa means together. group neurons start
right neck run navel, little bit lower,
called sympathetic chain ganglia. don't need memorize name.
will not quiz. important know middle body,
chain neurons something stresses us out, either mind
something enters environment see something stresses us out,
don't like heights afraid heights, somebody dislike walks room, et
cetera, chain neurons becomes activated like bunch dominoes falling
once. fast. happens, neurons release neuromodulator
neurochemical talked podcast called acetylcholine.
release various sites within body. Now, important normally,
acetylcholine used move muscles. Actually, every time move muscle,
pick cup coffee, write pen, walk street, spinal neurons
connecting muscle releasing acetylcholine. So, brain involved focus
muscles involved making muscles twitch. stressed,
wouldn't want muscles contract just kind like
paralyzed like tonic activation, called. wouldn't want that.
Something called tetanus, believe not. tetanus toxin will cause kind
rigor entire body. not want that. neurons activated,
acetylcholine released, neurons aficionados there.
called postganglionic neurons. ones respond acetylcholine
release epinephrine, equivalent adrenaline. So,
system fast whenever stressed, core body,
neurons middle body release chemicals
adrenaline epinephrine released particular organs acts particular ways.
going weeds here. just stay going make
lot sense will appreciate knowledge hand. epinephrine
acts two different ways. things like muscles legs heart
things need active stressed, certain kind
receptor called beta receptor. beta receptor responds


epinephrine blood vessels dilate. get bigger blood rushes legs.
heart rate speeds up. Lots things happen get activated.
time, epinephrine activates receptors certain tissues don't need.
ones involved digestion, reproduction, things sort luxuries
things going well, not things pay attention stressed.
binds receptors contract blood vessels. So, basically stress
response, key phrase here, stress response A, generic, said
before, B, basically pushes certain systems activated systems
not activated. So, stress response two-pronged. yes certain things
no, may not right now things. So, key thing understand
stress response. heart speeds up. feel blood
certain organs tissues body, not others. throat goes
dry turns get stressed, salivary glands shut down.
lot less blood flow neurons control salivation. so, going
start swallowing. feel like throat getting dry. lot different
effects. not going list off, basically, activated ways
support moving. So, third thing. first all, generic. Second all,
stress response, activate certain things shuts features body.
sense agitation makes want move.
fundamentally, stress response just generic thing says something.
movement case can either bias move terms action, can
bias say something. stressed, likely say something
probably shouldn't say. likely move. trying suppress
movement, feel tremor. going feel agitated
designed move you. So, important want control stress,
need learn work agitation.

00:21:08 Tools Actually Control Stress: Reduce Alertness Increase Calm

like give tool point, think go lot
science, people going begin wonder just going kind standard
university lecture stress response. going give signs
stress response, want take now already know stress response
use framework thinking one might reduce even eliminate


stress response quickly real time, arise don't want it. So,
taking podium sitting Zoom call, sudden feeling
flushed. feeling like heart racing. feeling little alert. feeling
little worked want calm down. far aware of, best tools
reduce stress quickly, so-called real-time tools going tools direct
line so-called autonomic nervous system. autonomic nervous system
name given kind general features alertness calmness body.
Typically, means automatic. Although control certain
so-called leavers entry points. doesn't work control stress. Telling
calm down. fact, tends just exacerbate stress. Telling someone else
calm also tends exacerbate stress. want reduce magnitude
stress response, best thing can activate system body
designed calming relaxation. system called
parasympathetic nervous system. mentioned before, neurons
control stress run neck navel. parasympathetic neurons,
para just means near, exist in, cranial nerves. So, kind left
neck lower brainstem. Kind back brain neck pelvic
area. parasympathetic nervous system really interesting especially
cranial nerves, ones brainstem neck area,
direct line various features face, particular, eyes. control
things like eye movements, pupil dilation, things sort, well tongue,
facial muscles, et cetera. parasympathetic nervous system, many people don't
realize this, system control face eyes,
extent, airway, trachea. neurons reside within pelvic area.
Now, neurons within pelvic area involved control genitals,
bladder, rectum. don't direct line. don't direct way
control those. actually go brain spinal cord
organs. Whereas parasympathetic nervous system certain entry points
call leavers will allow push back stress response real time
diminish feel relaxed really quickly. So, going teach first tool
now,

00:24:15 Fastest Way Reduce Stress Real Time: “Respiratory Sinus
Arrhythmia”



don't overwhelm academic knowledge without giving something
useful. tool least knowledge fastest thoroughly
grounded physiology neuroscience calming self-directed way
called physiological sigh, S-I-G-H. Now, might've heard talk
previous podcasts, going explain context
respiration general used calm us down. turns
time, involuntarily. stress, tend forget
can also activate systems voluntarily. extremely powerful set
techniques know scientific studies done lab, Jack
Feldman's lab UCLA, others now very, useful reducing
stress response real time. work. days, seems
lot interest breath work. Breath work typically, go sit
lie deliberately breathe particular way series minutes
order shift physiology, access states. utility
going talk about, not talking now. talking
refer physiological sighs, real medical school textbook relationship
brain, body, body relates breathing apparati,
meaning diaphragm lungs heart. take hallmark stress
response. heart starts beating faster. Blood shuttled big muscles
body move away whatever stressor just make feel like
need move talk. face goes flushed, et cetera. Heart rate, many us feel
involuntary. Just kind functions whether not moving fast moving slow.
think it, not really purely autonomic can speed heart
rate running can slow slowing run. can move
walk lie down. indirect control. however, way can
breathe directly controls heart rate interactions
sympathetic parasympathetic nervous system. works.
inhale, whether not nose mouth, skeletal muscle
inside body called diaphragm, moves down.
lungs expand, diaphragm moves down. heart actually gets little bit bigger
expanded space. space heart. So, not emotional heart
getting bigger. talking actual physical heart getting little bit bigger.
volume grows. consequence, whatever blood now lower


volume moving little bit slowly larger volume
inhaled. Okay? space, heart gets bigger. Blood moves slowly.
little group neurons called sinoatrial node heart registers, believe
not, neurons pay attention rate blood flow heart send
signal brain blood moving slowly heart. brain
sends signal back heart speed heart up. So, means
want heart beat faster, inhale longer, inhale vigorously exhales.
Now, variety ways one that, doesn't matter
nose mouth. inhales longer exhales,
speeding heart. inhales vigorous, even inhales
shorter exhales, speeding heart rate. Now, opposite
also true. want slow heart rate down, stress response hits, want
slow heart rate down, want again, capitalize relationship
body, meaning diaphragm heart brain.
works. exhale, diaphragm moves up, makes heart little bit
smaller. actually gets little compact. Blood flows quickly
compact space sort like just pipe getting smaller. sinoatrial node registers
blood going quickly, sends signal brain. parasympathetic
nervous system, neurons brain stem send signal back heart
slow heart down. So, want calm quickly, need make
exhales longer vigorous inhales. Now, reason
attractive tool controlling stress works real time. doesn't involve
practice go sit anything separate life.
going get emotion. Emotions stress happen real time. so,
wonderful breath work practice opportunity get massage
sit sauna whatever order set stress controls
right direction, tools can reach real time require no learning,
mean, teach you, learn that, doesn't require plasticy
activate pathways. So, feeling stressed, still need inhale, course,
need lengthen exhales. Now, tool capitalizes

00:29:45 Fastlane Calm

kind unique way, kind twist, physiological sigh.


physiological sigh discovered '30s. now explored neuro-
biological level mechanistically far detail Jack Feldman's lab UCLA.
Also Mark Krasnow's lab Stanford. physiological sigh something
humans animals anytime fall asleep. also throughout
sleep time time carbon dioxide, talk moment, builds
much system. physiological sigh something people
naturally start crying trying recover air
calm sobbing hard claustrophobic
environments. However, amazing thing thing call diaphragm,
skeletal muscle, internal organ can control voluntarily, unlike
spleen heart pancreas can't just say, "Oh, want make
pancreas turn little insulin right now. just going mind
directly." can't that. can smelling really good donut
something, can't just directly. can move diaphragm intentionally,
right? can anytime want. it'll run background not
thinking it. So, incredible pathway goes brain diaphragm
called phrenic nerve, P-H-R-E-N-I-C. Phrenic. phrenic nerve innervates
diaphragm. can control anytime want. can double inhales
triple inhales. can exhale inhales. Whatever want do.
incredible organ. physiological sigh something
spontaneously. feeling stressed, can double inhale, [inhales
deeply] [exhales] long exhale. Now, just told minute ago inhale
exhale, going speed heart rate up, promote
stress activation. Now telling double inhale-exhale order calm
down. reason double inhale-exhale physiological sigh takes
advantage fact double inhale, even second inhale
sneaking just tiny bit air, kind hard get deep inhales back
back, big deep inhale another little ones sneaking in, little sacks
lungs. lungs. lungs just two big bags, got
millions little sacks throughout lungs actually make surface area
lungs big tennis court. amazing just spread out. tend
collapse get stressed. carbon dioxide builds bloodstream
one reasons feel agitated well. So, makes us jittery. mean,
effects carbon dioxide don't want get into,


double inhale-exhale, double inhale reinflates little sacks lungs.
long exhale, long exhale now much effective
reading body bloodstream carbon dioxide, relaxes quickly.
lab collaboration David Spiegel's lab, David's Associate Chair
Psychiatry Stanford, study right now exploring physiological sighs
patterns breathing done deliberately can modulate stress response
things related emotionality. work ongoing. want clear
studies aren't done. clear work labs, work Jack
Feldman's lab others, physiological sigh fastest, hardwired way us
eliminate stressful response body quickly real time. so, excited
give tool think people heard mindfulness
meditation good, exercise good us, need getting enough sleep, et
cetera, life happens. find position
alert activated like be, regardless whether not stressor
relationship-based financial physical anything like that, can look
physiological sigh bypasses important feature function,
hard control mind mind, especially
heightened states activation. alert sleepy, hard
use so-called top-down mechanisms intention gratitude things
really powerful tools not super activated stressed not super
tired. anywhere range alert stressed sleepy,
physiological sighs powerful way bringing level so-called autonomic
activation, just means level alertness down. so, whether not
line bank whether not wearing mask nowadays not,
whatever conditions may needs, feeling
stressed, physiological sigh done just one three times, will double inhale,
exhale, double inhale, exhale maybe just two times will bring level stress
very, fast.

00:34:53 Important Notes Heart Rate Deceleration: Vaso-vagal Lag

far know, fastest way accomplish that. important note
physiological sigh exhale-emphasized breathing lowering stress response.
Many people worry heart rate not come fast enough. want tell


not want heart rate reduce fast. actually something
called vasovagal response, people will stand get middle
night use bathroom sudden, collapse, faint.
heart rate reduced much. people will see blood
see something really troubling stressful pass out. over-
activation acceleration calming response. not stressed
kind fall off cliff stress. get stressed rebound mechanism
calming goes high, fast. calmed fast
collapse faint. so, aware going use physiological sigh
exhale-emphasized breathing calm down, heart rate will take 20 30
seconds come baseline. may need repeat physiological sigh
times. So, important note use breathing control levels
stress. thing decide look body control mind,
something else powerful. stressed mind body,
feeling really agitated, activated, worried, use tool like
physiological sigh exhale-emphasized breathing, will notice brain
mind becomes available controlling stress response reacting
it. great sweet spot life be, provided not trying
sleep, alert calm. so, idea. alert calm

00:36:50 Cyclic Sighing Calm Sleep Induction

bring back sort plane alertness.
trouble sleeping just relaxing day, physiological sigh can repeated
10, 15 cycles like. people find actually puts sleep. So,
lie reading many these, actually can put
sleep. find breath work protocols, kind stuff
done away real life, set aside time decide quote unquote,
breath work, works inhales longer
vigorous exhales, tends activating alert you.
exhales longer vigorous inhales, tends put sleep.
many protocols laboratories populate
internet wellness sites whatnot, exhale-emphasized breathing, oftentimes
used tool trying teach people fall asleep. Physiological sigh


little different. designed used real time. Just think just kind kit
things can life happens need react life. note
nasal versus mouth breathing, plethora information now

00:37:57 Nasal Breathing Cosmetic, Immune Performance Enhancement

James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science Lost Art," came
last year. Excellent book. well "Jaws" Sandra Kahn, Paul
Ehrlich foreword Jared Diamond Robert Sapolsky. So, collection
people Stanford. Jared Diamond not Stanford, rest are.
heavy hitters book, benefits nasal breathing. many
cases, nasal breathing advantageous mouth breathing sorts
things. Cosmetic features face, especially kids, warding off infection, et cetera.
physiological sigh, best way double inhale
nose, exhale mouth. can't, can
mouth, just mouth. want nose,
nose. anchors back underlying neurology neuroscience.

00:38:46 Two Breathing Centers Brain

So, want know, two breathing centers. One
involved rhythmic breathing inhales followed exhales, followed inhales
followed exhales. so-called pre-Botzinger nucleus named bottle wine
discovered Jack Feldman UCLA nearby nucleus called parafacial
nucleus also discovered Jack Feldman UCLA. parafacial nucleus
involved time double inhales double exhales. designed
breathe speaking can't always go inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale speaking. So, tell this, not overwhelm
knowledge, just know double inhales double
exhales, activating parafacial nucleus. cool effects.
located near neurons control face, also tendency
relax jaw. interplay neurons control speaking stuff
stuff tongue. So, sudden, physiological sigh,
tap neural circuitry allows us



00:39:45 Breathing Speaking Clearly

speak clearly, control muscles face jaw. Maybe means not
saying certain things stressed, just generally relax. so, brings
us back neuroscience parasympathetic nervous system. calming
system genetically encoded us have, regardless
parents are, neurons control stuff, face, eyes, et
cetera, working together. get stressed, hard us
speak tend jitter kinds things. Just like neurons cause
stress center spinal cord working together get body activated.
Okay, lot science today. now got physiological sigh tool. know
exhale-emphasized breathing will slow heart inhale-emphasized
breathing will speed heart up. So, think something now.

00:40:39 3 Types Stress: Short, Medium Long-Term

think stress not whether not acute chronic, whether not
good us bad us, three different timescales. can arrive
relates emotions. trust me, everything
emotions whether not functioning well emotionally not
functioning well emotionally, whether not coping not coping. So,
typically psychological terms psychological discussions. entering
portal physiology. stuff medical textbooks. will arrive
psychology soon, really want understand difference three
kinds stress three different timescales, short-term, medium-term, long-term,
good bad for. think heard stress bad
us. seen pictures intended frighten us. indeed frightening.
see nice really plump brain left. says healthy control.
see brain says stressed right like withered, see
hippocampus area involved memory smaller. People stressed.
see Alzheimer's brain made worse stress. people
predisposition schizophrenia, get stressed, higher incidence
schizophrenia episodes. hear addicts will relapse stressed.


mean, okay, get it. important, think heard now many
times stress bad.

00:42:10 Positive Effects Short-Term Stress: Immunity Focus

conversation, unfortunately, eclipsed really positive things
stress us short-term. So, stress can short-term, medium-term, long-
term. Long-term stress indeed bad reasons just mentioned many
others. never actually discussed stress terrific for, positive
short-term. think tend overlook important question,
short-term long-term? No one ever bothers tell us chronic,
acute. Right? five minutes? five days? duration final
exams? duration senior thesis college? No one actually draws
boundaries around stuff even general guidelines. so, become bit
mess, frankly, try decipher whole space around stress. So, going try
clean based know scientific data. First
all, acute stress, stress response hits, good immune system.
know might tough pill swallow, absolutely true. fact, stress often
comes form bacterial viral infection. stress response part
organized combat bacterial viral infection. pathways
brain centers activate neurons spinal cord make feel like
want move. neurons brain activate things like spleen,
will deploy killer cells go scavenge incoming bacteria viruses
try eat kill them. So, short-term stress release
adrenaline particular epinephrine, thing, adrenaline epinephrine, good
combating infection. just not discussed enough. So,
discussing here. relates particular tool many ask about,
don't often get opportunity talk appropriate context. not
ever inappropriate talk about, talk now use of,
again, respiration breathing somewhat artificially activate stress response.
will accomplish two things. Okay? return medium long-term stress,
want say short-term stress good dilation pupils, changes
optics eyes, quickening heart rate, sharpening cognition.
fact short-term stress brings certain elements brain online allow


focus. Now, narrows focus. not good seeing so-called big
picture, narrows focus. allows these, call duration path
outcome types analysis. allows evaluate environment, evaluate
need do. primes whole system better cognition. primes immune
system combat infection. makes sense think fact
famine, thirst, bacterial infections, viral infections, invaders, stuff liberates
response body designed get fight back whatever stressor
happens be. Psychological, physical, bacterial, viral. Again, stress response
generic.

00:45:32 Adrenalin (Epinephrine) Deploys Killer Immune Cells

tool takes advantage fact adrenaline released body
adrenals, effect also liberating lot killer cells immune
organs, particular spleen, elsewhere well, interactions
lymphatic system combat infection. way works real world best
captured study can mapped back so-called Wim Hof breathing. Now,
Wim Hof breathing named so-called "Iceman," Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
course, Dutch. He, think self-titled Daredevil. indeed
many, many Guinness Book World Records things like swimming icebergs
going Kilimanjaro shorts crossing desert without water, et cetera.
Things quite dangerous don't know doing. Wim obviously
survived telling survived. two components sort
breathing protocol

00:46:40 Cyclic Deep Breathing Stress: Wim Hof, Tummo & Super-Oxygenation

developed based also called Tummo breathing, T-U-M-M-O.
So, Wim, Tummo breathing. many people call now super
oxygenation breathing. Although breath work aficionados will probably say, well,
not super oxygenation also blowing awful lot carbon dioxide.
talking here, regardless whether not called Wim Hof, Tummo, super
oxygenation, rapid deliberate breathing. So, deliberate hyperventilation.
somebody want this? Well, deliberate hyperventilation done maybe 25 cycles.


inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. Typically, done nose
mouth. Although sometimes just mouth.
15 breaths, 20 breaths, 25 breaths, will feel alert. People anxiety will
feel anxious. might even anxiety attack. However, need ask
kind breathing feels way. pattern breathing, rapid
movements diaphragm will liberate adrenaline adrenals. So,
release adrenaline. mentioned Wim also called "The Iceman." Well,
actually discovered pattern breathing, somewhat. again, maps
back Tummo breathing going cold water. go cold water,
stressor liberate adrenaline response cold water. So, get
ice bath cold shower, will immediately release adrenaline adrenals.
Now, sorts things related psychological control stress
thresholds talk about, really want people understand
adrenaline released body, better position combat infections.
so, whether not breathe quickly cycles 25 breaths regardless
call it, doesn't matter, adrenaline released. take cold shower,
adrenaline released. go ice bath deliberately, even non-
deliberately, adrenaline released. mimicking stress response.
adrenaline serves suppress combat incoming infections. beautifully
shown study published fine journal, "Proceedings
National Academy Sciences US." literally called "Proceedings
National Academy USA" distinguish proceedings national
academies countries. way experiment went people injected
endotoxin cases injected bacterial wall mimics
infection. gives fever. makes feel nauseous. makes feel sick.
not pleasant. Half people particular pattern breathing looked
much like pattern breathing described moment ago 25 deep inhales
exhales followed exhale holding breath. repeating 25 inhales,
exhales holding breath. So, look something like this, listening,
sounds like [inhaling exhaling]. 25, 30 times, start feeling heated up.
start feeling adrenaline response. liberating adrenaline body.
exhale, hold breath 15 seconds repeat. typically,
three four rounds that, inhale deeply hold breath. Now,
want emphasize never ever, ever anywhere near water. People passed


out. So-called shallow water blackout. People died. Don't bathtub. Don't
hot tub. Don't swimming. Please don't anywhere near water.
Please don't all, unless get clearance doctor
pulmonary effects whatnot. breath holds definitely not
done anyone glaucoma pressure concerns eyes. repeated
cycles breathing liberate adrenaline allowed group protocol
essentially experience zero symptoms ejection E. coli,
remarkable. much reduced no symptoms. didn't feel feverish.
didn't feel sick. weren't vomiting, no diarrhea, remarkable, makes total
sense think fact short-term stress response there,
typically called acute stress response,

00:50:58 Inflammation Useful Good, Short Term

designed combat stressors. fact, cut deeply
hike woods, thing happen
rapid inflammation response. always hear inflammation bad. Inflammation
gives us Alzheimer's. Inflammation worst thing. swelling associated,
inflammation associated recruitment things like macrophages microglia
neural tissue. Cells brain body whose job act like little ambulances
rush site clean up. indeed inflammation response looks
horrible, sounds horrible, great thing short-term. want
tissue marked trouble want body brain react it. So,
getting peaks stress time time throughout day throughout week,
better position combat infection. better position heal
wounds, physical wounds. Many great things happen stress response. Now,
course, stress response

00:52:02 Procrastination Self-Manufactured Nootropics

isn't always super intense. Sometimes milder. Sometimes allows us just focus
something deadline. can feel stressful, one
reasons procrastinators there, people always asking can done
procrastination? can done procrastination can understand


happening, self-imposing stress stress acts like drug.
powerful nootropic. get asked nootropics. powerful nootropic
smart drug stress. concern failure. desire well.
impending deadline. the, "Oh gosh, thing now going
fail." best nootropic will ever find. combined good night's
sleep, talk about. spent whole month sleep. So, don't want
backtrack much. Okay. So, short-term stress, great. key able turn
stress response off done, don't want that.

00:53:00 Relaxation Can Causes Illness

fact, just really tamp relationship short-term acute stress
response infection. Many us familiar experience work, work, work,
work, work, taking care loved one, stress, stress, stress, stress, finally
relax. Maybe even go vacation. Like, "Oh, now finally going get break."
get sick. adrenaline response crashed
immune system crashed it. So, please understand this. Now, many might
say, "Well, long? two hours? three hours?" lot really
like specificity, will vary everybody. just kind use rule thumb.
no longer able achieve good sleep, good sleep means you,
please see episodes sleep want tools sleep,
no longer able achieve good sleep, now moving acute stress chronic
stress. need able turn stress response off. one wish, well,
many wishes lifetime, one wish today hope will permeate
spread there, idea need young age, even adults
forever, need learn turn off stress response. Physiological sigh one.
going activate stress response intentionally ice baths, cold showers,
cyclic hyperoxygenated breathing, aka Tummo breathing Wim Hof breathing, also
need learn press brake. Okay? So, think stress system.
knows activate itself.

00:54:30 Immune Activation Protocol

Now talking way deliberately activating stress system order


combat infection. time time. might feel tickle throat like
getting kind run down, will kind breathing. do. will take 25 30 breaths.
Exhale, hold breath. 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold breath 15
seconds. 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold breath 25 30 seconds. big
inhale. hold breath feel impulse breathe. Again, feel safe
me. run doctor, fine. not unless right you.
this. people like ice bath. rarely ice bath. people like
cold showers. like hot showers. So, take hot showers, kind breathing.
Again, less effect

00:55:20 Medium Term Stress: Clear Definition

increasing adrenaline, allows combat infection
activating immune response. Okay. So, now talk medium-term stress.
Medium-term stress going stress lasts anywhere several days
several weeks. Okay. might think long-term stress. times life
just dealing lot. Okay? particular quarter, happened
directing course, lab, this. enjoy things immensely,
kind near threshold. near point additional thing, like
couldn't log onto website day felt like intense thing
world moment. kind laughed myself. Fortunately, caught it.
typically wouldn't response conditions wasn't pushed threshold.

00:56:07 Stress Threshold

medium-term stress? stress threshold? Well, stress threshold
actually ability cognitive re-regulate going body. So, hear
much need unify mind body. need one mind
body whatever. Now realize kind poking fun new agey
language, reason poke fun not don't think value, no
specificity. mean? mean, think always body. never

years end. best tools, best mechanisms know modulate long-

don't surprise you, everyone knows getting regular exercise, getting good sleep,
using real-time tools try tamp stress response, et cetera, going
really useful. data really points fact social connection certain


types social connection particular going mitigate reduce long-
term stress. particularly important issue nowadays
proxies surrogates social connection. online texting people lot,
can feel connected. Like plane's take off everyone's texting
whether not fear flying not. like, "Okay, see you. Love
you. Hate you." Whatever trying communicate people. plane
lands, every phone's out, "See you. Love you. Hate you." hope fewer hate yous.
everyone kind need stay connected one another. Humans
incredibly social creatures. Now, way look whole business social

really key. get oxytocin."

01:08:20 Oxytocin Myth

Actually, know connection individuals rarely causes release
oxytocin? Oxytocin released particular circumstances like post-orgasm, baby

00:10:29 Stress: (Falsely Narrow) Animal Attack Narrative

Okay. So, stress? hear time stress bad. hear people saying
really stressed out. stress? presumably heard arguments
framework stress horrible ancient carryover times
humans pursued animals human predators whenever feel
call stress feel stressed out, just unfortunate invasion
something no longer need modern life, designed
attacked bears tigers lions whatever is. gosh,
unfortunate thing. many creature comforts nowadays, not
eliminated stress. Almost like organ system body
bad us, stuck just species are. first all,
species experience stress. think fair say even though wasn't there,
yes, fact, throughout evolutionary history, vulnerable animal attack
human attacks regular basis point started developing
weapons structures fire things allow us protect
better animals invaders various kinds. entirely naive us
think ancient times, ancient times kind loose term previous
medieval times, 100 years ago, 1000 years ago, 10,000 years ago, course,
infidelities, right? Partners cheated. People died. fact, advent phones,
going talk today, can imagine someone might head off

stressful. So, psychosocial stress. stress
losing loved ones. stress cold, famine. stress
probably also just worry. idea ancient versions humans 1000 years ago,
100 years ago didn't worry, think entirely inconsistent everything know
structure human brain 100 years, 1000 years ago. So, problems

just distinguish stressors, things stress us out, stress,
psychological physiological response stressors. mainly going

doesn't distinguish physical emotional stress. So, happens
stress response hits? talk immediate call acute stress
response. also think short-term stress. So, collection
neurons. name. called sympathetic chain ganglia. nothing
sympathy. Sympa means together. group neurons start
right neck run navel, little bit lower,
called sympathetic chain ganglia. don't need memorize name.
will not quiz. important know middle body,
chain neurons something stresses us out, either mind
something enters environment see something stresses us out,
don't like heights afraid heights, somebody dislike walks room, et
cetera, chain neurons becomes activated like bunch dominoes falling
once. fast. happens, neurons release neuromodulator
neurochemical talked podcast called acetylcholine.
release various sites within body. Now, important normally,
acetylcholine used move muscles. Actually, every time move muscle,
pick cup coffee, write pen, walk street, spinal neurons
connecting muscle releasing acetylcholine. So, brain involved focus
muscles involved making muscles twitch. stressed,
wouldn't want muscles contract just kind like
paralyzed like tonic activation, called. wouldn't want that.
Something called tetanus, believe not. tetanus toxin will cause kind
rigor entire body. not want that. neurons activated,
acetylcholine released, neurons aficionados there.
called postganglionic neurons. ones respond acetylcholine
release epinephrine, equivalent adrenaline. So,
system fast whenever stressed, core body,
neurons middle body release chemicals
adrenaline epinephrine released particular organs acts particular ways.
going weeds here. just stay going make
lot sense will appreciate knowledge hand. epinephrine
acts two different ways. things like muscles legs heart
things need active stressed, certain kind
receptor called beta receptor. beta receptor responds


epinephrine blood vessels dilate. get bigger blood rushes legs.
heart rate speeds up. Lots things happen get activated.
time, epinephrine activates receptors certain tissues don't need.
ones involved digestion, reproduction, things sort luxuries
things going well, not things pay attention stressed.
binds receptors contract blood vessels. So, basically stress
response, key phrase here, stress response A, generic, said
before, B, basically pushes certain systems activated systems
not activated. So, stress response two-pronged. yes certain things
no, may not right now things. So, key thing understand
stress response. heart speeds up. feel blood
certain organs tissues body, not others. throat goes
dry turns get stressed, salivary glands shut down.
lot less blood flow neurons control salivation. so, going
start swallowing. feel like throat getting dry. lot different
effects. not going list off, basically, activated ways
support moving. So, third thing. first all, generic. Second all,
stress response, activate certain things shuts features body.
sense agitation makes want move.
fundamentally, stress response just generic thing says something.
movement case can either bias move terms action, can
bias say something. stressed, likely say something
probably shouldn't say. likely move. trying suppress
movement, feel tremor. going feel agitated
designed move you. So, important want control stress,
need learn work agitation.

00:21:08 Tools Actually Control Stress: Reduce Alertness Increase Calm

like give tool point, think go lot
science, people going begin wonder just going kind standard

name given kind general features alertness calmness body.
Typically, means automatic. Although control certain
so-called leavers entry points. doesn't work control stress. Telling
calm down. fact, tends just exacerbate stress. Telling someone else
calm also tends exacerbate stress. want reduce magnitude
stress response, best thing can activate system body
designed calming relaxation. system called
parasympathetic nervous system. mentioned before, neurons
control stress run neck navel. parasympathetic neurons,
para just means near, exist in, cranial nerves. So, kind left
neck lower brainstem. Kind back brain neck pelvic
area. parasympathetic nervous system really interesting especially
cranial nerves, ones brainstem neck area,
direct line various features face, particular, eyes. control
things like eye movements, pupil dilation, things sort, well tongue,

Now, neurons within pelvic area involved control genitals,
bladder, rectum. don't direct line. don't direct way
control those. actually go brain spinal cord
organs. Whereas parasympathetic nervous system certain entry points
call leavers will allow push back stress response real time

00:29:45 Fastlane Calm

kind unique way, kind twist, physiological sigh.


physiological sigh discovered '30s. now explored neuro-
biological level mechanistically far detail Jack Feldman's lab UCLA.
Also Mark Krasnow's lab Stanford. physiological sigh something
humans animals anytime fall asleep. also throughout
sleep time time carbon dioxide, talk moment, builds
much system. physiological sigh something people
naturally start crying trying recover air
calm sobbing hard claustrophobic
environments. However, amazing thing thing call diaphragm,
skeletal muscle, internal organ can control voluntarily, unlike
spleen heart pancreas can't just say, "Oh, want make
pancreas turn little insulin right now. just going mind
directly." can't that. can smelling really good donut
something, can't just directly. can move diaphragm intentionally,
right? can anytime want. it'll run background not
thinking it. So, incredible pathway goes brain diaphragm
called phrenic nerve, P-H-R-E-N-I-C. Phrenic. phrenic nerve innervates
diaphragm. can control anytime want. can double inhales
triple inhales. can exhale inhales. Whatever want do.
incredible organ. physiological sigh something
spontaneously. feeling stressed, can double inhale, [inhales
deeply] [exhales] long exhale. Now, just told minute ago inhale
exhale, going speed heart rate up, promote
stress activation. Now telling double inhale-exhale order calm
down. reason double inhale-exhale physiological sigh takes
advantage fact double inhale, even second inhale
sneaking just tiny bit air, kind hard get deep inhales back
back, big deep inhale another little ones sneaking in, little sacks
lungs. lungs. lungs just two big bags, got
millions little sacks throughout lungs actually make surface area
lungs big tennis court. amazing just spread out. tend
collapse get stressed. carbon dioxide builds bloodstream
one reasons feel agitated well. So, makes us jittery. mean,
effects carbon dioxide don't want get into,


double inhale-exhale, double inhale reinflates little sacks lungs.
long exhale, long exhale now much effective
reading body bloodstream carbon dioxide, relaxes quickly.
lab collaboration David Spiegel's lab, David's Associate Chair

exhale, double inhale, exhale maybe just two times will bring level stress
very, fast.

00:34:53 Important Notes Heart Rate Deceleration: Vaso-vagal Lag

far know, fastest way accomplish that. important note
physiological sigh exhale-emphasized breathing lowering stress response.
Many people worry heart rate not come fast enough. want tell


not want heart rate reduce fast. actually something
called vasovagal response, people will stand get middle
night use bathroom sudden, collapse, faint.
heart rate reduced much. people will see blood
see something really troubling stressful pass out. over-
activation acceleration calming response. not stressed
kind fall off cliff stress. get stressed rebound mechanism
calming goes high, fast. calmed fast
collapse faint. so, aware going use physiological sigh
exhale-emphasized breathing calm down, heart rate will take 20 30
seconds come baseline. may need repeat physiological sigh
times. So, important note use breathing control levels
stress. thing decide look body control mind,
something else powerful. stressed mind body,
feeling really agitated, activated, worried, use tool like
physiological sigh exhale-emphasized breathing, will notice brain
mind becomes available controlling stress response reacting
it. great sweet spot life be, provided not trying
sleep, alert calm. so, idea. alert calm

00:36:50 Cyclic Sighing Calm Sleep Induction

bring back sort plane alertness.
trouble sleeping just relaxing day, physiological sigh can repeated
10, 15 cycles like. people find actually puts sleep. So,
lie reading many these, actually can put
sleep. find breath work protocols, kind stuff
done away real life, set aside time decide quote unquote,
breath work, works inhales longer

exhales longer vigorous inhales, tends put sleep.
many protocols laboratories populate
internet wellness sites whatnot, exhale-emphasized breathing, oftentimes
used tool trying teach people fall asleep. Physiological sigh


little different. designed used real time. Just think just kind kit
things can life happens need react life. note
nasal versus mouth breathing, plethora information now

00:37:57 Nasal Breathing Cosmetic, Immune Performance Enhancement

James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science Lost Art," came
last year. Excellent book. well "Jaws" Sandra Kahn, Paul
Ehrlich foreword Jared Diamond Robert Sapolsky. So, collection
people Stanford. Jared Diamond not Stanford, rest are.
heavy hitters book, benefits nasal breathing. many
cases, nasal breathing advantageous mouth breathing sorts
things. Cosmetic features face, especially kids, warding off infection, et cetera.
physiological sigh, best way double inhale
nose, exhale mouth. can't, can
mouth, just mouth. want nose,
nose. anchors back underlying neurology neuroscience.

00:38:46 Two Breathing Centers Brain

So, want know, two breathing centers. One
involved rhythmic breathing inhales followed exhales, followed inhales
followed exhales. so-called pre-Botzinger nucleus named bottle wine
discovered Jack Feldman UCLA nearby nucleus called parafacial
nucleus also discovered Jack Feldman UCLA. parafacial nucleus
involved time double inhales double exhales. designed
breathe speaking can't always go inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale speaking. So, tell this, not overwhelm
knowledge, just know double inhales double
exhales, activating parafacial nucleus. cool effects.
located near neurons control face, also tendency
relax jaw. interplay neurons control speaking stuff
stuff tongue. So, sudden, physiological sigh,
tap neural circuitry allows us



00:39:45 Breathing Speaking Clearly

speak clearly, control muscles face jaw. Maybe means not
saying certain things stressed, just generally relax. so, brings
us back neuroscience parasympathetic nervous system. calming
system genetically encoded us have, regardless
parents are, neurons control stuff, face, eyes, et
cetera, working together. get stressed, hard us
speak tend jitter kinds things. Just like neurons cause
stress center spinal cord working together get body activated.
Okay, lot science today. now got physiological sigh tool. know
exhale-emphasized breathing will slow heart inhale-emphasized
breathing will speed heart up. So, think something now.

00:40:39 3 Types Stress: Short, Medium Long-Term

think stress not whether not acute chronic, whether not
good us bad us, three different timescales. can arrive
relates emotions. trust me, everything
emotions whether not functioning well emotionally not
functioning well emotionally, whether not coping not coping. So,
typically psychological terms psychological discussions. entering
portal physiology. stuff medical textbooks. will arrive
psychology soon, really want understand difference three
kinds stress three different timescales, short-term, medium-term, long-term,
good bad for. think heard stress bad
us. seen pictures intended frighten us. indeed frightening.
see nice really plump brain left. says healthy control.
see brain says stressed right like withered, see
hippocampus area involved memory smaller. People stressed.
see Alzheimer's brain made worse stress. people
predisposition schizophrenia, get stressed, higher incidence
schizophrenia episodes. hear addicts will relapse stressed.


mean, okay, get it. important, think heard now many
times stress bad.

00:42:10 Positive Effects Short-Term Stress: Immunity Focus

conversation, unfortunately, eclipsed really positive things
stress us short-term. So, stress can short-term, medium-term, long-
term. Long-term stress indeed bad reasons just mentioned many
others. never actually discussed stress terrific for, positive
short-term. think tend overlook important question,
short-term long-term? No one ever bothers tell us chronic,
acute. Right? five minutes? five days? duration final
exams? duration senior thesis college? No one actually draws
boundaries around stuff even general guidelines. so, become bit
mess, frankly, try decipher whole space around stress. So, going try
clean based know scientific data. First
all, acute stress, stress response hits, good immune system.
know might tough pill swallow, absolutely true. fact, stress often
comes form bacterial viral infection. stress response part
organized combat bacterial viral infection. pathways
brain centers activate neurons spinal cord make feel like
want move. neurons brain activate things like spleen,
will deploy killer cells go scavenge incoming bacteria viruses
try eat kill them. So, short-term stress release
adrenaline particular epinephrine, thing, adrenaline epinephrine, good
combating infection. just not discussed enough. So,
discussing here. relates particular tool many ask about,
don't often get opportunity talk appropriate context. not
ever inappropriate talk about, talk now use of,
again, respiration breathing somewhat artificially activate stress response.
will accomplish two things. Okay? return medium long-term stress,
want say short-term stress good dilation pupils, changes
optics eyes, quickening heart rate, sharpening cognition.
fact short-term stress brings certain elements brain online allow


focus. Now, narrows focus. not good seeing so-called big
picture, narrows focus. allows these, call duration path
outcome types analysis. allows evaluate environment, evaluate
need do. primes whole system better cognition. primes immune
system combat infection. makes sense think fact
famine, thirst, bacterial infections, viral infections, invaders, stuff liberates
response body designed get fight back whatever stressor
happens be. Psychological, physical, bacterial, viral. Again, stress response
generic.

00:45:32 Adrenalin (Epinephrine) Deploys Killer Immune Cells

tool takes advantage fact adrenaline released body
adrenals, effect also liberating lot killer cells immune
organs, particular spleen, elsewhere well, interactions
lymphatic system combat infection. way works real world best
captured study can mapped back so-called Wim Hof breathing. Now,
Wim Hof breathing named so-called "Iceman," Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
course, Dutch. He, think self-titled Daredevil. indeed
many, many Guinness Book World Records things like swimming icebergs
going Kilimanjaro shorts crossing desert without water, et cetera.
Things quite dangerous don't know doing. Wim obviously
survived telling survived. two components sort
breathing protocol

00:46:40 Cyclic Deep Breathing Stress: Wim Hof, Tummo & Super-Oxygenation

developed based also called Tummo breathing, T-U-M-M-O.
So, Wim, Tummo breathing. many people call now super
oxygenation breathing. Although breath work aficionados will probably say, well,
not super oxygenation also blowing awful lot carbon dioxide.
talking here, regardless whether not called Wim Hof, Tummo, super
oxygenation, rapid deliberate breathing. So, deliberate hyperventilation.
somebody want this? Well, deliberate hyperventilation done maybe 25 cycles.


inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. Typically, done nose
mouth. Although sometimes just mouth.
15 breaths, 20 breaths, 25 breaths, will feel alert. People anxiety will
feel anxious. might even anxiety attack. However, need ask
kind breathing feels way. pattern breathing, rapid
movements diaphragm will liberate adrenaline adrenals. So,
release adrenaline. mentioned Wim also called "The Iceman." Well,
actually discovered pattern breathing, somewhat. again, maps
back Tummo breathing going cold water. go cold water,
stressor liberate adrenaline response cold water. So, get
ice bath cold shower, will immediately release adrenaline adrenals.
Now, sorts things related psychological control stress
thresholds talk about, really want people understand
adrenaline released body, better position combat infections.
so, whether not breathe quickly cycles 25 breaths regardless
call it, doesn't matter, adrenaline released. take cold shower,
adrenaline released. go ice bath deliberately, even non-
deliberately, adrenaline released. mimicking stress response.
adrenaline serves suppress combat incoming infections. beautifully
shown study published fine journal, "Proceedings
National Academy Sciences US." literally called "Proceedings
National Academy USA" distinguish proceedings national
academies countries. way experiment went people injected
endotoxin cases injected bacterial wall mimics
infection. gives fever. makes feel nauseous. makes feel sick.
not pleasant. Half people particular pattern breathing looked
much like pattern breathing described moment ago 25 deep inhales
exhales followed exhale holding breath. repeating 25 inhales,
exhales holding breath. So, look something like this, listening,
sounds like [inhaling exhaling]. 25, 30 times, start feeling heated up.
start feeling adrenaline response. liberating adrenaline body.
exhale, hold breath 15 seconds repeat. typically,
three four rounds that, inhale deeply hold breath. Now,
want emphasize never ever, ever anywhere near water. People passed


out. So-called shallow water blackout. People died. Don't bathtub. Don't
hot tub. Don't swimming. Please don't anywhere near water.
Please don't all, unless get clearance doctor
pulmonary effects whatnot. breath holds definitely not
done anyone glaucoma pressure concerns eyes. repeated
cycles breathing liberate adrenaline allowed group protocol
essentially experience zero symptoms ejection E. coli,
remarkable. much reduced no symptoms. didn't feel feverish.
didn't feel sick. weren't vomiting, no diarrhea, remarkable, makes total
sense think fact short-term stress response there,
typically called acute stress response,

00:50:58 Inflammation Useful Good, Short Term

designed combat stressors. fact, cut deeply
hike woods, thing happen
rapid inflammation response. always hear inflammation bad. Inflammation
gives us Alzheimer's. Inflammation worst thing. swelling associated,
inflammation associated recruitment things like macrophages microglia
neural tissue. Cells brain body whose job act like little ambulances
rush site clean up. indeed inflammation response looks
horrible, sounds horrible, great thing short-term. want
tissue marked trouble want body brain react it. So,
getting peaks stress time time throughout day throughout week,
better position combat infection. better position heal
wounds, physical wounds. Many great things happen stress response. Now,
course, stress response

00:52:02 Procrastination Self-Manufactured Nootropics

isn't always super intense. Sometimes milder. Sometimes allows us just focus
something deadline. can feel stressful, one
reasons procrastinators there, people always asking can done
procrastination? can done procrastination can understand


happening, self-imposing stress stress acts like drug.
powerful nootropic. get asked nootropics. powerful nootropic
smart drug stress. concern failure. desire well.
impending deadline. the, "Oh gosh, thing now going
fail." best nootropic will ever find. combined good night's
sleep, talk about. spent whole month sleep. So, don't want
backtrack much. Okay. So, short-term stress, great. key able turn
stress response off done, don't want that.

00:53:00 Relaxation Can Causes Illness

fact, just really tamp relationship short-term acute stress
response infection. Many us familiar experience work, work, work,
work, work, taking care loved one, stress, stress, stress, stress, finally
relax. Maybe even go vacation. Like, "Oh, now finally going get break."
get sick. adrenaline response crashed
immune system crashed it. So, please understand this. Now, many might
say, "Well, long? two hours? three hours?" lot really
like specificity, will vary everybody. just kind use rule thumb.
no longer able achieve good sleep, good sleep means you,
please see episodes sleep want tools sleep,
no longer able achieve good sleep, now moving acute stress chronic
stress. need able turn stress response off. one wish, well,
many wishes lifetime, one wish today hope will permeate
spread there, idea need young age, even adults
forever, need learn turn off stress response. Physiological sigh one.
going activate stress response intentionally ice baths, cold showers,
cyclic hyperoxygenated breathing, aka Tummo breathing Wim Hof breathing, also
need learn press brake. Okay? So, think stress system.
knows activate itself.

00:54:30 Immune Activation Protocol

Now talking way deliberately activating stress system order


combat infection. time time. might feel tickle throat like
getting kind run down, will kind breathing. do. will take 25 30 breaths.
Exhale, hold breath. 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold breath 15
seconds. 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold breath 25 30 seconds. big
inhale. hold breath feel impulse breathe. Again, feel safe
me. run doctor, fine. not unless right you.
this. people like ice bath. rarely ice bath. people like
cold showers. like hot showers. So, take hot showers, kind breathing.
Again, less effect

00:55:20 Medium Term Stress: Clear Definition

increasing adrenaline, allows combat infection

Medium-term stress going stress lasts anywhere several days

years end. best tools, best mechanisms know modulate long-
term stress might surprise little bit. First all, going things
don't surprise you, everyone knows getting regular exercise, getting good sleep,
using real-time tools try tamp stress response, et cetera, going
really useful. data really points fact social connection certain


types social connection particular going mitigate reduce long-
term stress. particularly important issue nowadays
proxies surrogates social connection. online texting people lot,
can feel connected. Like plane's take off everyone's texting
whether not fear flying not. like, "Okay, see you. Love
you. Hate you." Whatever trying communicate people. plane
lands, every phone's out, "See you. Love you. Hate you." hope fewer hate yous.
everyone kind need stay connected one another. Humans
incredibly social creatures. Now, way look whole business social
connection, not just kind wishy-washy new agey perspective. want
point sometimes say wishy-washy new agey. nothing that.
just, goal always put scientific data neurochemistry things
wishy-washy new agey stuff, also can arm
arguments members family life maybe
aren't tuned typical language around practices like, "Oh, connection
really key. get oxytocin."

01:08:20 Oxytocin Myth

Actually, know connection individuals rarely causes release
oxytocin? Oxytocin released particular circumstances like post-orgasm, baby
mother milk let down. associated kind really intense kinds pair bonding
things mother child. Also father child, especially mother child,
relationship lactation system. Couples post-sex. kinds things
reflect deep kind layers biology. oxytocin not just released
walk pat dog head see somebody give hug and,
"Hi, great see you," fist bump. not situation oxytocin. way think
social connection can mitigate long-term effects stress
really systems neuromodulation

01:09:15 Serotonin: Satiety, Safety

like serotonin, blocking certain things really bad us feel
socially isolated. Things like Taqi Kynan. So, let explain are. Serotonin


again, neuromodulator. Neuromodulators little bit like playlists brain.
tend amplify bias likelihood certain brain circuits body circuits
going activated others will not. Serotonin generally, realize
speaking generally here, generally gives us feelings wellbeing. high
levels, makes us feel blissed tends make us feel like enough
immediate environment. side effects antidepressants
elevate serotonin, actually can help lot people depressive symptoms.
side effects associated drugs increase serotonin tend reduced affect.
tend kind blunt affect make people feel like libido lower. Desire goes
body much serotonin brain much serotonin,
one feels like enough. serotonin, pharmacology aside taking
antidepressants aside topic another time, serotonin tends make us feel good.
see somebody recognize trust, serotonin released brain.
certain positive effects immune system systems
neural repair synopsis things really reinforce connections brain
prevent long-term withering connections. So, serotonin tied social
connection. Now, social connection can take many forms. many know,

don't know. even awake, don't really know ask him.
seems less attached well. no scientific evidence
human-human attachment. attachments humans well.
can attachments people. can romantic attachments.
familial attachments non-romantic, friendship, pets, even
attachments things just delight us. One things really can mitigate
long-term negative effects chronic long-term stress isn't just fun.
hear stuff, "You need play fun." can little bit tough
concept, especially hard driving people people stressed,
sense delight, sense really enjoying something see engage in,
witness, participate in, associated serotonin system. certainly,
play one things. Social connection various forms. things
invest in. people might say, "Well, nobody wants friend,"

01:12:00 Delight Flexibility



or, "Nobody wants engage socially anymore." first admit, social
connection friendship relationships kinds animals humans
inanimate objects takes work. takes investment. takes time not needing everything
exactly way want be. friend struggles
oftentimes conversations just circle back fact want social
connection, often flexible. eat people's
schedules. Sometimes eat things don't necessarily want eat
moment stay little later wake little earlier. Social connection
something work for, incredibly powerful. want to, course, tip heart

molecule makes us fearful, paranoid, impairs immune system. so,
Taqi Kynan like internal punishment signal. like body brain telling
us, "You're not spending enough time people really trust. not
spending time things really enjoy." often think Taqi Kynan

yes, can reduce anxiety stress, also can reduce output adrenals



01:19:15 Adrenal Burnout Myth… Need Know Anyway

point can become problematic. Now, note adrenal burnout.
actually no thing adrenal burnout normal conditions. adrenals
enough adrenaline support 200 years stress better, worse. concept
adrenal burnout origins work Nobel Prize winner, Hans Selye, actually
discovered called general adaptation syndrome. discovered lot
things stress. phenomenal work turned true.
stressors. something called distress. talked eustress,
positive stress. Eustress never really caught kind general
discussion. theory stress went long enough,
eventually reach phase called exhaustion. turned wrong. Although
many may feel exhausted chronic stress, isn't really physiological
exhaustion happens. eventually got picked ran general
public. talk adrenal burnout. much coffee, adrenal burnout. hear
stuff. no thing adrenal burnout. adrenals don't burn out.
something, however, called adrenal insufficiency syndrome, real
physiological problem people impaired adrenals can't
produce adrenaline. melatonin taken high levels periods time
long can cause suppression cortisol epinephrine released
adrenals can create kind pseudo adrenal insufficiency syndrome. So, aware
melatonin reason. Please, trying, alone can't get rid phrase adrenal

reasons. not adrenals burnt out. Unless
happen adrenal insufficiency syndrome. So, not fan melatonin lot
reasons. Now mentioned several.

01:21:10 L-Theanine Stress Reduction Task Completion Anxiety

internal state stress calm matches demands us mismatched
demands us, tend interpret good bad. Let give
example. feeling anxious, stressed inside, lot do,

mismatch. not right internal state, internal state
incorrect rather, meet demands placed upon me. So, cases,
whether tired stressed need do, valence, meaning

might call number things, not good. However, tired want
fall asleep, well feel good demand is. need go sleep
tired. wide awake need fall asleep, not good.
brain tends go direction interpreting situation bad one. So,
discussion around emotions far nuanced elaborate this,
one way think relationship emotions whether not internal state

00:10:29 Stress: (Falsely Narrow) Animal Attack Narrative

Okay. So, stress? hear time stress bad. hear people saying
really stressed out. stress? presumably heard arguments
framework stress horrible ancient carryover times
humans pursued animals human predators whenever feel
call stress feel stressed out, just unfortunate invasion
something no longer need modern life, designed
attacked bears tigers lions whatever is. gosh,
unfortunate thing. many creature comforts nowadays, not
eliminated stress. Almost like organ system body
bad us, stuck just species are. first all,
species experience stress. think fair say even though wasn't there,
yes, fact, throughout evolutionary history, vulnerable animal attack
human attacks regular basis point started developing
weapons structures fire things allow us protect
better animals invaders various kinds. entirely naive us
think ancient times, ancient times kind loose term previous
medieval times, 100 years ago, 1000 years ago, 10,000 years ago, course,
infidelities, right? Partners cheated. People died. fact, advent phones,
going talk today, can imagine someone might head off

stressful. So, psychosocial stress. stress
losing loved ones. stress cold, famine. stress
probably also just worry. idea ancient versions humans 1000 years ago,
100 years ago didn't worry, think entirely inconsistent everything know
structure human brain 100 years, 1000 years ago. So, problems
struggling existed forever. just stress core generalized

thing. gives certain advantage taking state brain body,
also gives you, us advantage controlling based hard-

00:14:31 Stress RESPONSE: Generic, Channels blood, Biases Action

evolving tools. laboratories well. So,
talk stress response. that, will understand exactly
tools going give work. saying, "Wait, just want
tools. Just give summary," trust me, understand mechanism, going
far better position incorporate tools, teach tools others,
modify life circumstances change. like cheat sheet
just want one-page PDF, eventually get stuff people, really
important understand underlying mechanism. Okay. So, stress? Well,
just distinguish stressors, things stress us out, stress,
psychological physiological response stressors. mainly going
talk stress, response things. clear already
know, stressors can psychological can physical. Okay?
put outside cold day without jacket long time, stressful.
prepare many exams can't balance
sleep schedule needs comfort wellbeing, like food, rest, sleep,
social connection, stressful. So, stress, mentioned before, generic.


doesn't distinguish physical emotional stress. So, happens
stress response hits? talk immediate call acute stress
response. also think short-term stress. So, collection
neurons. name. called sympathetic chain ganglia. nothing
sympathy. Sympa means together. group neurons start
right neck run navel, little bit lower,
called sympathetic chain ganglia. don't need memorize name.
will not quiz. important know middle body,
chain neurons something stresses us out, either mind
something enters environment see something stresses us out,
don't like heights afraid heights, somebody dislike walks room, et
cetera, chain neurons becomes activated like bunch dominoes falling
once. fast. happens, neurons release neuromodulator
neurochemical talked podcast called acetylcholine.
release various sites within body. Now, important normally,
acetylcholine used move muscles. Actually, every time move muscle,
pick cup coffee, write pen, walk street, spinal neurons
connecting muscle releasing acetylcholine. So, brain involved focus
muscles involved making muscles twitch. stressed,
wouldn't want muscles contract just kind like
paralyzed like tonic activation, called. wouldn't want that.
Something called tetanus, believe not. tetanus toxin will cause kind
rigor entire body. not want that. neurons activated,
acetylcholine released, neurons aficionados there.
called postganglionic neurons. ones respond acetylcholine
release epinephrine, equivalent adrenaline. So,
system fast whenever stressed, core body,
neurons middle body release chemicals
adrenaline epinephrine released particular organs acts particular ways.
going weeds here. just stay going make
lot sense will appreciate knowledge hand. epinephrine
acts two different ways. things like muscles legs heart
things need active stressed, certain kind
receptor called beta receptor. beta receptor responds


epinephrine blood vessels dilate. get bigger blood rushes legs.
heart rate speeds up. Lots things happen get activated.
time, epinephrine activates receptors certain tissues don't need.
ones involved digestion, reproduction, things sort luxuries
things going well, not things pay attention stressed.
binds receptors contract blood vessels. So, basically stress
response, key phrase here, stress response A, generic, said
before, B, basically pushes certain systems activated systems
not activated. So, stress response two-pronged. yes certain things
no, may not right now things. So, key thing understand
stress response. heart speeds up. feel blood
certain organs tissues body, not others. throat goes
dry turns get stressed, salivary glands shut down.
lot less blood flow neurons control salivation. so, going
start swallowing. feel like throat getting dry. lot different
effects. not going list off, basically, activated ways
support moving. So, third thing. first all, generic. Second all,
stress response, activate certain things shuts features body.
sense agitation makes want move.
fundamentally, stress response just generic thing says something.
movement case can either bias move terms action, can
bias say something. stressed, likely say something
probably shouldn't say. likely move. trying suppress
movement, feel tremor. going feel agitated
designed move you. So, important want control stress,
need learn work agitation.

00:21:08 Tools Actually Control Stress: Reduce Alertness Increase Calm

like give tool point, think go lot
science, people going begin wonder just going kind standard
university lecture stress response. going give signs
stress response, want take now already know stress response
use framework thinking one might reduce even eliminate


stress response quickly real time, arise don't want it. So,
taking podium sitting Zoom call, sudden feeling
flushed. feeling like heart racing. feeling little alert. feeling
little worked want calm down. far aware of, best tools
reduce stress quickly, so-called real-time tools going tools direct
line so-called autonomic nervous system. autonomic nervous system
name given kind general features alertness calmness body.
Typically, means automatic. Although control certain
so-called leavers entry points. doesn't work control stress. Telling
calm down. fact, tends just exacerbate stress. Telling someone else
calm also tends exacerbate stress. want reduce magnitude
stress response, best thing can activate system body
designed calming relaxation. system called
parasympathetic nervous system. mentioned before, neurons
control stress run neck navel. parasympathetic neurons,
para just means near, exist in, cranial nerves. So, kind left
neck lower brainstem. Kind back brain neck pelvic
area. parasympathetic nervous system really interesting especially
cranial nerves, ones brainstem neck area,
direct line various features face, particular, eyes. control
things like eye movements, pupil dilation, things sort, well tongue,
facial muscles, et cetera. parasympathetic nervous system, many people don't
realize this, system control face eyes,
extent, airway, trachea. neurons reside within pelvic area.
Now, neurons within pelvic area involved control genitals,
bladder, rectum. don't direct line. don't direct way
control those. actually go brain spinal cord
organs. Whereas parasympathetic nervous system certain entry points
call leavers will allow push back stress response real time
diminish feel relaxed really quickly. So, going teach first tool

need lengthen exhales. Now, tool capitalizes

00:29:45 Fastlane Calm

kind unique way, kind twist, physiological sigh.


physiological sigh discovered '30s. now explored neuro-
biological level mechanistically far detail Jack Feldman's lab UCLA.
Also Mark Krasnow's lab Stanford. physiological sigh something
humans animals anytime fall asleep. also throughout
sleep time time carbon dioxide, talk moment, builds
much system. physiological sigh something people
naturally start crying trying recover air
calm sobbing hard claustrophobic
environments. However, amazing thing thing call diaphragm,
skeletal muscle, internal organ can control voluntarily, unlike
spleen heart pancreas can't just say, "Oh, want make
pancreas turn little insulin right now. just going mind
directly." can't that. can smelling really good donut
something, can't just directly. can move diaphragm intentionally,
right? can anytime want. it'll run background not
thinking it. So, incredible pathway goes brain diaphragm
called phrenic nerve, P-H-R-E-N-I-C. Phrenic. phrenic nerve innervates
diaphragm. can control anytime want. can double inhales
triple inhales. can exhale inhales. Whatever want do.
incredible organ. physiological sigh something
spontaneously. feeling stressed, can double inhale, [inhales
deeply] [exhales] long exhale. Now, just told minute ago inhale
exhale, going speed heart rate up, promote
stress activation. Now telling double inhale-exhale order calm
down. reason double inhale-exhale physiological sigh takes
advantage fact double inhale, even second inhale
sneaking just tiny bit air, kind hard get deep inhales back
back, big deep inhale another little ones sneaking in, little sacks
lungs. lungs. lungs just two big bags, got
millions little sacks throughout lungs actually make surface area
lungs big tennis court. amazing just spread out. tend
collapse get stressed. carbon dioxide builds bloodstream
one reasons feel agitated well. So, makes us jittery. mean,
effects carbon dioxide don't want get into,


double inhale-exhale, double inhale reinflates little sacks lungs.
long exhale, long exhale now much effective
reading body bloodstream carbon dioxide, relaxes quickly.
lab collaboration David Spiegel's lab, David's Associate Chair
Psychiatry Stanford, study right now exploring physiological sighs
patterns breathing done deliberately can modulate stress response
things related emotionality. work ongoing. want clear
studies aren't done. clear work labs, work Jack
Feldman's lab others, physiological sigh fastest, hardwired way us
eliminate stressful response body quickly real time. so, excited
give tool think people heard mindfulness
meditation good, exercise good us, need getting enough sleep, et
cetera, life happens. find position
alert activated like be, regardless whether not stressor
relationship-based financial physical anything like that, can look
physiological sigh bypasses important feature function,
hard control mind mind, especially
heightened states activation. alert sleepy, hard
use so-called top-down mechanisms intention gratitude things
really powerful tools not super activated stressed not super
tired. anywhere range alert stressed sleepy,
physiological sighs powerful way bringing level so-called autonomic
activation, just means level alertness down. so, whether not
line bank whether not wearing mask nowadays not,
whatever conditions may needs, feeling
stressed, physiological sigh done just one three times, will double inhale,
exhale, double inhale, exhale maybe just two times will bring level stress
very, fast.

00:34:53 Important Notes Heart Rate Deceleration: Vaso-vagal Lag

far know, fastest way accomplish that. important note
physiological sigh exhale-emphasized breathing lowering stress response.
Many people worry heart rate not come fast enough. want tell


not want heart rate reduce fast. actually something
called vasovagal response, people will stand get middle
night use bathroom sudden, collapse, faint.
heart rate reduced much. people will see blood
see something really troubling stressful pass out. over-
activation acceleration calming response. not stressed
kind fall off cliff stress. get stressed rebound mechanism
calming goes high, fast. calmed fast
collapse faint. so, aware going use physiological sigh
exhale-emphasized breathing calm down, heart rate will take 20 30
seconds come baseline. may need repeat physiological sigh
times. So, important note use breathing control levels
stress. thing decide look body control mind,
something else powerful. stressed mind body,
feeling really agitated, activated, worried, use tool like
physiological sigh exhale-emphasized breathing, will notice brain
mind becomes available controlling stress response reacting
it. great sweet spot life be, provided not trying
sleep, alert calm. so, idea. alert calm

00:36:50 Cyclic Sighing Calm Sleep Induction

bring back sort plane alertness.
trouble sleeping just relaxing day, physiological sigh can repeated
10, 15 cycles like. people find actually puts sleep. So,
lie reading many these, actually can put
sleep. find breath work protocols, kind stuff
done away real life, set aside time decide quote unquote,
breath work, works inhales longer
vigorous exhales, tends activating alert you.
exhales longer vigorous inhales, tends put sleep.
many protocols laboratories populate
internet wellness sites whatnot, exhale-emphasized breathing, oftentimes
used tool trying teach people fall asleep. Physiological sigh


little different. designed used real time. Just think just kind kit
things can life happens need react life. note
nasal versus mouth breathing, plethora information now

00:37:57 Nasal Breathing Cosmetic, Immune Performance Enhancement

James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science Lost Art," came
last year. Excellent book. well "Jaws" Sandra Kahn, Paul
Ehrlich foreword Jared Diamond Robert Sapolsky. So, collection
people Stanford. Jared Diamond not Stanford, rest are.
heavy hitters book, benefits nasal breathing. many
cases, nasal breathing advantageous mouth breathing sorts
things. Cosmetic features face, especially kids, warding off infection, et cetera.
physiological sigh, best way double inhale
nose, exhale mouth. can't, can
mouth, just mouth. want nose,
nose. anchors back underlying neurology neuroscience.

00:38:46 Two Breathing Centers Brain

So, want know, two breathing centers. One
involved rhythmic breathing inhales followed exhales, followed inhales
followed exhales. so-called pre-Botzinger nucleus named bottle wine
discovered Jack Feldman UCLA nearby nucleus called parafacial
nucleus also discovered Jack Feldman UCLA. parafacial nucleus
involved time double inhales double exhales. designed
breathe speaking can't always go inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale speaking. So, tell this, not overwhelm
knowledge, just know double inhales double
exhales, activating parafacial nucleus. cool effects.
located near neurons control face, also tendency
relax jaw. interplay neurons control speaking stuff
stuff tongue. So, sudden, physiological sigh,
tap neural circuitry allows us



00:39:45 Breathing Speaking Clearly

speak clearly, control muscles face jaw. Maybe means not
saying certain things stressed, just generally relax. so, brings
us back neuroscience parasympathetic nervous system. calming
system genetically encoded us have, regardless
parents are, neurons control stuff, face, eyes, et
cetera, working together. get stressed, hard us
speak tend jitter kinds things. Just like neurons cause
stress center spinal cord working together get body activated.
Okay, lot science today. now got physiological sigh tool. know
exhale-emphasized breathing will slow heart inhale-emphasized
breathing will speed heart up. So, think something now.

00:40:39 3 Types Stress: Short, Medium Long-Term

think stress not whether not acute chronic, whether not
good us bad us, three different timescales. can arrive
relates emotions. trust me, everything
emotions whether not functioning well emotionally not
functioning well emotionally, whether not coping not coping. So,
typically psychological terms psychological discussions. entering
portal physiology. stuff medical textbooks. will arrive
psychology soon, really want understand difference three
kinds stress three different timescales, short-term, medium-term, long-term,
good bad for. think heard stress bad
us. seen pictures intended frighten us. indeed frightening.
see nice really plump brain left. says healthy control.
see brain says stressed right like withered, see
hippocampus area involved memory smaller. People stressed.
see Alzheimer's brain made worse stress. people
predisposition schizophrenia, get stressed, higher incidence
schizophrenia episodes. hear addicts will relapse stressed.


mean, okay, get it. important, think heard now many
times stress bad.

00:42:10 Positive Effects Short-Term Stress: Immunity Focus

conversation, unfortunately, eclipsed really positive things
stress us short-term. So, stress can short-term, medium-term, long-
term. Long-term stress indeed bad reasons just mentioned many
others. never actually discussed stress terrific for, positive
short-term. think tend overlook important question,
short-term long-term? No one ever bothers tell us chronic,
acute. Right? five minutes? five days? duration final
exams? duration senior thesis college? No one actually draws
boundaries around stuff even general guidelines. so, become bit
mess, frankly, try decipher whole space around stress. So, going try
clean based know scientific data. First
all, acute stress, stress response hits, good immune system.
know might tough pill swallow, absolutely true. fact, stress often
comes form bacterial viral infection. stress response part
organized combat bacterial viral infection. pathways
brain centers activate neurons spinal cord make feel like
want move. neurons brain activate things like spleen,
will deploy killer cells go scavenge incoming bacteria viruses
try eat kill them. So, short-term stress release
adrenaline particular epinephrine, thing, adrenaline epinephrine, good
combating infection. just not discussed enough. So,
discussing here. relates particular tool many ask about,
don't often get opportunity talk appropriate context. not
ever inappropriate talk about, talk now use of,
again, respiration breathing somewhat artificially activate stress response.
will accomplish two things. Okay? return medium long-term stress,
want say short-term stress good dilation pupils, changes
optics eyes, quickening heart rate, sharpening cognition.
fact short-term stress brings certain elements brain online allow


focus. Now, narrows focus. not good seeing so-called big
picture, narrows focus. allows these, call duration path
outcome types analysis. allows evaluate environment, evaluate
need do. primes whole system better cognition. primes immune
system combat infection. makes sense think fact
famine, thirst, bacterial infections, viral infections, invaders, stuff liberates
response body designed get fight back whatever stressor
happens be. Psychological, physical, bacterial, viral. Again, stress response
generic.

00:45:32 Adrenalin (Epinephrine) Deploys Killer Immune Cells

tool takes advantage fact adrenaline released body
adrenals, effect also liberating lot killer cells immune
organs, particular spleen, elsewhere well, interactions
lymphatic system combat infection. way works real world best
captured study can mapped back so-called Wim Hof breathing. Now,
Wim Hof breathing named so-called "Iceman," Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
course, Dutch. He, think self-titled Daredevil. indeed
many, many Guinness Book World Records things like swimming icebergs
going Kilimanjaro shorts crossing desert without water, et cetera.
Things quite dangerous don't know doing. Wim obviously
survived telling survived. two components sort
breathing protocol

00:46:40 Cyclic Deep Breathing Stress: Wim Hof, Tummo & Super-Oxygenation

developed based also called Tummo breathing, T-U-M-M-O.
So, Wim, Tummo breathing. many people call now super
oxygenation breathing. Although breath work aficionados will probably say, well,
not super oxygenation also blowing awful lot carbon dioxide.
talking here, regardless whether not called Wim Hof, Tummo, super
oxygenation, rapid deliberate breathing. So, deliberate hyperventilation.
somebody want this? Well, deliberate hyperventilation done maybe 25 cycles.


inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. Typically, done nose
mouth. Although sometimes just mouth.
15 breaths, 20 breaths, 25 breaths, will feel alert. People anxiety will
feel anxious. might even anxiety attack. However, need ask
kind breathing feels way. pattern breathing, rapid
movements diaphragm will liberate adrenaline adrenals. So,
release adrenaline. mentioned Wim also called "The Iceman." Well,
actually discovered pattern breathing, somewhat. again, maps
back Tummo breathing going cold water. go cold water,
stressor liberate adrenaline response cold water. So, get
ice bath cold shower, will immediately release adrenaline adrenals.
Now, sorts things related psychological control stress
thresholds talk about, really want people understand
adrenaline released body, better position combat infections.
so, whether not breathe quickly cycles 25 breaths regardless
call it, doesn't matter, adrenaline released. take cold shower,
adrenaline released. go ice bath deliberately, even non-
deliberately, adrenaline released. mimicking stress response.
adrenaline serves suppress combat incoming infections. beautifully
shown study published fine journal, "Proceedings
National Academy Sciences US." literally called "Proceedings
National Academy USA" distinguish proceedings national
academies countries. way experiment went people injected
endotoxin cases injected bacterial wall mimics
infection. gives fever. makes feel nauseous. makes feel sick.
not pleasant. Half people particular pattern breathing looked
much like pattern breathing described moment ago 25 deep inhales
exhales followed exhale holding breath. repeating 25 inhales,
exhales holding breath. So, look something like this, listening,
sounds like [inhaling exhaling]. 25, 30 times, start feeling heated up.
start feeling adrenaline response. liberating adrenaline body.
exhale, hold breath 15 seconds repeat. typically,
three four rounds that, inhale deeply hold breath. Now,
want emphasize never ever, ever anywhere near water. People passed


out. So-called shallow water blackout. People died. Don't bathtub. Don't
hot tub. Don't swimming. Please don't anywhere near water.
Please don't all, unless get clearance doctor
pulmonary effects whatnot. breath holds definitely not
done anyone glaucoma pressure concerns eyes. repeated
cycles breathing liberate adrenaline allowed group protocol
essentially experience zero symptoms ejection E. coli,
remarkable. much reduced no symptoms. didn't feel feverish.
didn't feel sick. weren't vomiting, no diarrhea, remarkable, makes total
sense think fact short-term stress response there,
typically called acute stress response,

00:50:58 Inflammation Useful Good, Short Term

designed combat stressors. fact, cut deeply
hike woods, thing happen
rapid inflammation response. always hear inflammation bad. Inflammation
gives us Alzheimer's. Inflammation worst thing. swelling associated,
inflammation associated recruitment things like macrophages microglia
neural tissue. Cells brain body whose job act like little ambulances
rush site clean up. indeed inflammation response looks
horrible, sounds horrible, great thing short-term. want
tissue marked trouble want body brain react it. So,
getting peaks stress time time throughout day throughout week,
better position combat infection. better position heal
wounds, physical wounds. Many great things happen stress response. Now,
course, stress response

00:52:02 Procrastination Self-Manufactured Nootropics

isn't always super intense. Sometimes milder. Sometimes allows us just focus
something deadline. can feel stressful, one
reasons procrastinators there, people always asking can done
procrastination? can done procrastination can understand


happening, self-imposing stress stress acts like drug.
powerful nootropic. get asked nootropics. powerful nootropic
smart drug stress. concern failure. desire well.
impending deadline. the, "Oh gosh, thing now going
fail." best nootropic will ever find. combined good night's
sleep, talk about. spent whole month sleep. So, don't want
backtrack much. Okay. So, short-term stress, great. key able turn
stress response off done, don't want that.

00:53:00 Relaxation Can Causes Illness

fact, just really tamp relationship short-term acute stress
response infection. Many us familiar experience work, work, work,
work, work, taking care loved one, stress, stress, stress, stress, finally
relax. Maybe even go vacation. Like, "Oh, now finally going get break."
get sick. adrenaline response crashed
immune system crashed it. So, please understand this. Now, many might
say, "Well, long? two hours? three hours?" lot really
like specificity, will vary everybody. just kind use rule thumb.
no longer able achieve good sleep, good sleep means you,
please see episodes sleep want tools sleep,
no longer able achieve good sleep, now moving acute stress chronic
stress. need able turn stress response off. one wish, well,
many wishes lifetime, one wish today hope will permeate
spread there, idea need young age, even adults
forever, need learn turn off stress response. Physiological sigh one.
going activate stress response intentionally ice baths, cold showers,
cyclic hyperoxygenated breathing, aka Tummo breathing Wim Hof breathing, also
need learn press brake. Okay? So, think stress system.
knows activate itself.

00:54:30 Immune Activation Protocol

Now talking way deliberately activating stress system order


combat infection. time time. might feel tickle throat like
getting kind run down, will kind breathing. do. will take 25 30 breaths.
Exhale, hold breath. 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold breath 15
seconds. 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold breath 25 30 seconds. big
inhale. hold breath feel impulse breathe. Again, feel safe
me. run doctor, fine. not unless right you.
this. people like ice bath. rarely ice bath. people like
cold showers. like hot showers. So, take hot showers, kind breathing.
Again, less effect

00:55:20 Medium Term Stress: Clear Definition

increasing adrenaline, allows combat infection
activating immune response. Okay. So, now talk medium-term stress.
Medium-term stress going stress lasts anywhere several days

01:06:30 Tools Dealing Long Term Stress

years end. best tools, best mechanisms know modulate long-
term stress might surprise little bit. First all, going things
don't surprise you, everyone knows getting regular exercise, getting good sleep,
using real-time tools try tamp stress response, et cetera, going
really useful. data really points fact social connection certain


types social connection particular going mitigate reduce long-
term stress. particularly important issue nowadays
proxies surrogates social connection. online texting people lot,
can feel connected. Like plane's take off everyone's texting
whether not fear flying not. like, "Okay, see you. Love
you. Hate you." Whatever trying communicate people. plane
lands, every phone's out, "See you. Love you. Hate you." hope fewer hate yous.
everyone kind need stay connected one another. Humans
incredibly social creatures. Now, way look whole business social
connection, not just kind wishy-washy new agey perspective. want
point sometimes say wishy-washy new agey. nothing that.
just, goal always put scientific data neurochemistry things
wishy-washy new agey stuff, also can arm
arguments members family life maybe
aren't tuned typical language around practices like, "Oh, connection
really key. get oxytocin."

01:08:20 Oxytocin Myth

Actually, know connection individuals rarely causes release
oxytocin? Oxytocin released particular circumstances like post-orgasm, baby
mother milk let down. associated kind really intense kinds pair bonding
things mother child. Also father child, especially mother child,
relationship lactation system. Couples post-sex. kinds things
reflect deep kind layers biology. oxytocin not just released
walk pat dog head see somebody give hug and,
"Hi, great see you," fist bump. not situation oxytocin. way think
social connection can mitigate long-term effects stress
really systems neuromodulation

01:09:15 Serotonin: Satiety, Safety

like serotonin, blocking certain things really bad us feel
socially isolated. Things like Taqi Kynan. So, let explain are. Serotonin


again, neuromodulator. Neuromodulators little bit like playlists brain.

brain tends go direction interpreting situation bad one. So,
discussion around emotions far nuanced elaborate this,
one way think relationship emotions whether not internal state

00:14:31 Stress RESPONSE: Generic, Channels blood, Biases Action

evolving tools. laboratories well. So,
talk stress response. that, will understand exactly
tools going give work. saying, "Wait, just want
tools. Just give summary," trust me, understand mechanism, going
far better position incorporate tools, teach tools others,
modify life circumstances change. like cheat sheet
just want one-page PDF, eventually get stuff people, really
important understand underlying mechanism. Okay. So, stress? Well,
just distinguish stressors, things stress us out, stress,
psychological physiological response stressors. mainly going
talk stress, response things. clear already
know, stressors can psychological can physical. Okay?
put outside cold day without jacket long time, stressful.
prepare many exams can't balance
sleep schedule needs comfort wellbeing, like food, rest, sleep,
social connection, stressful. So, stress, mentioned before, generic.


doesn't distinguish physical emotional stress. So, happens
stress response hits? talk immediate call acute stress
response. also think short-term stress. So, collection
neurons. name. called sympathetic chain ganglia. nothing
sympathy. Sympa means together. group neurons start
right neck run navel, little bit lower,
called sympathetic chain ganglia. don't need memorize name.
will not quiz. important know middle body,
chain neurons something stresses us out, either mind
something enters environment see something stresses us out,
don't like heights afraid heights, somebody dislike walks room, et
cetera, chain neurons becomes activated like bunch dominoes falling
once. fast. happens, neurons release neuromodulator
neurochemical talked podcast called acetylcholine.
release various sites within body. Now, important normally,
acetylcholine used move muscles. Actually, every time move muscle,
pick cup coffee, write pen, walk street, spinal neurons
connecting muscle releasing acetylcholine. So, brain involved focus
muscles involved making muscles twitch. stressed,
wouldn't want muscles contract just kind like
paralyzed like tonic activation, called. wouldn't want that.
Something called tetanus, believe not. tetanus toxin will cause kind
rigor entire body. not want that. neurons activated,
acetylcholine released, neurons aficionados there.
called postganglionic neurons. ones respond acetylcholine
release epinephrine, equivalent adrenaline. So,
system fast whenever stressed, core body,
neurons middle body release chemicals
adrenaline epinephrine released particular organs acts particular ways.
going weeds here. just stay going make
lot sense will appreciate knowledge hand. epinephrine
acts two different ways. things like muscles legs heart
things need active stressed, certain kind
receptor called beta receptor. beta receptor responds


epinephrine blood vessels dilate. get bigger blood rushes legs.
heart rate speeds up. Lots things happen get activated.
time, epinephrine activates receptors certain tissues don't need.
ones involved digestion, reproduction, things sort luxuries
things going well, not things pay attention stressed.
binds receptors contract blood vessels. So, basically stress
response, key phrase here, stress response A, generic, said
before, B, basically pushes certain systems activated systems
not activated. So, stress response two-pronged. yes certain things
no, may not right now things. So, key thing understand
stress response. heart speeds up. feel blood
certain organs tissues body, not others. throat goes
dry turns get stressed, salivary glands shut down.
lot less blood flow neurons control salivation. so, going
start swallowing. feel like throat getting dry. lot different
effects. not going list off, basically, activated ways
support moving. So, third thing. first all, generic. Second all,
stress response, activate certain things shuts features body.
sense agitation makes want move.
fundamentally, stress response just generic thing says something.
movement case can either bias move terms action, can
bias say something. stressed, likely say something
probably shouldn't say. likely move. trying suppress
movement, feel tremor. going feel agitated
designed move you. So, important want control stress,
need learn work agitation.

00:21:08 Tools Actually Control Stress: Reduce Alertness Increase Calm

like give tool point, think go lot
science, people going begin wonder just going kind standard
university lecture stress response. going give signs

use framework thinking one might reduce even eliminate


stress response quickly real time, arise don't want it. So,
taking podium sitting Zoom call, sudden feeling
flushed. feeling like heart racing. feeling little alert. feeling
little worked want calm down. far aware of, best tools
reduce stress quickly, so-called real-time tools going tools direct
line so-called autonomic nervous system. autonomic nervous system
name given kind general features alertness calmness body.
Typically, means automatic. Although control certain
so-called leavers entry points. doesn't work control stress. Telling
calm down. fact, tends just exacerbate stress. Telling someone else
calm also tends exacerbate stress. want reduce magnitude
stress response, best thing can activate system body
designed calming relaxation. system called
parasympathetic nervous system. mentioned before, neurons
control stress run neck navel. parasympathetic neurons,
para just means near, exist in, cranial nerves. So, kind left
neck lower brainstem. Kind back brain neck pelvic
area. parasympathetic nervous system really interesting especially
cranial nerves, ones brainstem neck area,
direct line various features face, particular, eyes. control
things like eye movements, pupil dilation, things sort, well tongue,
facial muscles, et cetera. parasympathetic nervous system, many people don't
realize this, system control face eyes,
extent, airway, trachea. neurons reside within pelvic area.
Now, neurons within pelvic area involved control genitals,
bladder, rectum. don't direct line. don't direct way
control those. actually go brain spinal cord
organs. Whereas parasympathetic nervous system certain entry points
call leavers will allow push back stress response real time
diminish feel relaxed really quickly. So, going teach first tool

00:29:45 Fastlane Calm

kind unique way, kind twist, physiological sigh.


physiological sigh discovered '30s. now explored neuro-
biological level mechanistically far detail Jack Feldman's lab UCLA.
Also Mark Krasnow's lab Stanford. physiological sigh something
humans animals anytime fall asleep. also throughout
sleep time time carbon dioxide, talk moment, builds
much system. physiological sigh something people
naturally start crying trying recover air
calm sobbing hard claustrophobic
environments. However, amazing thing thing call diaphragm,
skeletal muscle, internal organ can control voluntarily, unlike
spleen heart pancreas can't just say, "Oh, want make
pancreas turn little insulin right now. just going mind
directly." can't that. can smelling really good donut
something, can't just directly. can move diaphragm intentionally,
right? can anytime want. it'll run background not
thinking it. So, incredible pathway goes brain diaphragm
called phrenic nerve, P-H-R-E-N-I-C. Phrenic. phrenic nerve innervates
diaphragm. can control anytime want. can double inhales
triple inhales. can exhale inhales. Whatever want do.
incredible organ. physiological sigh something
spontaneously. feeling stressed, can double inhale, [inhales
deeply] [exhales] long exhale. Now, just told minute ago inhale
exhale, going speed heart rate up, promote
stress activation. Now telling double inhale-exhale order calm
down. reason double inhale-exhale physiological sigh takes
advantage fact double inhale, even second inhale
sneaking just tiny bit air, kind hard get deep inhales back
back, big deep inhale another little ones sneaking in, little sacks
lungs. lungs. lungs just two big bags, got
millions little sacks throughout lungs actually make surface area
lungs big tennis court. amazing just spread out. tend
collapse get stressed. carbon dioxide builds bloodstream
one reasons feel agitated well. So, makes us jittery. mean,
effects carbon dioxide don't want get into,


double inhale-exhale, double inhale reinflates little sacks lungs.
long exhale, long exhale now much effective
reading body bloodstream carbon dioxide, relaxes quickly.
lab collaboration David Spiegel's lab, David's Associate Chair
Psychiatry Stanford, study right now exploring physiological sighs
patterns breathing done deliberately can modulate stress response
things related emotionality. work ongoing. want clear
studies aren't done. clear work labs, work Jack
Feldman's lab others, physiological sigh fastest, hardwired way us

give tool think people heard mindfulness
meditation good, exercise good us, need getting enough sleep, et
cetera, life happens. find position
alert activated like be, regardless whether not stressor
relationship-based financial physical anything like that, can look
physiological sigh bypasses important feature function,
hard control mind mind, especially
heightened states activation. alert sleepy, hard
use so-called top-down mechanisms intention gratitude things
really powerful tools not super activated stressed not super
tired. anywhere range alert stressed sleepy,
physiological sighs powerful way bringing level so-called autonomic

line bank whether not wearing mask nowadays not,
whatever conditions may needs, feeling
stressed, physiological sigh done just one three times, will double inhale,
exhale, double inhale, exhale maybe just two times will bring level stress
very, fast.

00:34:53 Important Notes Heart Rate Deceleration: Vaso-vagal Lag

far know, fastest way accomplish that. important note
physiological sigh exhale-emphasized breathing lowering stress response.
Many people worry heart rate not come fast enough. want tell


not want heart rate reduce fast. actually something
called vasovagal response, people will stand get middle
night use bathroom sudden, collapse, faint.
heart rate reduced much. people will see blood
see something really troubling stressful pass out. over-
activation acceleration calming response. not stressed
kind fall off cliff stress. get stressed rebound mechanism
calming goes high, fast. calmed fast
collapse faint. so, aware going use physiological sigh
exhale-emphasized breathing calm down, heart rate will take 20 30
seconds come baseline. may need repeat physiological sigh
times. So, important note use breathing control levels
stress. thing decide look body control mind,
something else powerful. stressed mind body,
feeling really agitated, activated, worried, use tool like
physiological sigh exhale-emphasized breathing, will notice brain
mind becomes available controlling stress response reacting
it. great sweet spot life be, provided not trying
sleep, alert calm. so, idea. alert calm

00:36:50 Cyclic Sighing Calm Sleep Induction

bring back sort plane alertness.
trouble sleeping just relaxing day, physiological sigh can repeated
10, 15 cycles like. people find actually puts sleep. So,
lie reading many these, actually can put
sleep. find breath work protocols, kind stuff
done away real life, set aside time decide quote unquote,
breath work, works inhales longer
vigorous exhales, tends activating alert you.
exhales longer vigorous inhales, tends put sleep.
many protocols laboratories populate
internet wellness sites whatnot, exhale-emphasized breathing, oftentimes
used tool trying teach people fall asleep. Physiological sigh


little different. designed used real time. Just think just kind kit
things can life happens need react life. note
nasal versus mouth breathing, plethora information now

00:37:57 Nasal Breathing Cosmetic, Immune Performance Enhancement

James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science Lost Art," came
last year. Excellent book. well "Jaws" Sandra Kahn, Paul
Ehrlich foreword Jared Diamond Robert Sapolsky. So, collection
people Stanford. Jared Diamond not Stanford, rest are.
heavy hitters book, benefits nasal breathing. many
cases, nasal breathing advantageous mouth breathing sorts
things. Cosmetic features face, especially kids, warding off infection, et cetera.
physiological sigh, best way double inhale
nose, exhale mouth. can't, can
mouth, just mouth. want nose,
nose. anchors back underlying neurology neuroscience.

00:38:46 Two Breathing Centers Brain

So, want know, two breathing centers. One
involved rhythmic breathing inhales followed exhales, followed inhales
followed exhales. so-called pre-Botzinger nucleus named bottle wine
discovered Jack Feldman UCLA nearby nucleus called parafacial
nucleus also discovered Jack Feldman UCLA. parafacial nucleus
involved time double inhales double exhales. designed
breathe speaking can't always go inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale speaking. So, tell this, not overwhelm
knowledge, just know double inhales double
exhales, activating parafacial nucleus. cool effects.
located near neurons control face, also tendency
relax jaw. interplay neurons control speaking stuff
stuff tongue. So, sudden, physiological sigh,
tap neural circuitry allows us



00:39:45 Breathing Speaking Clearly

speak clearly, control muscles face jaw. Maybe means not
saying certain things stressed, just generally relax. so, brings
us back neuroscience parasympathetic nervous system. calming
system genetically encoded us have, regardless
parents are, neurons control stuff, face, eyes, et
cetera, working together. get stressed, hard us
speak tend jitter kinds things. Just like neurons cause
stress center spinal cord working together get body activated.
Okay, lot science today. now got physiological sigh tool. know
exhale-emphasized breathing will slow heart inhale-emphasized
breathing will speed heart up. So, think something now.

00:40:39 3 Types Stress: Short, Medium Long-Term

think stress not whether not acute chronic, whether not
good us bad us, three different timescales. can arrive
relates emotions. trust me, everything
emotions whether not functioning well emotionally not
functioning well emotionally, whether not coping not coping. So,
typically psychological terms psychological discussions. entering
portal physiology. stuff medical textbooks. will arrive
psychology soon, really want understand difference three
kinds stress three different timescales, short-term, medium-term, long-term,
good bad for. think heard stress bad
us. seen pictures intended frighten us. indeed frightening.
see nice really plump brain left. says healthy control.
see brain says stressed right like withered, see
hippocampus area involved memory smaller. People stressed.
see Alzheimer's brain made worse stress. people
predisposition schizophrenia, get stressed, higher incidence
schizophrenia episodes. hear addicts will relapse stressed.


mean, okay, get it. important, think heard now many
times stress bad.

00:42:10 Positive Effects Short-Term Stress: Immunity Focus

conversation, unfortunately, eclipsed really positive things
stress us short-term. So, stress can short-term, medium-term, long-
term. Long-term stress indeed bad reasons just mentioned many
others. never actually discussed stress terrific for, positive
short-term. think tend overlook important question,
short-term long-term? No one ever bothers tell us chronic,
acute. Right? five minutes? five days? duration final
exams? duration senior thesis college? No one actually draws
boundaries around stuff even general guidelines. so, become bit
mess, frankly, try decipher whole space around stress. So, going try
clean based know scientific data. First
all, acute stress, stress response hits, good immune system.
know might tough pill swallow, absolutely true. fact, stress often
comes form bacterial viral infection. stress response part
organized combat bacterial viral infection. pathways
brain centers activate neurons spinal cord make feel like
want move. neurons brain activate things like spleen,
will deploy killer cells go scavenge incoming bacteria viruses
try eat kill them. So, short-term stress release
adrenaline particular epinephrine, thing, adrenaline epinephrine, good
combating infection. just not discussed enough. So,
discussing here. relates particular tool many ask about,
don't often get opportunity talk appropriate context. not
ever inappropriate talk about, talk now use of,
again, respiration breathing somewhat artificially activate stress response.
will accomplish two things. Okay? return medium long-term stress,
want say short-term stress good dilation pupils, changes
optics eyes, quickening heart rate, sharpening cognition.
fact short-term stress brings certain elements brain online allow


focus. Now, narrows focus. not good seeing so-called big
picture, narrows focus. allows these, call duration path
outcome types analysis. allows evaluate environment, evaluate
need do. primes whole system better cognition. primes immune
system combat infection. makes sense think fact
famine, thirst, bacterial infections, viral infections, invaders, stuff liberates
response body designed get fight back whatever stressor
happens be. Psychological, physical, bacterial, viral. Again, stress response
generic.

00:45:32 Adrenalin (Epinephrine) Deploys Killer Immune Cells

organs, particular spleen, elsewhere well, interactions
lymphatic system combat infection. way works real world best
captured study can mapped back so-called Wim Hof breathing. Now,
Wim Hof breathing named so-called "Iceman," Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
course, Dutch. He, think self-titled Daredevil. indeed
many, many Guinness Book World Records things like swimming icebergs
going Kilimanjaro shorts crossing desert without water, et cetera.
Things quite dangerous don't know doing. Wim obviously
survived telling survived. two components sort
breathing protocol

00:46:40 Cyclic Deep Breathing Stress: Wim Hof, Tummo & Super-Oxygenation

developed based also called Tummo breathing, T-U-M-M-O.
So, Wim, Tummo breathing. many people call now super
oxygenation breathing. Although breath work aficionados will probably say, well,
not super oxygenation also blowing awful lot carbon dioxide.
talking here, regardless whether not called Wim Hof, Tummo, super
oxygenation, rapid deliberate breathing. So, deliberate hyperventilation.
somebody want this? Well, deliberate hyperventilation done maybe 25 cycles.


inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. Typically, done nose
mouth. Although sometimes just mouth.
15 breaths, 20 breaths, 25 breaths, will feel alert. People anxiety will
feel anxious. might even anxiety attack. However, need ask
kind breathing feels way. pattern breathing, rapid
movements diaphragm will liberate adrenaline adrenals. So,
release adrenaline. mentioned Wim also called "The Iceman." Well,
actually discovered pattern breathing, somewhat. again, maps
back Tummo breathing going cold water. go cold water,
stressor liberate adrenaline response cold water. So, get
ice bath cold shower, will immediately release adrenaline adrenals.
Now, sorts things related psychological control stress
thresholds talk about, really want people understand
adrenaline released body, better position combat infections.
so, whether not breathe quickly cycles 25 breaths regardless
call it, doesn't matter, adrenaline released. take cold shower,
adrenaline released. go ice bath deliberately, even non-
deliberately, adrenaline released. mimicking stress response.
adrenaline serves suppress combat incoming infections. beautifully
shown study published fine journal, "Proceedings
National Academy Sciences US." literally called "Proceedings
National Academy USA" distinguish proceedings national
academies countries. way experiment went people injected
endotoxin cases injected bacterial wall mimics
infection. gives fever. makes feel nauseous. makes feel sick.
not pleasant. Half people particular pattern breathing looked
much like pattern breathing described moment ago 25 deep inhales
exhales followed exhale holding breath. repeating 25 inhales,
exhales holding breath. So, look something like this, listening,
sounds like [inhaling exhaling]. 25, 30 times, start feeling heated up.
start feeling adrenaline response. liberating adrenaline body.
exhale, hold breath 15 seconds repeat. typically,
three four rounds that, inhale deeply hold breath. Now,
want emphasize never ever, ever anywhere near water. People passed


out. So-called shallow water blackout. People died. Don't bathtub. Don't
hot tub. Don't swimming. Please don't anywhere near water.
Please don't all, unless get clearance doctor
pulmonary effects whatnot. breath holds definitely not

cycles breathing liberate adrenaline allowed group protocol
essentially experience zero symptoms ejection E. coli,
remarkable. much reduced no symptoms. didn't feel feverish.
didn't feel sick. weren't vomiting, no diarrhea, remarkable, makes total
sense think fact short-term stress response there,
typically called acute stress response,

00:50:58 Inflammation Useful Good, Short Term

designed combat stressors. fact, cut deeply
hike woods, thing happen
rapid inflammation response. always hear inflammation bad. Inflammation
gives us Alzheimer's. Inflammation worst thing. swelling associated,
inflammation associated recruitment things like macrophages microglia
neural tissue. Cells brain body whose job act like little ambulances
rush site clean up. indeed inflammation response looks
horrible, sounds horrible, great thing short-term. want
tissue marked trouble want body brain react it. So,
getting peaks stress time time throughout day throughout week,
better position combat infection. better position heal
wounds, physical wounds. Many great things happen stress response. Now,
course, stress response

00:52:02 Procrastination Self-Manufactured Nootropics

backtrack much. Okay. So, short-term stress, great. key able turn
stress response off done, don't want that.

00:53:00 Relaxation Can Causes Illness

fact, just really tamp relationship short-term acute stress
response infection. Many us familiar experience work, work, work,
work, work, taking care loved one, stress, stress, stress, stress, finally
relax. Maybe even go vacation. Like, "Oh, now finally going get break."
get sick. adrenaline response crashed
immune system crashed it. So, please understand this. Now, many might
say, "Well, long? two hours? three hours?" lot really

00:54:30 Immune Activation Protocol

Now talking way deliberately activating stress system order


combat infection. time time. might feel tickle throat like

Exhale, hold breath. 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold breath 15

inhale. hold breath feel impulse breathe. Again, feel safe

this. people like ice bath. rarely ice bath. people like
cold showers. like hot showers. So, take hot showers, kind breathing.
Again, less effect

00:55:20 Medium Term Stress: Clear Definition

Medium-term stress going stress lasts anywhere several days

01:06:30 Tools Dealing Long Term Stress

years end. best tools, best mechanisms know modulate long-
term stress might surprise little bit. First all, going things
don't surprise you, everyone knows getting regular exercise, getting good sleep,
using real-time tools try tamp stress response, et cetera, going
really useful. data really points fact social connection certain


types social connection particular going mitigate reduce long-
term stress. particularly important issue nowadays
proxies surrogates social connection. online texting people lot,
can feel connected. Like plane's take off everyone's texting
whether not fear flying not. like, "Okay, see you. Love
you. Hate you." Whatever trying communicate people. plane
lands, every phone's out, "See you. Love you. Hate you." hope fewer hate yous.
everyone kind need stay connected one another. Humans
incredibly social creatures. Now, way look whole business social
connection, not just kind wishy-washy new agey perspective. want

just, goal always put scientific data neurochemistry things
wishy-washy new agey stuff, also can arm
arguments members family life maybe

really key. get oxytocin."

01:08:20 Oxytocin Myth

Actually, know connection individuals rarely causes release
oxytocin? Oxytocin released particular circumstances like post-orgasm, baby
mother milk let down. associated kind really intense kinds pair bonding
things mother child. Also father child, especially mother child,
relationship lactation system. Couples post-sex. kinds things
reflect deep kind layers biology. oxytocin not just released

"Hi, great see you," fist bump. not situation oxytocin. way think
social connection can mitigate long-term effects stress
really systems neuromodulation

01:09:15 Serotonin: Satiety, Safety

like serotonin, blocking certain things really bad us feel

acetylcholine used move muscles. Actually, every time move muscle,
pick cup coffee, write pen, walk street, spinal neurons
connecting muscle releasing acetylcholine. So, brain involved focus
muscles involved making muscles twitch. stressed,

things going well, not things pay attention stressed.
binds receptors contract blood vessels. So, basically stress
response, key phrase here, stress response A, generic, said
before, B, basically pushes certain systems activated systems
not activated. So, stress response two-pronged. yes certain things
no, may not right now things. So, key thing understand
stress response. heart speeds up. feel blood
certain organs tissues body, not others. throat goes
dry turns get stressed, salivary glands shut down.
lot less blood flow neurons control salivation. so, going
start swallowing. feel like throat getting dry. lot different

stress response, activate certain things shuts features body.
sense agitation makes want move.
fundamentally, stress response just generic thing says something.
movement case can either bias move terms action, can
bias say something. stressed, likely say something
probably shouldn't say. likely move. trying suppress
movement, feel tremor. going feel agitated
designed move you. So, important want control stress,
need learn work agitation.

00:21:08 Tools Actually Control Stress: Reduce Alertness Increase Calm

Now, neurons within pelvic area involved control genitals,

00:29:45 Fastlane Calm

kind unique way, kind twist, physiological sigh.


physiological sigh discovered '30s. now explored neuro-
biological level mechanistically far detail Jack Feldman's lab UCLA.
Also Mark Krasnow's lab Stanford. physiological sigh something
humans animals anytime fall asleep. also throughout
sleep time time carbon dioxide, talk moment, builds
much system. physiological sigh something people
naturally start crying trying recover air
calm sobbing hard claustrophobic
environments. However, amazing thing thing call diaphragm,
skeletal muscle, internal organ can control voluntarily, unlike
spleen heart pancreas can't just say, "Oh, want make
pancreas turn little insulin right now. just going mind
directly." can't that. can smelling really good donut
something, can't just directly. can move diaphragm intentionally,
right? can anytime want. it'll run background not
thinking it. So, incredible pathway goes brain diaphragm
called phrenic nerve, P-H-R-E-N-I-C. Phrenic. phrenic nerve innervates
diaphragm. can control anytime want. can double inhales
triple inhales. can exhale inhales. Whatever want do.
incredible organ. physiological sigh something
spontaneously. feeling stressed, can double inhale, [inhales
deeply] [exhales] long exhale. Now, just told minute ago inhale
exhale, going speed heart rate up, promote
stress activation. Now telling double inhale-exhale order calm
down. reason double inhale-exhale physiological sigh takes
advantage fact double inhale, even second inhale
sneaking just tiny bit air, kind hard get deep inhales back
back, big deep inhale another little ones sneaking in, little sacks
lungs. lungs. lungs just two big bags, got
millions little sacks throughout lungs actually make surface area
lungs big tennis court. amazing just spread out. tend
collapse get stressed. carbon dioxide builds bloodstream
one reasons feel agitated well. So, makes us jittery. mean,
effects carbon dioxide don't want get into,


double inhale-exhale, double inhale reinflates little sacks lungs.
long exhale, long exhale now much effective
reading body bloodstream carbon dioxide, relaxes quickly.
lab collaboration David Spiegel's lab, David's Associate Chair
Psychiatry Stanford, study right now exploring physiological sighs
patterns breathing done deliberately can modulate stress response
things related emotionality. work ongoing. want clear
studies aren't done. clear work labs, work Jack
Feldman's lab others, physiological sigh fastest, hardwired way us
eliminate stressful response body quickly real time. so, excited
give tool think people heard mindfulness
meditation good, exercise good us, need getting enough sleep, et
cetera, life happens. find position
alert activated like be, regardless whether not stressor
relationship-based financial physical anything like that, can look
physiological sigh bypasses important feature function,
hard control mind mind, especially
heightened states activation. alert sleepy, hard
use so-called top-down mechanisms intention gratitude things
really powerful tools not super activated stressed not super
tired. anywhere range alert stressed sleepy,
physiological sighs powerful way bringing level so-called autonomic
activation, just means level alertness down. so, whether not
line bank whether not wearing mask nowadays not,
whatever conditions may needs, feeling
stressed, physiological sigh done just one three times, will double inhale,
exhale, double inhale, exhale maybe just two times will bring level stress
very, fast.

00:34:53 Important Notes Heart Rate Deceleration: Vaso-vagal Lag

far know, fastest way accomplish that. important note
physiological sigh exhale-emphasized breathing lowering stress response.
Many people worry heart rate not come fast enough. want tell


not want heart rate reduce fast. actually something
called vasovagal response, people will stand get middle
night use bathroom sudden, collapse, faint.
heart rate reduced much. people will see blood
see something really troubling stressful pass out. over-
activation acceleration calming response. not stressed
kind fall off cliff stress. get stressed rebound mechanism
calming goes high, fast. calmed fast
collapse faint. so, aware going use physiological sigh
exhale-emphasized breathing calm down, heart rate will take 20 30
seconds come baseline. may need repeat physiological sigh
times. So, important note use breathing control levels
stress. thing decide look body control mind,
something else powerful. stressed mind body,
feeling really agitated, activated, worried, use tool like
physiological sigh exhale-emphasized breathing, will notice brain
mind becomes available controlling stress response reacting
it. great sweet spot life be, provided not trying
sleep, alert calm. so, idea. alert calm

00:36:50 Cyclic Sighing Calm Sleep Induction

bring back sort plane alertness.
trouble sleeping just relaxing day, physiological sigh can repeated
10, 15 cycles like. people find actually puts sleep. So,
lie reading many these, actually can put
sleep. find breath work protocols, kind stuff
done away real life, set aside time decide quote unquote,
breath work, works inhales longer
vigorous exhales, tends activating alert you.
exhales longer vigorous inhales, tends put sleep.
many protocols laboratories populate
internet wellness sites whatnot, exhale-emphasized breathing, oftentimes
used tool trying teach people fall asleep. Physiological sigh


little different. designed used real time. Just think just kind kit
things can life happens need react life. note
nasal versus mouth breathing, plethora information now

00:37:57 Nasal Breathing Cosmetic, Immune Performance Enhancement

James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science Lost Art," came
last year. Excellent book. well "Jaws" Sandra Kahn, Paul
Ehrlich foreword Jared Diamond Robert Sapolsky. So, collection
people Stanford. Jared Diamond not Stanford, rest are.
heavy hitters book, benefits nasal breathing. many
cases, nasal breathing advantageous mouth breathing sorts
things. Cosmetic features face, especially kids, warding off infection, et cetera.
physiological sigh, best way double inhale
nose, exhale mouth. can't, can
mouth, just mouth. want nose,
nose. anchors back underlying neurology neuroscience.

00:38:46 Two Breathing Centers Brain

So, want know, two breathing centers. One
involved rhythmic breathing inhales followed exhales, followed inhales
followed exhales. so-called pre-Botzinger nucleus named bottle wine
discovered Jack Feldman UCLA nearby nucleus called parafacial
nucleus also discovered Jack Feldman UCLA. parafacial nucleus
involved time double inhales double exhales. designed
breathe speaking can't always go inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale speaking. So, tell this, not overwhelm
knowledge, just know double inhales double
exhales, activating parafacial nucleus. cool effects.
located near neurons control face, also tendency
relax jaw. interplay neurons control speaking stuff
stuff tongue. So, sudden, physiological sigh,
tap neural circuitry allows us



00:39:45 Breathing Speaking Clearly

speak clearly, control muscles face jaw. Maybe means not
saying certain things stressed, just generally relax. so, brings
us back neuroscience parasympathetic nervous system. calming
system genetically encoded us have, regardless
parents are, neurons control stuff, face, eyes, et
cetera, working together. get stressed, hard us
speak tend jitter kinds things. Just like neurons cause
stress center spinal cord working together get body activated.
Okay, lot science today. now got physiological sigh tool. know
exhale-emphasized breathing will slow heart inhale-emphasized
breathing will speed heart up. So, think something now.

00:40:39 3 Types Stress: Short, Medium Long-Term

think stress not whether not acute chronic, whether not
good us bad us, three different timescales. can arrive
relates emotions. trust me, everything
emotions whether not functioning well emotionally not
functioning well emotionally, whether not coping not coping. So,
typically psychological terms psychological discussions. entering
portal physiology. stuff medical textbooks. will arrive
psychology soon, really want understand difference three
kinds stress three different timescales, short-term, medium-term, long-term,
good bad for. think heard stress bad
us. seen pictures intended frighten us. indeed frightening.
see nice really plump brain left. says healthy control.
see brain says stressed right like withered, see
hippocampus area involved memory smaller. People stressed.
see Alzheimer's brain made worse stress. people
predisposition schizophrenia, get stressed, higher incidence
schizophrenia episodes. hear addicts will relapse stressed.


mean, okay, get it. important, think heard now many
times stress bad.

00:42:10 Positive Effects Short-Term Stress: Immunity Focus

conversation, unfortunately, eclipsed really positive things
stress us short-term. So, stress can short-term, medium-term, long-
term. Long-term stress indeed bad reasons just mentioned many
others. never actually discussed stress terrific for, positive
short-term. think tend overlook important question,
short-term long-term? No one ever bothers tell us chronic,
acute. Right? five minutes? five days? duration final
exams? duration senior thesis college? No one actually draws
boundaries around stuff even general guidelines. so, become bit
mess, frankly, try decipher whole space around stress. So, going try
clean based know scientific data. First
all, acute stress, stress response hits, good immune system.
know might tough pill swallow, absolutely true. fact, stress often
comes form bacterial viral infection. stress response part
organized combat bacterial viral infection. pathways
brain centers activate neurons spinal cord make feel like
want move. neurons brain activate things like spleen,
will deploy killer cells go scavenge incoming bacteria viruses
try eat kill them. So, short-term stress release
adrenaline particular epinephrine, thing, adrenaline epinephrine, good
combating infection. just not discussed enough. So,
discussing here. relates particular tool many ask about,
don't often get opportunity talk appropriate context. not
ever inappropriate talk about, talk now use of,
again, respiration breathing somewhat artificially activate stress response.
will accomplish two things. Okay? return medium long-term stress,
want say short-term stress good dilation pupils, changes
optics eyes, quickening heart rate, sharpening cognition.
fact short-term stress brings certain elements brain online allow


focus. Now, narrows focus. not good seeing so-called big
picture, narrows focus. allows these, call duration path
outcome types analysis. allows evaluate environment, evaluate
need do. primes whole system better cognition. primes immune
system combat infection. makes sense think fact
famine, thirst, bacterial infections, viral infections, invaders, stuff liberates
response body designed get fight back whatever stressor
happens be. Psychological, physical, bacterial, viral. Again, stress response
generic.

00:45:32 Adrenalin (Epinephrine) Deploys Killer Immune Cells

tool takes advantage fact adrenaline released body
adrenals, effect also liberating lot killer cells immune
organs, particular spleen, elsewhere well, interactions
lymphatic system combat infection. way works real world best
captured study can mapped back so-called Wim Hof breathing. Now,
Wim Hof breathing named so-called "Iceman," Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
course, Dutch. He, think self-titled Daredevil. indeed
many, many Guinness Book World Records things like swimming icebergs
going Kilimanjaro shorts crossing desert without water, et cetera.
Things quite dangerous don't know doing. Wim obviously
survived telling survived. two components sort
breathing protocol

00:46:40 Cyclic Deep Breathing Stress: Wim Hof, Tummo & Super-Oxygenation

developed based also called Tummo breathing, T-U-M-M-O.
So, Wim, Tummo breathing. many people call now super
oxygenation breathing. Although breath work aficionados will probably say, well,
not super oxygenation also blowing awful lot carbon dioxide.
talking here, regardless whether not called Wim Hof, Tummo, super
oxygenation, rapid deliberate breathing. So, deliberate hyperventilation.
somebody want this? Well, deliberate hyperventilation done maybe 25 cycles.


inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. Typically, done nose
mouth. Although sometimes just mouth.
15 breaths, 20 breaths, 25 breaths, will feel alert. People anxiety will
feel anxious. might even anxiety attack. However, need ask
kind breathing feels way. pattern breathing, rapid
movements diaphragm will liberate adrenaline adrenals. So,
release adrenaline. mentioned Wim also called "The Iceman." Well,
actually discovered pattern breathing, somewhat. again, maps
back Tummo breathing going cold water. go cold water,
stressor liberate adrenaline response cold water. So, get
ice bath cold shower, will immediately release adrenaline adrenals.
Now, sorts things related psychological control stress
thresholds talk about, really want people understand
adrenaline released body, better position combat infections.
so, whether not breathe quickly cycles 25 breaths regardless
call it, doesn't matter, adrenaline released. take cold shower,
adrenaline released. go ice bath deliberately, even non-
deliberately, adrenaline released. mimicking stress response.
adrenaline serves suppress combat incoming infections. beautifully
shown study published fine journal, "Proceedings
National Academy Sciences US." literally called "Proceedings
National Academy USA" distinguish proceedings national
academies countries. way experiment went people injected
endotoxin cases injected bacterial wall mimics
infection. gives fever. makes feel nauseous. makes feel sick.
not pleasant. Half people particular pattern breathing looked
much like pattern breathing described moment ago 25 deep inhales
exhales followed exhale holding breath. repeating 25 inhales,
exhales holding breath. So, look something like this, listening,
sounds like [inhaling exhaling]. 25, 30 times, start feeling heated up.
start feeling adrenaline response. liberating adrenaline body.
exhale, hold breath 15 seconds repeat. typically,
three four rounds that, inhale deeply hold breath. Now,
want emphasize never ever, ever anywhere near water. People passed


out. So-called shallow water blackout. People died. Don't bathtub. Don't
hot tub. Don't swimming. Please don't anywhere near water.
Please don't all, unless get clearance doctor
pulmonary effects whatnot. breath holds definitely not
done anyone glaucoma pressure concerns eyes. repeated
cycles breathing liberate adrenaline allowed group protocol
essentially experience zero symptoms ejection E. coli,
remarkable. much reduced no symptoms. didn't feel feverish.
didn't feel sick. weren't vomiting, no diarrhea, remarkable, makes total
sense think fact short-term stress response there,
typically called acute stress response,

00:50:58 Inflammation Useful Good, Short Term

designed combat stressors. fact, cut deeply
hike woods, thing happen
rapid inflammation response. always hear inflammation bad. Inflammation
gives us Alzheimer's. Inflammation worst thing. swelling associated,
inflammation associated recruitment things like macrophages microglia
neural tissue. Cells brain body whose job act like little ambulances
rush site clean up. indeed inflammation response looks
horrible, sounds horrible, great thing short-term. want
tissue marked trouble want body brain react it. So,
getting peaks stress time time throughout day throughout week,
better position combat infection. better position heal
wounds, physical wounds. Many great things happen stress response. Now,
course, stress response

00:52:02 Procrastination Self-Manufactured Nootropics

isn't always super intense. Sometimes milder. Sometimes allows us just focus
something deadline. can feel stressful, one
reasons procrastinators there, people always asking can done
procrastination? can done procrastination can understand


happening, self-imposing stress stress acts like drug.
powerful nootropic. get asked nootropics. powerful nootropic
smart drug stress. concern failure. desire well.
impending deadline. the, "Oh gosh, thing now going
fail." best nootropic will ever find. combined good night's
sleep, talk about. spent whole month sleep. So, don't want
backtrack much. Okay. So, short-term stress, great. key able turn
stress response off done, don't want that.

00:53:00 Relaxation Can Causes Illness

fact, just really tamp relationship short-term acute stress
response infection. Many us familiar experience work, work, work,
work, work, taking care loved one, stress, stress, stress, stress, finally
relax. Maybe even go vacation. Like, "Oh, now finally going get break."
get sick. adrenaline response crashed
immune system crashed it. So, please understand this. Now, many might
say, "Well, long? two hours? three hours?" lot really
like specificity, will vary everybody. just kind use rule thumb.
no longer able achieve good sleep, good sleep means you,
please see episodes sleep want tools sleep,
no longer able achieve good sleep, now moving acute stress chronic
stress. need able turn stress response off. one wish, well,
many wishes lifetime, one wish today hope will permeate
spread there, idea need young age, even adults
forever, need learn turn off stress response. Physiological sigh one.
going activate stress response intentionally ice baths, cold showers,
cyclic hyperoxygenated breathing, aka Tummo breathing Wim Hof breathing, also
need learn press brake. Okay? So, think stress system.
knows activate itself.

00:54:30 Immune Activation Protocol

Now talking way deliberately activating stress system order


combat infection. time time. might feel tickle throat like
getting kind run down, will kind breathing. do. will take 25 30 breaths.
Exhale, hold breath. 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold breath 15
seconds. 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold breath 25 30 seconds. big
inhale. hold breath feel impulse breathe. Again, feel safe
me. run doctor, fine. not unless right you.
this. people like ice bath. rarely ice bath. people like
cold showers. like hot showers. So, take hot showers, kind breathing.
Again, less effect

00:55:20 Medium Term Stress: Clear Definition

increasing adrenaline, allows combat infection
activating immune response. Okay. So, now talk medium-term stress.
Medium-term stress going stress lasts anywhere several days
several weeks. Okay. might think long-term stress. times life

01:06:30 Tools Dealing Long Term Stress

years end. best tools, best mechanisms know modulate long-
term stress might surprise little bit. First all, going things
don't surprise you, everyone knows getting regular exercise, getting good sleep,
using real-time tools try tamp stress response, et cetera, going
really useful. data really points fact social connection certain


types social connection particular going mitigate reduce long-
term stress. particularly important issue nowadays
proxies surrogates social connection. online texting people lot,
can feel connected. Like plane's take off everyone's texting
whether not fear flying not. like, "Okay, see you. Love
you. Hate you." Whatever trying communicate people. plane
lands, every phone's out, "See you. Love you. Hate you." hope fewer hate yous.
everyone kind need stay connected one another. Humans
incredibly social creatures. Now, way look whole business social
connection, not just kind wishy-washy new agey perspective. want
point sometimes say wishy-washy new agey. nothing that.
just, goal always put scientific data neurochemistry things
wishy-washy new agey stuff, also can arm
arguments members family life maybe
aren't tuned typical language around practices like, "Oh, connection
really key. get oxytocin."

01:08:20 Oxytocin Myth

Actually, know connection individuals rarely causes release
oxytocin? Oxytocin released particular circumstances like post-orgasm, baby
mother milk let down. associated kind really intense kinds pair bonding
things mother child. Also father child, especially mother child,
relationship lactation system. Couples post-sex. kinds things
reflect deep kind layers biology. oxytocin not just released
walk pat dog head see somebody give hug and,
"Hi, great see you," fist bump. not situation oxytocin. way think
social connection can mitigate long-term effects stress
really systems neuromodulation

01:09:15 Serotonin: Satiety, Safety

like serotonin, blocking certain things really bad us feel
socially isolated. Things like Taqi Kynan. So, let explain are. Serotonin


again, neuromodulator. Neuromodulators little bit like playlists brain.
tend amplify bias likelihood certain brain circuits body circuits
going activated others will not. Serotonin generally, realize
speaking generally here, generally gives us feelings wellbeing. high

seems less attached well. no scientific evidence
human-human attachment. attachments humans well.
can attachments people. can romantic attachments.
familial attachments non-romantic, friendship, pets, even
attachments things just delight us. One things really can mitigate
long-term negative effects chronic long-term stress isn't just fun.
hear stuff, "You need play fun." can little bit tough
concept, especially hard driving people people stressed,
sense delight, sense really enjoying something see engage in,

or, "Nobody wants engage socially anymore." first admit, social

01:19:15 Adrenal Burnout Myth… Need Know Anyway

point can become problematic. Now, note adrenal burnout.
actually no thing adrenal burnout normal conditions. adrenals
enough adrenaline support 200 years stress better, worse. concept
adrenal burnout origins work Nobel Prize winner, Hans Selye, actually
discovered called general adaptation syndrome. discovered lot
things stress. phenomenal work turned true.
stressors. something called distress. talked eustress,
positive stress. Eustress never really caught kind general
discussion. theory stress went long enough,
eventually reach phase called exhaustion. turned wrong. Although
many may feel exhausted chronic stress, isn't really physiological
exhaustion happens. eventually got picked ran general
public. talk adrenal burnout. much coffee, adrenal burnout. hear
stuff. no thing adrenal burnout. adrenals don't burn out.
something, however, called adrenal insufficiency syndrome, real
physiological problem people impaired adrenals can't
produce adrenaline. melatonin taken high levels periods time
long can cause suppression cortisol epinephrine released
adrenals can create kind pseudo adrenal insufficiency syndrome. So, aware
melatonin reason. Please, trying, alone can't get rid phrase adrenal

spontaneously. feeling stressed, can double inhale, [inhales
deeply] [exhales] long exhale. Now, just told minute ago inhale
exhale, going speed heart rate up, promote
stress activation. Now telling double inhale-exhale order calm
down. reason double inhale-exhale physiological sigh takes
advantage fact double inhale, even second inhale
sneaking just tiny bit air, kind hard get deep inhales back
back, big deep inhale another little ones sneaking in, little sacks
lungs. lungs. lungs just two big bags, got
millions little sacks throughout lungs actually make surface area
lungs big tennis court. amazing just spread out. tend
collapse get stressed. carbon dioxide builds bloodstream
one reasons feel agitated well. So, makes us jittery. mean,
effects carbon dioxide don't want get into,


double inhale-exhale, double inhale reinflates little sacks lungs.
long exhale, long exhale now much effective
reading body bloodstream carbon dioxide, relaxes quickly.
lab collaboration David Spiegel's lab, David's Associate Chair
Psychiatry Stanford, study right now exploring physiological sighs
patterns breathing done deliberately can modulate stress response
things related emotionality. work ongoing. want clear
studies aren't done. clear work labs, work Jack
Feldman's lab others, physiological sigh fastest, hardwired way us
eliminate stressful response body quickly real time. so, excited
give tool think people heard mindfulness
meditation good, exercise good us, need getting enough sleep, et
cetera, life happens. find position
alert activated like be, regardless whether not stressor
relationship-based financial physical anything like that, can look
physiological sigh bypasses important feature function,
hard control mind mind, especially
heightened states activation. alert sleepy, hard
use so-called top-down mechanisms intention gratitude things
really powerful tools not super activated stressed not super
tired. anywhere range alert stressed sleepy,
physiological sighs powerful way bringing level so-called autonomic
activation, just means level alertness down. so, whether not
line bank whether not wearing mask nowadays not,
whatever conditions may needs, feeling
stressed, physiological sigh done just one three times, will double inhale,
exhale, double inhale, exhale maybe just two times will bring level stress
very, fast.

00:34:53 Important Notes Heart Rate Deceleration: Vaso-vagal Lag

far know, fastest way accomplish that. important note
physiological sigh exhale-emphasized breathing lowering stress response.
Many people worry heart rate not come fast enough. want tell


not want heart rate reduce fast. actually something
called vasovagal response, people will stand get middle
night use bathroom sudden, collapse, faint.
heart rate reduced much. people will see blood
see something really troubling stressful pass out. over-
activation acceleration calming response. not stressed
kind fall off cliff stress. get stressed rebound mechanism
calming goes high, fast. calmed fast
collapse faint. so, aware going use physiological sigh
exhale-emphasized breathing calm down, heart rate will take 20 30
seconds come baseline. may need repeat physiological sigh
times. So, important note use breathing control levels
stress. thing decide look body control mind,
something else powerful. stressed mind body,
feeling really agitated, activated, worried, use tool like
physiological sigh exhale-emphasized breathing, will notice brain
mind becomes available controlling stress response reacting
it. great sweet spot life be, provided not trying
sleep, alert calm. so, idea. alert calm

00:36:50 Cyclic Sighing Calm Sleep Induction

bring back sort plane alertness.
trouble sleeping just relaxing day, physiological sigh can repeated
10, 15 cycles like. people find actually puts sleep. So,
lie reading many these, actually can put
sleep. find breath work protocols, kind stuff
done away real life, set aside time decide quote unquote,
breath work, works inhales longer
vigorous exhales, tends activating alert you.
exhales longer vigorous inhales, tends put sleep.
many protocols laboratories populate
internet wellness sites whatnot, exhale-emphasized breathing, oftentimes
used tool trying teach people fall asleep. Physiological sigh


little different. designed used real time. Just think just kind kit
things can life happens need react life. note
nasal versus mouth breathing, plethora information now

00:37:57 Nasal Breathing Cosmetic, Immune Performance Enhancement

James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science Lost Art," came
last year. Excellent book. well "Jaws" Sandra Kahn, Paul
Ehrlich foreword Jared Diamond Robert Sapolsky. So, collection
people Stanford. Jared Diamond not Stanford, rest are.
heavy hitters book, benefits nasal breathing. many
cases, nasal breathing advantageous mouth breathing sorts
things. Cosmetic features face, especially kids, warding off infection, et cetera.
physiological sigh, best way double inhale
nose, exhale mouth. can't, can
mouth, just mouth. want nose,
nose. anchors back underlying neurology neuroscience.

00:38:46 Two Breathing Centers Brain

So, want know, two breathing centers. One
involved rhythmic breathing inhales followed exhales, followed inhales
followed exhales. so-called pre-Botzinger nucleus named bottle wine
discovered Jack Feldman UCLA nearby nucleus called parafacial
nucleus also discovered Jack Feldman UCLA. parafacial nucleus
involved time double inhales double exhales. designed
breathe speaking can't always go inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale speaking. So, tell this, not overwhelm
knowledge, just know double inhales double
exhales, activating parafacial nucleus. cool effects.
located near neurons control face, also tendency
relax jaw. interplay neurons control speaking stuff
stuff tongue. So, sudden, physiological sigh,
tap neural circuitry allows us



00:39:45 Breathing Speaking Clearly

speak clearly, control muscles face jaw. Maybe means not
saying certain things stressed, just generally relax. so, brings
us back neuroscience parasympathetic nervous system. calming
system genetically encoded us have, regardless
parents are, neurons control stuff, face, eyes, et
cetera, working together. get stressed, hard us
speak tend jitter kinds things. Just like neurons cause
stress center spinal cord working together get body activated.
Okay, lot science today. now got physiological sigh tool. know
exhale-emphasized breathing will slow heart inhale-emphasized
breathing will speed heart up. So, think something now.

00:40:39 3 Types Stress: Short, Medium Long-Term

think stress not whether not acute chronic, whether not
good us bad us, three different timescales. can arrive
relates emotions. trust me, everything
emotions whether not functioning well emotionally not
functioning well emotionally, whether not coping not coping. So,
typically psychological terms psychological discussions. entering
portal physiology. stuff medical textbooks. will arrive
psychology soon, really want understand difference three
kinds stress three different timescales, short-term, medium-term, long-term,
good bad for. think heard stress bad
us. seen pictures intended frighten us. indeed frightening.
see nice really plump brain left. says healthy control.
see brain says stressed right like withered, see
hippocampus area involved memory smaller. People stressed.
see Alzheimer's brain made worse stress. people
predisposition schizophrenia, get stressed, higher incidence
schizophrenia episodes. hear addicts will relapse stressed.


mean, okay, get it. important, think heard now many
times stress bad.

00:42:10 Positive Effects Short-Term Stress: Immunity Focus

conversation, unfortunately, eclipsed really positive things
stress us short-term. So, stress can short-term, medium-term, long-
term. Long-term stress indeed bad reasons just mentioned many
others. never actually discussed stress terrific for, positive
short-term. think tend overlook important question,
short-term long-term? No one ever bothers tell us chronic,
acute. Right? five minutes? five days? duration final
exams? duration senior thesis college? No one actually draws
boundaries around stuff even general guidelines. so, become bit
mess, frankly, try decipher whole space around stress. So, going try
clean based know scientific data. First
all, acute stress, stress response hits, good immune system.
know might tough pill swallow, absolutely true. fact, stress often
comes form bacterial viral infection. stress response part
organized combat bacterial viral infection. pathways
brain centers activate neurons spinal cord make feel like
want move. neurons brain activate things like spleen,
will deploy killer cells go scavenge incoming bacteria viruses
try eat kill them. So, short-term stress release
adrenaline particular epinephrine, thing, adrenaline epinephrine, good
combating infection. just not discussed enough. So,
discussing here. relates particular tool many ask about,
don't often get opportunity talk appropriate context. not
ever inappropriate talk about, talk now use of,
again, respiration breathing somewhat artificially activate stress response.
will accomplish two things. Okay? return medium long-term stress,
want say short-term stress good dilation pupils, changes
optics eyes, quickening heart rate, sharpening cognition.
fact short-term stress brings certain elements brain online allow


focus. Now, narrows focus. not good seeing so-called big
picture, narrows focus. allows these, call duration path
outcome types analysis. allows evaluate environment, evaluate
need do. primes whole system better cognition. primes immune
system combat infection. makes sense think fact
famine, thirst, bacterial infections, viral infections, invaders, stuff liberates
response body designed get fight back whatever stressor
happens be. Psychological, physical, bacterial, viral. Again, stress response
generic.

00:45:32 Adrenalin (Epinephrine) Deploys Killer Immune Cells

tool takes advantage fact adrenaline released body
adrenals, effect also liberating lot killer cells immune
organs, particular spleen, elsewhere well, interactions
lymphatic system combat infection. way works real world best
captured study can mapped back so-called Wim Hof breathing. Now,
Wim Hof breathing named so-called "Iceman," Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
course, Dutch. He, think self-titled Daredevil. indeed
many, many Guinness Book World Records things like swimming icebergs
going Kilimanjaro shorts crossing desert without water, et cetera.
Things quite dangerous don't know doing. Wim obviously
survived telling survived. two components sort
breathing protocol

00:46:40 Cyclic Deep Breathing Stress: Wim Hof, Tummo & Super-Oxygenation

developed based also called Tummo breathing, T-U-M-M-O.
So, Wim, Tummo breathing. many people call now super
oxygenation breathing. Although breath work aficionados will probably say, well,
not super oxygenation also blowing awful lot carbon dioxide.
talking here, regardless whether not called Wim Hof, Tummo, super
oxygenation, rapid deliberate breathing. So, deliberate hyperventilation.
somebody want this? Well, deliberate hyperventilation done maybe 25 cycles.


inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. Typically, done nose
mouth. Although sometimes just mouth.
15 breaths, 20 breaths, 25 breaths, will feel alert. People anxiety will
feel anxious. might even anxiety attack. However, need ask
kind breathing feels way. pattern breathing, rapid
movements diaphragm will liberate adrenaline adrenals. So,
release adrenaline. mentioned Wim also called "The Iceman." Well,
actually discovered pattern breathing, somewhat. again, maps
back Tummo breathing going cold water. go cold water,
stressor liberate adrenaline response cold water. So, get
ice bath cold shower, will immediately release adrenaline adrenals.
Now, sorts things related psychological control stress
thresholds talk about, really want people understand
adrenaline released body, better position combat infections.
so, whether not breathe quickly cycles 25 breaths regardless
call it, doesn't matter, adrenaline released. take cold shower,
adrenaline released. go ice bath deliberately, even non-
deliberately, adrenaline released. mimicking stress response.
adrenaline serves suppress combat incoming infections. beautifully
shown study published fine journal, "Proceedings
National Academy Sciences US." literally called "Proceedings
National Academy USA" distinguish proceedings national
academies countries. way experiment went people injected
endotoxin cases injected bacterial wall mimics
infection. gives fever. makes feel nauseous. makes feel sick.
not pleasant. Half people particular pattern breathing looked
much like pattern breathing described moment ago 25 deep inhales
exhales followed exhale holding breath. repeating 25 inhales,
exhales holding breath. So, look something like this, listening,
sounds like [inhaling exhaling]. 25, 30 times, start feeling heated up.
start feeling adrenaline response. liberating adrenaline body.
exhale, hold breath 15 seconds repeat. typically,
three four rounds that, inhale deeply hold breath. Now,
want emphasize never ever, ever anywhere near water. People passed


out. So-called shallow water blackout. People died. Don't bathtub. Don't
hot tub. Don't swimming. Please don't anywhere near water.
Please don't all, unless get clearance doctor
pulmonary effects whatnot. breath holds definitely not
done anyone glaucoma pressure concerns eyes. repeated
cycles breathing liberate adrenaline allowed group protocol
essentially experience zero symptoms ejection E. coli,
remarkable. much reduced no symptoms. didn't feel feverish.
didn't feel sick. weren't vomiting, no diarrhea, remarkable, makes total
sense think fact short-term stress response there,
typically called acute stress response,

00:50:58 Inflammation Useful Good, Short Term

designed combat stressors. fact, cut deeply
hike woods, thing happen
rapid inflammation response. always hear inflammation bad. Inflammation
gives us Alzheimer's. Inflammation worst thing. swelling associated,
inflammation associated recruitment things like macrophages microglia
neural tissue. Cells brain body whose job act like little ambulances
rush site clean up. indeed inflammation response looks
horrible, sounds horrible, great thing short-term. want
tissue marked trouble want body brain react it. So,
getting peaks stress time time throughout day throughout week,
better position combat infection. better position heal
wounds, physical wounds. Many great things happen stress response. Now,
course, stress response

00:52:02 Procrastination Self-Manufactured Nootropics

isn't always super intense. Sometimes milder. Sometimes allows us just focus
something deadline. can feel stressful, one
reasons procrastinators there, people always asking can done
procrastination? can done procrastination can understand


happening, self-imposing stress stress acts like drug.
powerful nootropic. get asked nootropics. powerful nootropic
smart drug stress. concern failure. desire well.
impending deadline. the, "Oh gosh, thing now going
fail." best nootropic will ever find. combined good night's
sleep, talk about. spent whole month sleep. So, don't want
backtrack much. Okay. So, short-term stress, great. key able turn
stress response off done, don't want that.

00:53:00 Relaxation Can Causes Illness

fact, just really tamp relationship short-term acute stress
response infection. Many us familiar experience work, work, work,
work, work, taking care loved one, stress, stress, stress, stress, finally
relax. Maybe even go vacation. Like, "Oh, now finally going get break."
get sick. adrenaline response crashed
immune system crashed it. So, please understand this. Now, many might
say, "Well, long? two hours? three hours?" lot really
like specificity, will vary everybody. just kind use rule thumb.
no longer able achieve good sleep, good sleep means you,
please see episodes sleep want tools sleep,
no longer able achieve good sleep, now moving acute stress chronic

many wishes lifetime, one wish today hope will permeate
spread there, idea need young age, even adults
forever, need learn turn off stress response. Physiological sigh one.
going activate stress response intentionally ice baths, cold showers,
cyclic hyperoxygenated breathing, aka Tummo breathing Wim Hof breathing, also
need learn press brake. Okay? So, think stress system.
knows activate itself.

00:54:30 Immune Activation Protocol

Now talking way deliberately activating stress system order


combat infection. time time. might feel tickle throat like
getting kind run down, will kind breathing. do. will take 25 30 breaths.
Exhale, hold breath. 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold breath 15

inhale. hold breath feel impulse breathe. Again, feel safe
me. run doctor, fine. not unless right you.
this. people like ice bath. rarely ice bath. people like
cold showers. like hot showers. So, take hot showers, kind breathing.
Again, less effect

00:55:20 Medium Term Stress: Clear Definition

increasing adrenaline, allows combat infection
activating immune response. Okay. So, now talk medium-term stress.
Medium-term stress going stress lasts anywhere several days

01:06:30 Tools Dealing Long Term Stress

years end. best tools, best mechanisms know modulate long-
term stress might surprise little bit. First all, going things
don't surprise you, everyone knows getting regular exercise, getting good sleep,
using real-time tools try tamp stress response, et cetera, going
really useful. data really points fact social connection certain


types social connection particular going mitigate reduce long-
term stress. particularly important issue nowadays
proxies surrogates social connection. online texting people lot,
can feel connected. Like plane's take off everyone's texting
whether not fear flying not. like, "Okay, see you. Love
you. Hate you." Whatever trying communicate people. plane
lands, every phone's out, "See you. Love you. Hate you." hope fewer hate yous.
everyone kind need stay connected one another. Humans
incredibly social creatures. Now, way look whole business social
connection, not just kind wishy-washy new agey perspective. want
point sometimes say wishy-washy new agey. nothing that.
just, goal always put scientific data neurochemistry things
wishy-washy new agey stuff, also can arm
arguments members family life maybe
aren't tuned typical language around practices like, "Oh, connection
really key. get oxytocin."

01:08:20 Oxytocin Myth

Actually, know connection individuals rarely causes release
oxytocin? Oxytocin released particular circumstances like post-orgasm, baby
mother milk let down. associated kind really intense kinds pair bonding
things mother child. Also father child, especially mother child,
relationship lactation system. Couples post-sex. kinds things
reflect deep kind layers biology. oxytocin not just released

"Hi, great see you," fist bump. not situation oxytocin. way think
social connection can mitigate long-term effects stress
really systems neuromodulation

01:09:15 Serotonin: Satiety, Safety

like serotonin, blocking certain things really bad us feel
socially isolated. Things like Taqi Kynan. So, let explain are. Serotonin


again, neuromodulator. Neuromodulators little bit like playlists brain.

00:29:45 Fastlane Calm

kind unique way, kind twist, physiological sigh.


physiological sigh discovered '30s. now explored neuro-
biological level mechanistically far detail Jack Feldman's lab UCLA.
Also Mark Krasnow's lab Stanford. physiological sigh something
humans animals anytime fall asleep. also throughout
sleep time time carbon dioxide, talk moment, builds
much system. physiological sigh something people
naturally start crying trying recover air
calm sobbing hard claustrophobic
environments. However, amazing thing thing call diaphragm,
skeletal muscle, internal organ can control voluntarily, unlike
spleen heart pancreas can't just say, "Oh, want make
pancreas turn little insulin right now. just going mind
directly." can't that. can smelling really good donut
something, can't just directly. can move diaphragm intentionally,
right? can anytime want. it'll run background not
thinking it. So, incredible pathway goes brain diaphragm
called phrenic nerve, P-H-R-E-N-I-C. Phrenic. phrenic nerve innervates
diaphragm. can control anytime want. can double inhales
triple inhales. can exhale inhales. Whatever want do.
incredible organ. physiological sigh something
spontaneously. feeling stressed, can double inhale, [inhales
deeply] [exhales] long exhale. Now, just told minute ago inhale
exhale, going speed heart rate up, promote
stress activation. Now telling double inhale-exhale order calm
down. reason double inhale-exhale physiological sigh takes
advantage fact double inhale, even second inhale
sneaking just tiny bit air, kind hard get deep inhales back
back, big deep inhale another little ones sneaking in, little sacks
lungs. lungs. lungs just two big bags, got
millions little sacks throughout lungs actually make surface area
lungs big tennis court. amazing just spread out. tend
collapse get stressed. carbon dioxide builds bloodstream
one reasons feel agitated well. So, makes us jittery. mean,

double inhale-exhale, double inhale reinflates little sacks lungs.
long exhale, long exhale now much effective

very, fast.

00:34:53 Important Notes Heart Rate Deceleration: Vaso-vagal Lag

far know, fastest way accomplish that. important note
physiological sigh exhale-emphasized breathing lowering stress response.
Many people worry heart rate not come fast enough. want tell


not want heart rate reduce fast. actually something
called vasovagal response, people will stand get middle
night use bathroom sudden, collapse, faint.
heart rate reduced much. people will see blood
see something really troubling stressful pass out. over-
activation acceleration calming response. not stressed
kind fall off cliff stress. get stressed rebound mechanism
calming goes high, fast. calmed fast
collapse faint. so, aware going use physiological sigh
exhale-emphasized breathing calm down, heart rate will take 20 30
seconds come baseline. may need repeat physiological sigh
times. So, important note use breathing control levels
stress. thing decide look body control mind,
something else powerful. stressed mind body,
feeling really agitated, activated, worried, use tool like
physiological sigh exhale-emphasized breathing, will notice brain
mind becomes available controlling stress response reacting
it. great sweet spot life be, provided not trying
sleep, alert calm. so, idea. alert calm

00:36:50 Cyclic Sighing Calm Sleep Induction

bring back sort plane alertness.
trouble sleeping just relaxing day, physiological sigh can repeated
10, 15 cycles like. people find actually puts sleep. So,
lie reading many these, actually can put
sleep. find breath work protocols, kind stuff
done away real life, set aside time decide quote unquote,
breath work, works inhales longer

exhales longer vigorous inhales, tends put sleep.
many protocols laboratories populate
internet wellness sites whatnot, exhale-emphasized breathing, oftentimes
used tool trying teach people fall asleep. Physiological sigh


little different. designed used real time. Just think just kind kit
things can life happens need react life. note
nasal versus mouth breathing, plethora information now

00:37:57 Nasal Breathing Cosmetic, Immune Performance Enhancement

James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science Lost Art," came
last year. Excellent book. well "Jaws" Sandra Kahn, Paul
Ehrlich foreword Jared Diamond Robert Sapolsky. So, collection
people Stanford. Jared Diamond not Stanford, rest are.
heavy hitters book, benefits nasal breathing. many
cases, nasal breathing advantageous mouth breathing sorts
things. Cosmetic features face, especially kids, warding off infection, et cetera.
physiological sigh, best way double inhale
nose, exhale mouth. can't, can
mouth, just mouth. want nose,
nose. anchors back underlying neurology neuroscience.

00:38:46 Two Breathing Centers Brain

So, want know, two breathing centers. One
involved rhythmic breathing inhales followed exhales, followed inhales
followed exhales. so-called pre-Botzinger nucleus named bottle wine
discovered Jack Feldman UCLA nearby nucleus called parafacial
nucleus also discovered Jack Feldman UCLA. parafacial nucleus
involved time double inhales double exhales. designed
breathe speaking can't always go inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale speaking. So, tell this, not overwhelm
knowledge, just know double inhales double
exhales, activating parafacial nucleus. cool effects.
located near neurons control face, also tendency
relax jaw. interplay neurons control speaking stuff
stuff tongue. So, sudden, physiological sigh,
tap neural circuitry allows us



00:39:45 Breathing Speaking Clearly

speak clearly, control muscles face jaw. Maybe means not
saying certain things stressed, just generally relax. so, brings
us back neuroscience parasympathetic nervous system. calming
system genetically encoded us have, regardless
parents are, neurons control stuff, face, eyes, et
cetera, working together. get stressed, hard us
speak tend jitter kinds things. Just like neurons cause
stress center spinal cord working together get body activated.
Okay, lot science today. now got physiological sigh tool. know
exhale-emphasized breathing will slow heart inhale-emphasized
breathing will speed heart up. So, think something now.

00:40:39 3 Types Stress: Short, Medium Long-Term

think stress not whether not acute chronic, whether not
good us bad us, three different timescales. can arrive
relates emotions. trust me, everything
emotions whether not functioning well emotionally not
functioning well emotionally, whether not coping not coping. So,
typically psychological terms psychological discussions. entering
portal physiology. stuff medical textbooks. will arrive
psychology soon, really want understand difference three
kinds stress three different timescales, short-term, medium-term, long-term,
good bad for. think heard stress bad
us. seen pictures intended frighten us. indeed frightening.
see nice really plump brain left. says healthy control.
see brain says stressed right like withered, see
hippocampus area involved memory smaller. People stressed.
see Alzheimer's brain made worse stress. people
predisposition schizophrenia, get stressed, higher incidence
schizophrenia episodes. hear addicts will relapse stressed.


mean, okay, get it. important, think heard now many
times stress bad.

00:42:10 Positive Effects Short-Term Stress: Immunity Focus

conversation, unfortunately, eclipsed really positive things
stress us short-term. So, stress can short-term, medium-term, long-
term. Long-term stress indeed bad reasons just mentioned many
others. never actually discussed stress terrific for, positive
short-term. think tend overlook important question,
short-term long-term? No one ever bothers tell us chronic,
acute. Right? five minutes? five days? duration final
exams? duration senior thesis college? No one actually draws
boundaries around stuff even general guidelines. so, become bit
mess, frankly, try decipher whole space around stress. So, going try
clean based know scientific data. First
all, acute stress, stress response hits, good immune system.
know might tough pill swallow, absolutely true. fact, stress often
comes form bacterial viral infection. stress response part
organized combat bacterial viral infection. pathways
brain centers activate neurons spinal cord make feel like
want move. neurons brain activate things like spleen,
will deploy killer cells go scavenge incoming bacteria viruses
try eat kill them. So, short-term stress release
adrenaline particular epinephrine, thing, adrenaline epinephrine, good
combating infection. just not discussed enough. So,
discussing here. relates particular tool many ask about,
don't often get opportunity talk appropriate context. not
ever inappropriate talk about, talk now use of,
again, respiration breathing somewhat artificially activate stress response.
will accomplish two things. Okay? return medium long-term stress,
want say short-term stress good dilation pupils, changes
optics eyes, quickening heart rate, sharpening cognition.
fact short-term stress brings certain elements brain online allow


focus. Now, narrows focus. not good seeing so-called big
picture, narrows focus. allows these, call duration path
outcome types analysis. allows evaluate environment, evaluate
need do. primes whole system better cognition. primes immune
system combat infection. makes sense think fact
famine, thirst, bacterial infections, viral infections, invaders, stuff liberates
response body designed get fight back whatever stressor
happens be. Psychological, physical, bacterial, viral. Again, stress response
generic.

00:45:32 Adrenalin (Epinephrine) Deploys Killer Immune Cells

tool takes advantage fact adrenaline released body
adrenals, effect also liberating lot killer cells immune
organs, particular spleen, elsewhere well, interactions
lymphatic system combat infection. way works real world best
captured study can mapped back so-called Wim Hof breathing. Now,
Wim Hof breathing named so-called "Iceman," Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
course, Dutch. He, think self-titled Daredevil. indeed
many, many Guinness Book World Records things like swimming icebergs
going Kilimanjaro shorts crossing desert without water, et cetera.
Things quite dangerous don't know doing. Wim obviously
survived telling survived. two components sort
breathing protocol

00:46:40 Cyclic Deep Breathing Stress: Wim Hof, Tummo & Super-Oxygenation

developed based also called Tummo breathing, T-U-M-M-O.
So, Wim, Tummo breathing. many people call now super
oxygenation breathing. Although breath work aficionados will probably say, well,
not super oxygenation also blowing awful lot carbon dioxide.
talking here, regardless whether not called Wim Hof, Tummo, super
oxygenation, rapid deliberate breathing. So, deliberate hyperventilation.
somebody want this? Well, deliberate hyperventilation done maybe 25 cycles.


inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. Typically, done nose
mouth. Although sometimes just mouth.
15 breaths, 20 breaths, 25 breaths, will feel alert. People anxiety will
feel anxious. might even anxiety attack. However, need ask
kind breathing feels way. pattern breathing, rapid
movements diaphragm will liberate adrenaline adrenals. So,
release adrenaline. mentioned Wim also called "The Iceman." Well,
actually discovered pattern breathing, somewhat. again, maps
back Tummo breathing going cold water. go cold water,
stressor liberate adrenaline response cold water. So, get
ice bath cold shower, will immediately release adrenaline adrenals.
Now, sorts things related psychological control stress
thresholds talk about, really want people understand
adrenaline released body, better position combat infections.
so, whether not breathe quickly cycles 25 breaths regardless
call it, doesn't matter, adrenaline released. take cold shower,
adrenaline released. go ice bath deliberately, even non-
deliberately, adrenaline released. mimicking stress response.
adrenaline serves suppress combat incoming infections. beautifully
shown study published fine journal, "Proceedings
National Academy Sciences US." literally called "Proceedings
National Academy USA" distinguish proceedings national
academies countries. way experiment went people injected
endotoxin cases injected bacterial wall mimics
infection. gives fever. makes feel nauseous. makes feel sick.
not pleasant. Half people particular pattern breathing looked
much like pattern breathing described moment ago 25 deep inhales
exhales followed exhale holding breath. repeating 25 inhales,
exhales holding breath. So, look something like this, listening,
sounds like [inhaling exhaling]. 25, 30 times, start feeling heated up.
start feeling adrenaline response. liberating adrenaline body.
exhale, hold breath 15 seconds repeat. typically,
three four rounds that, inhale deeply hold breath. Now,
want emphasize never ever, ever anywhere near water. People passed


out. So-called shallow water blackout. People died. Don't bathtub. Don't
hot tub. Don't swimming. Please don't anywhere near water.
Please don't all, unless get clearance doctor
pulmonary effects whatnot. breath holds definitely not
done anyone glaucoma pressure concerns eyes. repeated
cycles breathing liberate adrenaline allowed group protocol
essentially experience zero symptoms ejection E. coli,
remarkable. much reduced no symptoms. didn't feel feverish.
didn't feel sick. weren't vomiting, no diarrhea, remarkable, makes total
sense think fact short-term stress response there,
typically called acute stress response,

00:50:58 Inflammation Useful Good, Short Term

designed combat stressors. fact, cut deeply
hike woods, thing happen
rapid inflammation response. always hear inflammation bad. Inflammation
gives us Alzheimer's. Inflammation worst thing. swelling associated,
inflammation associated recruitment things like macrophages microglia
neural tissue. Cells brain body whose job act like little ambulances
rush site clean up. indeed inflammation response looks
horrible, sounds horrible, great thing short-term. want
tissue marked trouble want body brain react it. So,
getting peaks stress time time throughout day throughout week,
better position combat infection. better position heal
wounds, physical wounds. Many great things happen stress response. Now,
course, stress response

00:52:02 Procrastination Self-Manufactured Nootropics

isn't always super intense. Sometimes milder. Sometimes allows us just focus
something deadline. can feel stressful, one
reasons procrastinators there, people always asking can done
procrastination? can done procrastination can understand


happening, self-imposing stress stress acts like drug.
powerful nootropic. get asked nootropics. powerful nootropic
smart drug stress. concern failure. desire well.
impending deadline. the, "Oh gosh, thing now going
fail." best nootropic will ever find. combined good night's
sleep, talk about. spent whole month sleep. So, don't want
backtrack much. Okay. So, short-term stress, great. key able turn
stress response off done, don't want that.

00:53:00 Relaxation Can Causes Illness

fact, just really tamp relationship short-term acute stress
response infection. Many us familiar experience work, work, work,

01:06:30 Tools Dealing Long Term Stress

years end. best tools, best mechanisms know modulate long-
term stress might surprise little bit. First all, going things
don't surprise you, everyone knows getting regular exercise, getting good sleep,
using real-time tools try tamp stress response, et cetera, going
really useful. data really points fact social connection certain


types social connection particular going mitigate reduce long-
term stress. particularly important issue nowadays
proxies surrogates social connection. online texting people lot,
can feel connected. Like plane's take off everyone's texting
whether not fear flying not. like, "Okay, see you. Love
you. Hate you." Whatever trying communicate people. plane
lands, every phone's out, "See you. Love you. Hate you." hope fewer hate yous.
everyone kind need stay connected one another. Humans
incredibly social creatures. Now, way look whole business social

just, goal always put scientific data neurochemistry things
wishy-washy new agey stuff, also can arm

really key. get oxytocin."

01:08:20 Oxytocin Myth

Actually, know connection individuals rarely causes release
oxytocin? Oxytocin released particular circumstances like post-orgasm, baby
mother milk let down. associated kind really intense kinds pair bonding
things mother child. Also father child, especially mother child,
relationship lactation system. Couples post-sex. kinds things
reflect deep kind layers biology. oxytocin not just released

"Hi, great see you," fist bump. not situation oxytocin. way think
social connection can mitigate long-term effects stress
really systems neuromodulation

01:09:15 Serotonin: Satiety, Safety

like serotonin, blocking certain things really bad us feel

many may feel exhausted chronic stress, isn't really physiological
exhaustion happens. eventually got picked ran general

something, however, called adrenal insufficiency syndrome, real
physiological problem people impaired adrenals can't

works. exhale, diaphragm moves up, makes heart little bit
smaller. actually gets little compact. Blood flows quickly
compact space sort like just pipe getting smaller. sinoatrial node registers
blood going quickly, sends signal brain. parasympathetic

slow heart down. So, want calm quickly, need make
exhales longer vigorous inhales. Now, reason
attractive tool controlling stress works real time. doesn't involve
practice go sit anything separate life.
going get emotion. Emotions stress happen real time. so,
wonderful breath work practice opportunity get massage
sit sauna whatever order set stress controls
right direction, tools can reach real time require no learning,
mean, teach you, learn that, doesn't require plasticy
activate pathways. So, feeling stressed, still need inhale, course,
need lengthen exhales. Now, tool capitalizes

00:29:45 Fastlane Calm

kind unique way, kind twist, physiological sigh.


physiological sigh discovered '30s. now explored neuro-
biological level mechanistically far detail Jack Feldman's lab UCLA.
Also Mark Krasnow's lab Stanford. physiological sigh something
humans animals anytime fall asleep. also throughout
sleep time time carbon dioxide, talk moment, builds
much system. physiological sigh something people
naturally start crying trying recover air
calm sobbing hard claustrophobic
environments. However, amazing thing thing call diaphragm,
skeletal muscle, internal organ can control voluntarily, unlike
spleen heart pancreas can't just say, "Oh, want make
pancreas turn little insulin right now. just going mind
directly." can't that. can smelling really good donut
something, can't just directly. can move diaphragm intentionally,
right? can anytime want. it'll run background not
thinking it. So, incredible pathway goes brain diaphragm
called phrenic nerve, P-H-R-E-N-I-C. Phrenic. phrenic nerve innervates
diaphragm. can control anytime want. can double inhales
triple inhales. can exhale inhales. Whatever want do.
incredible organ. physiological sigh something
spontaneously. feeling stressed, can double inhale, [inhales
deeply] [exhales] long exhale. Now, just told minute ago inhale
exhale, going speed heart rate up, promote
stress activation. Now telling double inhale-exhale order calm
down. reason double inhale-exhale physiological sigh takes
advantage fact double inhale, even second inhale
sneaking just tiny bit air, kind hard get deep inhales back
back, big deep inhale another little ones sneaking in, little sacks
lungs. lungs. lungs just two big bags, got
millions little sacks throughout lungs actually make surface area
lungs big tennis court. amazing just spread out. tend
collapse get stressed. carbon dioxide builds bloodstream
one reasons feel agitated well. So, makes us jittery. mean,
effects carbon dioxide don't want get into,


double inhale-exhale, double inhale reinflates little sacks lungs.
long exhale, long exhale now much effective
reading body bloodstream carbon dioxide, relaxes quickly.
lab collaboration David Spiegel's lab, David's Associate Chair
Psychiatry Stanford, study right now exploring physiological sighs
patterns breathing done deliberately can modulate stress response
things related emotionality. work ongoing. want clear
studies aren't done. clear work labs, work Jack
Feldman's lab others, physiological sigh fastest, hardwired way us
eliminate stressful response body quickly real time. so, excited
give tool think people heard mindfulness
meditation good, exercise good us, need getting enough sleep, et
cetera, life happens. find position
alert activated like be, regardless whether not stressor
relationship-based financial physical anything like that, can look
physiological sigh bypasses important feature function,
hard control mind mind, especially
heightened states activation. alert sleepy, hard
use so-called top-down mechanisms intention gratitude things
really powerful tools not super activated stressed not super
tired. anywhere range alert stressed sleepy,
physiological sighs powerful way bringing level so-called autonomic
activation, just means level alertness down. so, whether not
line bank whether not wearing mask nowadays not,
whatever conditions may needs, feeling
stressed, physiological sigh done just one three times, will double inhale,
exhale, double inhale, exhale maybe just two times will bring level stress
very, fast.

00:34:53 Important Notes Heart Rate Deceleration: Vaso-vagal Lag

far know, fastest way accomplish that. important note
physiological sigh exhale-emphasized breathing lowering stress response.
Many people worry heart rate not come fast enough. want tell


not want heart rate reduce fast. actually something
called vasovagal response, people will stand get middle
night use bathroom sudden, collapse, faint.
heart rate reduced much. people will see blood
see something really troubling stressful pass out. over-
activation acceleration calming response. not stressed
kind fall off cliff stress. get stressed rebound mechanism
calming goes high, fast. calmed fast
collapse faint. so, aware going use physiological sigh
exhale-emphasized breathing calm down, heart rate will take 20 30
seconds come baseline. may need repeat physiological sigh
times. So, important note use breathing control levels
stress. thing decide look body control mind,
something else powerful. stressed mind body,
feeling really agitated, activated, worried, use tool like
physiological sigh exhale-emphasized breathing, will notice brain
mind becomes available controlling stress response reacting
it. great sweet spot life be, provided not trying
sleep, alert calm. so, idea. alert calm

00:36:50 Cyclic Sighing Calm Sleep Induction

bring back sort plane alertness.
trouble sleeping just relaxing day, physiological sigh can repeated
10, 15 cycles like. people find actually puts sleep. So,
lie reading many these, actually can put
sleep. find breath work protocols, kind stuff
done away real life, set aside time decide quote unquote,
breath work, works inhales longer
vigorous exhales, tends activating alert you.
exhales longer vigorous inhales, tends put sleep.
many protocols laboratories populate
internet wellness sites whatnot, exhale-emphasized breathing, oftentimes
used tool trying teach people fall asleep. Physiological sigh


little different. designed used real time. Just think just kind kit
things can life happens need react life. note
nasal versus mouth breathing, plethora information now

00:37:57 Nasal Breathing Cosmetic, Immune Performance Enhancement

James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science Lost Art," came
last year. Excellent book. well "Jaws" Sandra Kahn, Paul
Ehrlich foreword Jared Diamond Robert Sapolsky. So, collection
people Stanford. Jared Diamond not Stanford, rest are.
heavy hitters book, benefits nasal breathing. many
cases, nasal breathing advantageous mouth breathing sorts
things. Cosmetic features face, especially kids, warding off infection, et cetera.
physiological sigh, best way double inhale
nose, exhale mouth. can't, can
mouth, just mouth. want nose,
nose. anchors back underlying neurology neuroscience.

00:38:46 Two Breathing Centers Brain

So, want know, two breathing centers. One
involved rhythmic breathing inhales followed exhales, followed inhales
followed exhales. so-called pre-Botzinger nucleus named bottle wine
discovered Jack Feldman UCLA nearby nucleus called parafacial
nucleus also discovered Jack Feldman UCLA. parafacial nucleus
involved time double inhales double exhales. designed
breathe speaking can't always go inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale speaking. So, tell this, not overwhelm
knowledge, just know double inhales double
exhales, activating parafacial nucleus. cool effects.
located near neurons control face, also tendency
relax jaw. interplay neurons control speaking stuff
stuff tongue. So, sudden, physiological sigh,
tap neural circuitry allows us



00:39:45 Breathing Speaking Clearly

speak clearly, control muscles face jaw. Maybe means not
saying certain things stressed, just generally relax. so, brings
us back neuroscience parasympathetic nervous system. calming
system genetically encoded us have, regardless
parents are, neurons control stuff, face, eyes, et
cetera, working together. get stressed, hard us
speak tend jitter kinds things. Just like neurons cause
stress center spinal cord working together get body activated.
Okay, lot science today. now got physiological sigh tool. know
exhale-emphasized breathing will slow heart inhale-emphasized
breathing will speed heart up. So, think something now.

00:40:39 3 Types Stress: Short, Medium Long-Term

think stress not whether not acute chronic, whether not
good us bad us, three different timescales. can arrive
relates emotions. trust me, everything
emotions whether not functioning well emotionally not
functioning well emotionally, whether not coping not coping. So,
typically psychological terms psychological discussions. entering
portal physiology. stuff medical textbooks. will arrive
psychology soon, really want understand difference three
kinds stress three different timescales, short-term, medium-term, long-term,
good bad for. think heard stress bad
us. seen pictures intended frighten us. indeed frightening.
see nice really plump brain left. says healthy control.
see brain says stressed right like withered, see
hippocampus area involved memory smaller. People stressed.
see Alzheimer's brain made worse stress. people
predisposition schizophrenia, get stressed, higher incidence
schizophrenia episodes. hear addicts will relapse stressed.


mean, okay, get it. important, think heard now many
times stress bad.

00:42:10 Positive Effects Short-Term Stress: Immunity Focus

conversation, unfortunately, eclipsed really positive things
stress us short-term. So, stress can short-term, medium-term, long-
term. Long-term stress indeed bad reasons just mentioned many
others. never actually discussed stress terrific for, positive
short-term. think tend overlook important question,
short-term long-term? No one ever bothers tell us chronic,
acute. Right? five minutes? five days? duration final
exams? duration senior thesis college? No one actually draws
boundaries around stuff even general guidelines. so, become bit
mess, frankly, try decipher whole space around stress. So, going try
clean based know scientific data. First
all, acute stress, stress response hits, good immune system.
know might tough pill swallow, absolutely true. fact, stress often
comes form bacterial viral infection. stress response part
organized combat bacterial viral infection. pathways
brain centers activate neurons spinal cord make feel like
want move. neurons brain activate things like spleen,
will deploy killer cells go scavenge incoming bacteria viruses
try eat kill them. So, short-term stress release
adrenaline particular epinephrine, thing, adrenaline epinephrine, good
combating infection. just not discussed enough. So,
discussing here. relates particular tool many ask about,
don't often get opportunity talk appropriate context. not
ever inappropriate talk about, talk now use of,
again, respiration breathing somewhat artificially activate stress response.
will accomplish two things. Okay? return medium long-term stress,
want say short-term stress good dilation pupils, changes
optics eyes, quickening heart rate, sharpening cognition.
fact short-term stress brings certain elements brain online allow


focus. Now, narrows focus. not good seeing so-called big
picture, narrows focus. allows these, call duration path
outcome types analysis. allows evaluate environment, evaluate
need do. primes whole system better cognition. primes immune
system combat infection. makes sense think fact
famine, thirst, bacterial infections, viral infections, invaders, stuff liberates
response body designed get fight back whatever stressor
happens be. Psychological, physical, bacterial, viral. Again, stress response
generic.

00:45:32 Adrenalin (Epinephrine) Deploys Killer Immune Cells

tool takes advantage fact adrenaline released body
adrenals, effect also liberating lot killer cells immune
organs, particular spleen, elsewhere well, interactions
lymphatic system combat infection. way works real world best
captured study can mapped back so-called Wim Hof breathing. Now,
Wim Hof breathing named so-called "Iceman," Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
course, Dutch. He, think self-titled Daredevil. indeed
many, many Guinness Book World Records things like swimming icebergs
going Kilimanjaro shorts crossing desert without water, et cetera.
Things quite dangerous don't know doing. Wim obviously
survived telling survived. two components sort
breathing protocol

00:46:40 Cyclic Deep Breathing Stress: Wim Hof, Tummo & Super-Oxygenation

developed based also called Tummo breathing, T-U-M-M-O.
So, Wim, Tummo breathing. many people call now super
oxygenation breathing. Although breath work aficionados will probably say, well,
not super oxygenation also blowing awful lot carbon dioxide.
talking here, regardless whether not called Wim Hof, Tummo, super
oxygenation, rapid deliberate breathing. So, deliberate hyperventilation.
somebody want this? Well, deliberate hyperventilation done maybe 25 cycles.


inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. Typically, done nose
mouth. Although sometimes just mouth.
15 breaths, 20 breaths, 25 breaths, will feel alert. People anxiety will
feel anxious. might even anxiety attack. However, need ask
kind breathing feels way. pattern breathing, rapid
movements diaphragm will liberate adrenaline adrenals. So,
release adrenaline. mentioned Wim also called "The Iceman." Well,
actually discovered pattern breathing, somewhat. again, maps
back Tummo breathing going cold water. go cold water,
stressor liberate adrenaline response cold water. So, get
ice bath cold shower, will immediately release adrenaline adrenals.
Now, sorts things related psychological control stress
thresholds talk about, really want people understand
adrenaline released body, better position combat infections.
so, whether not breathe quickly cycles 25 breaths regardless
call it, doesn't matter, adrenaline released. take cold shower,
adrenaline released. go ice bath deliberately, even non-
deliberately, adrenaline released. mimicking stress response.
adrenaline serves suppress combat incoming infections. beautifully
shown study published fine journal, "Proceedings
National Academy Sciences US." literally called "Proceedings
National Academy USA" distinguish proceedings national
academies countries. way experiment went people injected
endotoxin cases injected bacterial wall mimics
infection. gives fever. makes feel nauseous. makes feel sick.
not pleasant. Half people particular pattern breathing looked
much like pattern breathing described moment ago 25 deep inhales
exhales followed exhale holding breath. repeating 25 inhales,
exhales holding breath. So, look something like this, listening,
sounds like [inhaling exhaling]. 25, 30 times, start feeling heated up.
start feeling adrenaline response. liberating adrenaline body.
exhale, hold breath 15 seconds repeat. typically,
three four rounds that, inhale deeply hold breath. Now,
want emphasize never ever, ever anywhere near water. People passed


out. So-called shallow water blackout. People died. Don't bathtub. Don't
hot tub. Don't swimming. Please don't anywhere near water.
Please don't all, unless get clearance doctor
pulmonary effects whatnot. breath holds definitely not
done anyone glaucoma pressure concerns eyes. repeated
cycles breathing liberate adrenaline allowed group protocol
essentially experience zero symptoms ejection E. coli,
remarkable. much reduced no symptoms. didn't feel feverish.
didn't feel sick. weren't vomiting, no diarrhea, remarkable, makes total
sense think fact short-term stress response there,
typically called acute stress response,

00:50:58 Inflammation Useful Good, Short Term

designed combat stressors. fact, cut deeply
hike woods, thing happen
rapid inflammation response. always hear inflammation bad. Inflammation
gives us Alzheimer's. Inflammation worst thing. swelling associated,
inflammation associated recruitment things like macrophages microglia
neural tissue. Cells brain body whose job act like little ambulances
rush site clean up. indeed inflammation response looks
horrible, sounds horrible, great thing short-term. want
tissue marked trouble want body brain react it. So,
getting peaks stress time time throughout day throughout week,
better position combat infection. better position heal
wounds, physical wounds. Many great things happen stress response. Now,
course, stress response

00:52:02 Procrastination Self-Manufactured Nootropics

isn't always super intense. Sometimes milder. Sometimes allows us just focus
something deadline. can feel stressful, one
reasons procrastinators there, people always asking can done
procrastination? can done procrastination can understand


happening, self-imposing stress stress acts like drug.
powerful nootropic. get asked nootropics. powerful nootropic
smart drug stress. concern failure. desire well.
impending deadline. the, "Oh gosh, thing now going
fail." best nootropic will ever find. combined good night's
sleep, talk about. spent whole month sleep. So, don't want
backtrack much. Okay. So, short-term stress, great. key able turn
stress response off done, don't want that.

00:53:00 Relaxation Can Causes Illness

fact, just really tamp relationship short-term acute stress
response infection. Many us familiar experience work, work, work,
work, work, taking care loved one, stress, stress, stress, stress, finally
relax. Maybe even go vacation. Like, "Oh, now finally going get break."
get sick. adrenaline response crashed
immune system crashed it. So, please understand this. Now, many might
say, "Well, long? two hours? three hours?" lot really
like specificity, will vary everybody. just kind use rule thumb.
no longer able achieve good sleep, good sleep means you,
please see episodes sleep want tools sleep,
no longer able achieve good sleep, now moving acute stress chronic
stress. need able turn stress response off. one wish, well,
many wishes lifetime, one wish today hope will permeate
spread there, idea need young age, even adults
forever, need learn turn off stress response. Physiological sigh one.
going activate stress response intentionally ice baths, cold showers,
cyclic hyperoxygenated breathing, aka Tummo breathing Wim Hof breathing, also
need learn press brake. Okay? So, think stress system.
knows activate itself.

00:54:30 Immune Activation Protocol

Now talking way deliberately activating stress system order


combat infection. time time. might feel tickle throat like
getting kind run down, will kind breathing. do. will take 25 30 breaths.
Exhale, hold breath. 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold breath 15
seconds. 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold breath 25 30 seconds. big
inhale. hold breath feel impulse breathe. Again, feel safe
me. run doctor, fine. not unless right you.
this. people like ice bath. rarely ice bath. people like
cold showers. like hot showers. So, take hot showers, kind breathing.
Again, less effect

00:55:20 Medium Term Stress: Clear Definition

increasing adrenaline, allows combat infection
activating immune response. Okay. So, now talk medium-term stress.
Medium-term stress going stress lasts anywhere several days

heart rate like 50 60 something like that. great. But,
now higher running little bit less. everyone needs

01:06:30 Tools Dealing Long Term Stress

years end. best tools, best mechanisms know modulate long-
term stress might surprise little bit. First all, going things
don't surprise you, everyone knows getting regular exercise, getting good sleep,
using real-time tools try tamp stress response, et cetera, going
really useful. data really points fact social connection certain


types social connection particular going mitigate reduce long-
term stress. particularly important issue nowadays
proxies surrogates social connection. online texting people lot,
can feel connected. Like plane's take off everyone's texting
whether not fear flying not. like, "Okay, see you. Love
you. Hate you." Whatever trying communicate people. plane
lands, every phone's out, "See you. Love you. Hate you." hope fewer hate yous.
everyone kind need stay connected one another. Humans
incredibly social creatures. Now, way look whole business social
connection, not just kind wishy-washy new agey perspective. want
point sometimes say wishy-washy new agey. nothing that.
just, goal always put scientific data neurochemistry things
wishy-washy new agey stuff, also can arm
arguments members family life maybe
aren't tuned typical language around practices like, "Oh, connection
really key. get oxytocin."

01:08:20 Oxytocin Myth

Actually, know connection individuals rarely causes release
oxytocin? Oxytocin released particular circumstances like post-orgasm, baby
mother milk let down. associated kind really intense kinds pair bonding
things mother child. Also father child, especially mother child,
relationship lactation system. Couples post-sex. kinds things
reflect deep kind layers biology. oxytocin not just released
walk pat dog head see somebody give hug and,
"Hi, great see you," fist bump. not situation oxytocin. way think
social connection can mitigate long-term effects stress
really systems neuromodulation

01:09:15 Serotonin: Satiety, Safety

like serotonin, blocking certain things really bad us feel
socially isolated. Things like Taqi Kynan. So, let explain are. Serotonin


again, neuromodulator. Neuromodulators little bit like playlists brain.

01:19:15 Adrenal Burnout Myth… Need Know Anyway

point can become problematic. Now, note adrenal burnout.
actually no thing adrenal burnout normal conditions. adrenals

adrenal burnout origins work Nobel Prize winner, Hans Selye, actually
discovered called general adaptation syndrome. discovered lot
things stress. phenomenal work turned true.

eventually reach phase called exhaustion. turned wrong. Although
many may feel exhausted chronic stress, isn't really physiological
exhaustion happens. eventually got picked ran general
public. talk adrenal burnout. much coffee, adrenal burnout. hear
stuff. no thing adrenal burnout. adrenals don't burn out.
something, however, called adrenal insufficiency syndrome, real
physiological problem people impaired adrenals can't
produce adrenaline. melatonin taken high levels periods time
long can cause suppression cortisol epinephrine released
adrenals can create kind pseudo adrenal insufficiency syndrome. So, aware
melatonin reason. Please, trying, alone can't get rid phrase adrenal

discussion around emotions far nuanced elaborate this,
one way think relationship emotions whether not internal state

00:29:45 Fastlane Calm

kind unique way, kind twist, physiological sigh.


physiological sigh discovered '30s. now explored neuro-
biological level mechanistically far detail Jack Feldman's lab UCLA.
Also Mark Krasnow's lab Stanford. physiological sigh something
humans animals anytime fall asleep. also throughout
sleep time time carbon dioxide, talk moment, builds
much system. physiological sigh something people
naturally start crying trying recover air
calm sobbing hard claustrophobic
environments. However, amazing thing thing call diaphragm,
skeletal muscle, internal organ can control voluntarily, unlike
spleen heart pancreas can't just say, "Oh, want make
pancreas turn little insulin right now. just going mind
directly." can't that. can smelling really good donut
something, can't just directly. can move diaphragm intentionally,
right? can anytime want. it'll run background not
thinking it. So, incredible pathway goes brain diaphragm
called phrenic nerve, P-H-R-E-N-I-C. Phrenic. phrenic nerve innervates
diaphragm. can control anytime want. can double inhales
triple inhales. can exhale inhales. Whatever want do.
incredible organ. physiological sigh something
spontaneously. feeling stressed, can double inhale, [inhales
deeply] [exhales] long exhale. Now, just told minute ago inhale
exhale, going speed heart rate up, promote
stress activation. Now telling double inhale-exhale order calm
down. reason double inhale-exhale physiological sigh takes
advantage fact double inhale, even second inhale
sneaking just tiny bit air, kind hard get deep inhales back
back, big deep inhale another little ones sneaking in, little sacks
lungs. lungs. lungs just two big bags, got
millions little sacks throughout lungs actually make surface area
lungs big tennis court. amazing just spread out. tend
collapse get stressed. carbon dioxide builds bloodstream
one reasons feel agitated well. So, makes us jittery. mean,
effects carbon dioxide don't want get into,


double inhale-exhale, double inhale reinflates little sacks lungs.
long exhale, long exhale now much effective
reading body bloodstream carbon dioxide, relaxes quickly.
lab collaboration David Spiegel's lab, David's Associate Chair
Psychiatry Stanford, study right now exploring physiological sighs
patterns breathing done deliberately can modulate stress response
things related emotionality. work ongoing. want clear
studies aren't done. clear work labs, work Jack
Feldman's lab others, physiological sigh fastest, hardwired way us
eliminate stressful response body quickly real time. so, excited
give tool think people heard mindfulness
meditation good, exercise good us, need getting enough sleep, et
cetera, life happens. find position
alert activated like be, regardless whether not stressor
relationship-based financial physical anything like that, can look
physiological sigh bypasses important feature function,
hard control mind mind, especially
heightened states activation. alert sleepy, hard
use so-called top-down mechanisms intention gratitude things
really powerful tools not super activated stressed not super
tired. anywhere range alert stressed sleepy,
physiological sighs powerful way bringing level so-called autonomic
activation, just means level alertness down. so, whether not
line bank whether not wearing mask nowadays not,
whatever conditions may needs, feeling
stressed, physiological sigh done just one three times, will double inhale,
exhale, double inhale, exhale maybe just two times will bring level stress
very, fast.

00:34:53 Important Notes Heart Rate Deceleration: Vaso-vagal Lag

far know, fastest way accomplish that. important note
physiological sigh exhale-emphasized breathing lowering stress response.
Many people worry heart rate not come fast enough. want tell


not want heart rate reduce fast. actually something
called vasovagal response, people will stand get middle
night use bathroom sudden, collapse, faint.
heart rate reduced much. people will see blood
see something really troubling stressful pass out. over-
activation acceleration calming response. not stressed
kind fall off cliff stress. get stressed rebound mechanism
calming goes high, fast. calmed fast
collapse faint. so, aware going use physiological sigh
exhale-emphasized breathing calm down, heart rate will take 20 30
seconds come baseline. may need repeat physiological sigh
times. So, important note use breathing control levels
stress. thing decide look body control mind,
something else powerful. stressed mind body,
feeling really agitated, activated, worried, use tool like
physiological sigh exhale-emphasized breathing, will notice brain
mind becomes available controlling stress response reacting
it. great sweet spot life be, provided not trying
sleep, alert calm. so, idea. alert calm

00:36:50 Cyclic Sighing Calm Sleep Induction

bring back sort plane alertness.
trouble sleeping just relaxing day, physiological sigh can repeated
10, 15 cycles like. people find actually puts sleep. So,
lie reading many these, actually can put
sleep. find breath work protocols, kind stuff
done away real life, set aside time decide quote unquote,
breath work, works inhales longer
vigorous exhales, tends activating alert you.
exhales longer vigorous inhales, tends put sleep.
many protocols laboratories populate
internet wellness sites whatnot, exhale-emphasized breathing, oftentimes
used tool trying teach people fall asleep. Physiological sigh


little different. designed used real time. Just think just kind kit
things can life happens need react life. note
nasal versus mouth breathing, plethora information now

00:37:57 Nasal Breathing Cosmetic, Immune Performance Enhancement

James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science Lost Art," came
last year. Excellent book. well "Jaws" Sandra Kahn, Paul
Ehrlich foreword Jared Diamond Robert Sapolsky. So, collection
people Stanford. Jared Diamond not Stanford, rest are.
heavy hitters book, benefits nasal breathing. many
cases, nasal breathing advantageous mouth breathing sorts
things. Cosmetic features face, especially kids, warding off infection, et cetera.
physiological sigh, best way double inhale
nose, exhale mouth. can't, can
mouth, just mouth. want nose,
nose. anchors back underlying neurology neuroscience.

00:38:46 Two Breathing Centers Brain

So, want know, two breathing centers. One
involved rhythmic breathing inhales followed exhales, followed inhales
followed exhales. so-called pre-Botzinger nucleus named bottle wine
discovered Jack Feldman UCLA nearby nucleus called parafacial
nucleus also discovered Jack Feldman UCLA. parafacial nucleus
involved time double inhales double exhales. designed
breathe speaking can't always go inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale speaking. So, tell this, not overwhelm
knowledge, just know double inhales double
exhales, activating parafacial nucleus. cool effects.
located near neurons control face, also tendency
relax jaw. interplay neurons control speaking stuff
stuff tongue. So, sudden, physiological sigh,
tap neural circuitry allows us



00:39:45 Breathing Speaking Clearly

speak clearly, control muscles face jaw. Maybe means not
saying certain things stressed, just generally relax. so, brings
us back neuroscience parasympathetic nervous system. calming
system genetically encoded us have, regardless
parents are, neurons control stuff, face, eyes, et
cetera, working together. get stressed, hard us
speak tend jitter kinds things. Just like neurons cause
stress center spinal cord working together get body activated.
Okay, lot science today. now got physiological sigh tool. know
exhale-emphasized breathing will slow heart inhale-emphasized
breathing will speed heart up. So, think something now.

00:40:39 3 Types Stress: Short, Medium Long-Term

think stress not whether not acute chronic, whether not
good us bad us, three different timescales. can arrive
relates emotions. trust me, everything
emotions whether not functioning well emotionally not
functioning well emotionally, whether not coping not coping. So,
typically psychological terms psychological discussions. entering
portal physiology. stuff medical textbooks. will arrive
psychology soon, really want understand difference three
kinds stress three different timescales, short-term, medium-term, long-term,
good bad for. think heard stress bad
us. seen pictures intended frighten us. indeed frightening.
see nice really plump brain left. says healthy control.
see brain says stressed right like withered, see
hippocampus area involved memory smaller. People stressed.
see Alzheimer's brain made worse stress. people
predisposition schizophrenia, get stressed, higher incidence
schizophrenia episodes. hear addicts will relapse stressed.


mean, okay, get it. important, think heard now many
times stress bad.

00:42:10 Positive Effects Short-Term Stress: Immunity Focus

conversation, unfortunately, eclipsed really positive things
stress us short-term. So, stress can short-term, medium-term, long-
term. Long-term stress indeed bad reasons just mentioned many
others. never actually discussed stress terrific for, positive
short-term. think tend overlook important question,
short-term long-term? No one ever bothers tell us chronic,
acute. Right? five minutes? five days? duration final
exams? duration senior thesis college? No one actually draws
boundaries around stuff even general guidelines. so, become bit
mess, frankly, try decipher whole space around stress. So, going try
clean based know scientific data. First
all, acute stress, stress response hits, good immune system.
know might tough pill swallow, absolutely true. fact, stress often
comes form bacterial viral infection. stress response part
organized combat bacterial viral infection. pathways
brain centers activate neurons spinal cord make feel like
want move. neurons brain activate things like spleen,
will deploy killer cells go scavenge incoming bacteria viruses
try eat kill them. So, short-term stress release
adrenaline particular epinephrine, thing, adrenaline epinephrine, good
combating infection. just not discussed enough. So,
discussing here. relates particular tool many ask about,
don't often get opportunity talk appropriate context. not
ever inappropriate talk about, talk now use of,
again, respiration breathing somewhat artificially activate stress response.
will accomplish two things. Okay? return medium long-term stress,
want say short-term stress good dilation pupils, changes
optics eyes, quickening heart rate, sharpening cognition.
fact short-term stress brings certain elements brain online allow


focus. Now, narrows focus. not good seeing so-called big
picture, narrows focus. allows these, call duration path
outcome types analysis. allows evaluate environment, evaluate
need do. primes whole system better cognition. primes immune
system combat infection. makes sense think fact
famine, thirst, bacterial infections, viral infections, invaders, stuff liberates
response body designed get fight back whatever stressor
happens be. Psychological, physical, bacterial, viral. Again, stress response
generic.

00:45:32 Adrenalin (Epinephrine) Deploys Killer Immune Cells

tool takes advantage fact adrenaline released body
adrenals, effect also liberating lot killer cells immune
organs, particular spleen, elsewhere well, interactions
lymphatic system combat infection. way works real world best
captured study can mapped back so-called Wim Hof breathing. Now,
Wim Hof breathing named so-called "Iceman," Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
course, Dutch. He, think self-titled Daredevil. indeed
many, many Guinness Book World Records things like swimming icebergs
going Kilimanjaro shorts crossing desert without water, et cetera.
Things quite dangerous don't know doing. Wim obviously
survived telling survived. two components sort
breathing protocol

00:46:40 Cyclic Deep Breathing Stress: Wim Hof, Tummo & Super-Oxygenation

developed based also called Tummo breathing, T-U-M-M-O.
So, Wim, Tummo breathing. many people call now super
oxygenation breathing. Although breath work aficionados will probably say, well,
not super oxygenation also blowing awful lot carbon dioxide.
talking here, regardless whether not called Wim Hof, Tummo, super
oxygenation, rapid deliberate breathing. So, deliberate hyperventilation.
somebody want this? Well, deliberate hyperventilation done maybe 25 cycles.


inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. Typically, done nose
mouth. Although sometimes just mouth.
15 breaths, 20 breaths, 25 breaths, will feel alert. People anxiety will
feel anxious. might even anxiety attack. However, need ask
kind breathing feels way. pattern breathing, rapid
movements diaphragm will liberate adrenaline adrenals. So,
release adrenaline. mentioned Wim also called "The Iceman." Well,
actually discovered pattern breathing, somewhat. again, maps
back Tummo breathing going cold water. go cold water,
stressor liberate adrenaline response cold water. So, get
ice bath cold shower, will immediately release adrenaline adrenals.
Now, sorts things related psychological control stress
thresholds talk about, really want people understand
adrenaline released body, better position combat infections.
so, whether not breathe quickly cycles 25 breaths regardless
call it, doesn't matter, adrenaline released. take cold shower,
adrenaline released. go ice bath deliberately, even non-
deliberately, adrenaline released. mimicking stress response.
adrenaline serves suppress combat incoming infections. beautifully
shown study published fine journal, "Proceedings
National Academy Sciences US." literally called "Proceedings
National Academy USA" distinguish proceedings national
academies countries. way experiment went people injected
endotoxin cases injected bacterial wall mimics
infection. gives fever. makes feel nauseous. makes feel sick.
not pleasant. Half people particular pattern breathing looked
much like pattern breathing described moment ago 25 deep inhales
exhales followed exhale holding breath. repeating 25 inhales,
exhales holding breath. So, look something like this, listening,
sounds like [inhaling exhaling]. 25, 30 times, start feeling heated up.
start feeling adrenaline response. liberating adrenaline body.
exhale, hold breath 15 seconds repeat. typically,
three four rounds that, inhale deeply hold breath. Now,
want emphasize never ever, ever anywhere near water. People passed


out. So-called shallow water blackout. People died. Don't bathtub. Don't
hot tub. Don't swimming. Please don't anywhere near water.
Please don't all, unless get clearance doctor
pulmonary effects whatnot. breath holds definitely not
done anyone glaucoma pressure concerns eyes. repeated
cycles breathing liberate adrenaline allowed group protocol
essentially experience zero symptoms ejection E. coli,
remarkable. much reduced no symptoms. didn't feel feverish.
didn't feel sick. weren't vomiting, no diarrhea, remarkable, makes total
sense think fact short-term stress response there,
typically called acute stress response,

00:50:58 Inflammation Useful Good, Short Term

designed combat stressors. fact, cut deeply
hike woods, thing happen
rapid inflammation response. always hear inflammation bad. Inflammation
gives us Alzheimer's. Inflammation worst thing. swelling associated,
inflammation associated recruitment things like macrophages microglia
neural tissue. Cells brain body whose job act like little ambulances
rush site clean up. indeed inflammation response looks
horrible, sounds horrible, great thing short-term. want
tissue marked trouble want body brain react it. So,
getting peaks stress time time throughout day throughout week,
better position combat infection. better position heal
wounds, physical wounds. Many great things happen stress response. Now,
course, stress response

00:52:02 Procrastination Self-Manufactured Nootropics

isn't always super intense. Sometimes milder. Sometimes allows us just focus
something deadline. can feel stressful, one
reasons procrastinators there, people always asking can done
procrastination? can done procrastination can understand


happening, self-imposing stress stress acts like drug.
powerful nootropic. get asked nootropics. powerful nootropic
smart drug stress. concern failure. desire well.
impending deadline. the, "Oh gosh, thing now going
fail." best nootropic will ever find. combined good night's
sleep, talk about. spent whole month sleep. So, don't want
backtrack much. Okay. So, short-term stress, great. key able turn
stress response off done, don't want that.

00:53:00 Relaxation Can Causes Illness

fact, just really tamp relationship short-term acute stress
response infection. Many us familiar experience work, work, work,
work, work, taking care loved one, stress, stress, stress, stress, finally
relax. Maybe even go vacation. Like, "Oh, now finally going get break."
get sick. adrenaline response crashed
immune system crashed it. So, please understand this. Now, many might
say, "Well, long? two hours? three hours?" lot really
like specificity, will vary everybody. just kind use rule thumb.
no longer able achieve good sleep, good sleep means you,
please see episodes sleep want tools sleep,
no longer able achieve good sleep, now moving acute stress chronic
stress. need able turn stress response off. one wish, well,
many wishes lifetime, one wish today hope will permeate
spread there, idea need young age, even adults
forever, need learn turn off stress response. Physiological sigh one.
going activate stress response intentionally ice baths, cold showers,
cyclic hyperoxygenated breathing, aka Tummo breathing Wim Hof breathing, also
need learn press brake. Okay? So, think stress system.
knows activate itself.

00:54:30 Immune Activation Protocol

Now talking way deliberately activating stress system order


combat infection. time time. might feel tickle throat like
getting kind run down, will kind breathing. do. will take 25 30 breaths.
Exhale, hold breath. 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold breath 15

don't surprise you, everyone knows getting regular exercise, getting good sleep,
using real-time tools try tamp stress response, et cetera, going
really useful. data really points fact social connection certain


types social connection particular going mitigate reduce long-
term stress. particularly important issue nowadays
proxies surrogates social connection. online texting people lot,
can feel connected. Like plane's take off everyone's texting
whether not fear flying not. like, "Okay, see you. Love
you. Hate you." Whatever trying communicate people. plane
lands, every phone's out, "See you. Love you. Hate you." hope fewer hate yous.
everyone kind need stay connected one another. Humans
incredibly social creatures. Now, way look whole business social

really key. get oxytocin."

01:08:20 Oxytocin Myth

Actually, know connection individuals rarely causes release
oxytocin? Oxytocin released particular circumstances like post-orgasm, baby

01:19:15 Adrenal Burnout Myth… Need Know Anyway

point can become problematic. Now, note adrenal burnout.
actually no thing adrenal burnout normal conditions. adrenals
enough adrenaline support 200 years stress better, worse. concept
adrenal burnout origins work Nobel Prize winner, Hans Selye, actually
discovered called general adaptation syndrome. discovered lot
things stress. phenomenal work turned true.

eventually reach phase called exhaustion. turned wrong. Although
many may feel exhausted chronic stress, isn't really physiological
exhaustion happens. eventually got picked ran general
public. talk adrenal burnout. much coffee, adrenal burnout. hear
stuff. no thing adrenal burnout. adrenals don't burn out.
something, however, called adrenal insufficiency syndrome, real
physiological problem people impaired adrenals can't
produce adrenaline. melatonin taken high levels periods time
long can cause suppression cortisol epinephrine released
adrenals can create kind pseudo adrenal insufficiency syndrome. So, aware
melatonin reason. Please, trying, alone can't get rid phrase adrenal

stress. thing decide look body control mind,
something else powerful. stressed mind body,
feeling really agitated, activated, worried, use tool like
physiological sigh exhale-emphasized breathing, will notice brain
mind becomes available controlling stress response reacting
it. great sweet spot life be, provided not trying
sleep, alert calm. so, idea. alert calm

00:36:50 Cyclic Sighing Calm Sleep Induction

bring back sort plane alertness.
trouble sleeping just relaxing day, physiological sigh can repeated
10, 15 cycles like. people find actually puts sleep. So,
lie reading many these, actually can put
sleep. find breath work protocols, kind stuff
done away real life, set aside time decide quote unquote,
breath work, works inhales longer
vigorous exhales, tends activating alert you.
exhales longer vigorous inhales, tends put sleep.
many protocols laboratories populate
internet wellness sites whatnot, exhale-emphasized breathing, oftentimes
used tool trying teach people fall asleep. Physiological sigh


little different. designed used real time. Just think just kind kit
things can life happens need react life. note
nasal versus mouth breathing, plethora information now

00:37:57 Nasal Breathing Cosmetic, Immune Performance Enhancement

James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science Lost Art," came
last year. Excellent book. well "Jaws" Sandra Kahn, Paul
Ehrlich foreword Jared Diamond Robert Sapolsky. So, collection
people Stanford. Jared Diamond not Stanford, rest are.
heavy hitters book, benefits nasal breathing. many
cases, nasal breathing advantageous mouth breathing sorts
things. Cosmetic features face, especially kids, warding off infection, et cetera.
physiological sigh, best way double inhale
nose, exhale mouth. can't, can
mouth, just mouth. want nose,
nose. anchors back underlying neurology neuroscience.

00:38:46 Two Breathing Centers Brain

So, want know, two breathing centers. One
involved rhythmic breathing inhales followed exhales, followed inhales
followed exhales. so-called pre-Botzinger nucleus named bottle wine
discovered Jack Feldman UCLA nearby nucleus called parafacial
nucleus also discovered Jack Feldman UCLA. parafacial nucleus
involved time double inhales double exhales. designed
breathe speaking can't always go inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale speaking. So, tell this, not overwhelm
knowledge, just know double inhales double
exhales, activating parafacial nucleus. cool effects.
located near neurons control face, also tendency
relax jaw. interplay neurons control speaking stuff
stuff tongue. So, sudden, physiological sigh,
tap neural circuitry allows us



00:39:45 Breathing Speaking Clearly

speak clearly, control muscles face jaw. Maybe means not
saying certain things stressed, just generally relax. so, brings
us back neuroscience parasympathetic nervous system. calming
system genetically encoded us have, regardless
parents are, neurons control stuff, face, eyes, et
cetera, working together. get stressed, hard us
speak tend jitter kinds things. Just like neurons cause
stress center spinal cord working together get body activated.
Okay, lot science today. now got physiological sigh tool. know
exhale-emphasized breathing will slow heart inhale-emphasized
breathing will speed heart up. So, think something now.

00:40:39 3 Types Stress: Short, Medium Long-Term

think stress not whether not acute chronic, whether not
good us bad us, three different timescales. can arrive
relates emotions. trust me, everything
emotions whether not functioning well emotionally not
functioning well emotionally, whether not coping not coping. So,
typically psychological terms psychological discussions. entering
portal physiology. stuff medical textbooks. will arrive
psychology soon, really want understand difference three
kinds stress three different timescales, short-term, medium-term, long-term,
good bad for. think heard stress bad
us. seen pictures intended frighten us. indeed frightening.
see nice really plump brain left. says healthy control.
see brain says stressed right like withered, see
hippocampus area involved memory smaller. People stressed.
see Alzheimer's brain made worse stress. people
predisposition schizophrenia, get stressed, higher incidence
schizophrenia episodes. hear addicts will relapse stressed.


mean, okay, get it. important, think heard now many
times stress bad.

00:42:10 Positive Effects Short-Term Stress: Immunity Focus

conversation, unfortunately, eclipsed really positive things
stress us short-term. So, stress can short-term, medium-term, long-
term. Long-term stress indeed bad reasons just mentioned many
others. never actually discussed stress terrific for, positive
short-term. think tend overlook important question,
short-term long-term? No one ever bothers tell us chronic,
acute. Right? five minutes? five days? duration final
exams? duration senior thesis college? No one actually draws
boundaries around stuff even general guidelines. so, become bit
mess, frankly, try decipher whole space around stress. So, going try
clean based know scientific data. First
all, acute stress, stress response hits, good immune system.
know might tough pill swallow, absolutely true. fact, stress often
comes form bacterial viral infection. stress response part
organized combat bacterial viral infection. pathways
brain centers activate neurons spinal cord make feel like
want move. neurons brain activate things like spleen,
will deploy killer cells go scavenge incoming bacteria viruses
try eat kill them. So, short-term stress release
adrenaline particular epinephrine, thing, adrenaline epinephrine, good
combating infection. just not discussed enough. So,
discussing here. relates particular tool many ask about,
don't often get opportunity talk appropriate context. not
ever inappropriate talk about, talk now use of,
again, respiration breathing somewhat artificially activate stress response.
will accomplish two things. Okay? return medium long-term stress,
want say short-term stress good dilation pupils, changes
optics eyes, quickening heart rate, sharpening cognition.
fact short-term stress brings certain elements brain online allow


focus. Now, narrows focus. not good seeing so-called big
picture, narrows focus. allows these, call duration path
outcome types analysis. allows evaluate environment, evaluate
need do. primes whole system better cognition. primes immune
system combat infection. makes sense think fact
famine, thirst, bacterial infections, viral infections, invaders, stuff liberates
response body designed get fight back whatever stressor
happens be. Psychological, physical, bacterial, viral. Again, stress response
generic.

00:45:32 Adrenalin (Epinephrine) Deploys Killer Immune Cells

tool takes advantage fact adrenaline released body
adrenals, effect also liberating lot killer cells immune
organs, particular spleen, elsewhere well, interactions
lymphatic system combat infection. way works real world best
captured study can mapped back so-called Wim Hof breathing. Now,
Wim Hof breathing named so-called "Iceman," Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
course, Dutch. He, think self-titled Daredevil. indeed
many, many Guinness Book World Records things like swimming icebergs
going Kilimanjaro shorts crossing desert without water, et cetera.
Things quite dangerous don't know doing. Wim obviously
survived telling survived. two components sort
breathing protocol

00:46:40 Cyclic Deep Breathing Stress: Wim Hof, Tummo & Super-Oxygenation

developed based also called Tummo breathing, T-U-M-M-O.
So, Wim, Tummo breathing. many people call now super
oxygenation breathing. Although breath work aficionados will probably say, well,
not super oxygenation also blowing awful lot carbon dioxide.
talking here, regardless whether not called Wim Hof, Tummo, super
oxygenation, rapid deliberate breathing. So, deliberate hyperventilation.
somebody want this? Well, deliberate hyperventilation done maybe 25 cycles.


inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. Typically, done nose
mouth. Although sometimes just mouth.
15 breaths, 20 breaths, 25 breaths, will feel alert. People anxiety will
feel anxious. might even anxiety attack. However, need ask
kind breathing feels way. pattern breathing, rapid
movements diaphragm will liberate adrenaline adrenals. So,
release adrenaline. mentioned Wim also called "The Iceman." Well,
actually discovered pattern breathing, somewhat. again, maps
back Tummo breathing going cold water. go cold water,
stressor liberate adrenaline response cold water. So, get
ice bath cold shower, will immediately release adrenaline adrenals.
Now, sorts things related psychological control stress
thresholds talk about, really want people understand
adrenaline released body, better position combat infections.
so, whether not breathe quickly cycles 25 breaths regardless
call it, doesn't matter, adrenaline released. take cold shower,
adrenaline released. go ice bath deliberately, even non-
deliberately, adrenaline released. mimicking stress response.
adrenaline serves suppress combat incoming infections. beautifully
shown study published fine journal, "Proceedings
National Academy Sciences US." literally called "Proceedings
National Academy USA" distinguish proceedings national
academies countries. way experiment went people injected
endotoxin cases injected bacterial wall mimics
infection. gives fever. makes feel nauseous. makes feel sick.
not pleasant. Half people particular pattern breathing looked
much like pattern breathing described moment ago 25 deep inhales
exhales followed exhale holding breath. repeating 25 inhales,
exhales holding breath. So, look something like this, listening,
sounds like [inhaling exhaling]. 25, 30 times, start feeling heated up.
start feeling adrenaline response. liberating adrenaline body.
exhale, hold breath 15 seconds repeat. typically,
three four rounds that, inhale deeply hold breath. Now,
want emphasize never ever, ever anywhere near water. People passed


out. So-called shallow water blackout. People died. Don't bathtub. Don't
hot tub. Don't swimming. Please don't anywhere near water.
Please don't all, unless get clearance doctor

cycles breathing liberate adrenaline allowed group protocol
essentially experience zero symptoms ejection E. coli,
remarkable. much reduced no symptoms. didn't feel feverish.
didn't feel sick. weren't vomiting, no diarrhea, remarkable, makes total
sense think fact short-term stress response there,
typically called acute stress response,

00:50:58 Inflammation Useful Good, Short Term

designed combat stressors. fact, cut deeply
hike woods, thing happen
rapid inflammation response. always hear inflammation bad. Inflammation
gives us Alzheimer's. Inflammation worst thing. swelling associated,
inflammation associated recruitment things like macrophages microglia
neural tissue. Cells brain body whose job act like little ambulances
rush site clean up. indeed inflammation response looks
horrible, sounds horrible, great thing short-term. want
tissue marked trouble want body brain react it. So,
getting peaks stress time time throughout day throughout week,
better position combat infection. better position heal
wounds, physical wounds. Many great things happen stress response. Now,
course, stress response

00:52:02 Procrastination Self-Manufactured Nootropics

isn't always super intense. Sometimes milder. Sometimes allows us just focus
something deadline. can feel stressful, one
reasons procrastinators there, people always asking can done

backtrack much. Okay. So, short-term stress, great. key able turn
stress response off done, don't want that.

00:53:00 Relaxation Can Causes Illness

fact, just really tamp relationship short-term acute stress
response infection. Many us familiar experience work, work, work,
work, work, taking care loved one, stress, stress, stress, stress, finally
relax. Maybe even go vacation. Like, "Oh, now finally going get break."
get sick. adrenaline response crashed
immune system crashed it. So, please understand this. Now, many might
say, "Well, long? two hours? three hours?" lot really
like specificity, will vary everybody. just kind use rule thumb.
no longer able achieve good sleep, good sleep means you,
please see episodes sleep want tools sleep,

forever, need learn turn off stress response. Physiological sigh one.
going activate stress response intentionally ice baths, cold showers,
cyclic hyperoxygenated breathing, aka Tummo breathing Wim Hof breathing, also
need learn press brake. Okay? So, think stress system.
knows activate itself.

00:54:30 Immune Activation Protocol

Now talking way deliberately activating stress system order


combat infection. time time. might feel tickle throat like

Exhale, hold breath. 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold breath 15

inhale. hold breath feel impulse breathe. Again, feel safe

this. people like ice bath. rarely ice bath. people like
cold showers. like hot showers. So, take hot showers, kind breathing.
Again, less effect

00:55:20 Medium Term Stress: Clear Definition

Medium-term stress going stress lasts anywhere several days

01:06:30 Tools Dealing Long Term Stress

years end. best tools, best mechanisms know modulate long-
term stress might surprise little bit. First all, going things
don't surprise you, everyone knows getting regular exercise, getting good sleep,
using real-time tools try tamp stress response, et cetera, going
really useful. data really points fact social connection certain


types social connection particular going mitigate reduce long-
term stress. particularly important issue nowadays
proxies surrogates social connection. online texting people lot,
can feel connected. Like plane's take off everyone's texting
whether not fear flying not. like, "Okay, see you. Love
you. Hate you." Whatever trying communicate people. plane
lands, every phone's out, "See you. Love you. Hate you." hope fewer hate yous.
everyone kind need stay connected one another. Humans
incredibly social creatures. Now, way look whole business social

01:19:15 Adrenal Burnout Myth… Need Know Anyway

point can become problematic. Now, note adrenal burnout.
actually no thing adrenal burnout normal conditions. adrenals
enough adrenaline support 200 years stress better, worse. concept
adrenal burnout origins work Nobel Prize winner, Hans Selye, actually
discovered called general adaptation syndrome. discovered lot
things stress. phenomenal work turned true.

discussion. theory stress went long enough,
eventually reach phase called exhaustion. turned wrong. Although
many may feel exhausted chronic stress, isn't really physiological
exhaustion happens. eventually got picked ran general
public. talk adrenal burnout. much coffee, adrenal burnout. hear
stuff. no thing adrenal burnout. adrenals don't burn out.
something, however, called adrenal insufficiency syndrome, real
physiological problem people impaired adrenals can't
produce adrenaline. melatonin taken high levels periods time
long can cause suppression cortisol epinephrine released
adrenals can create kind pseudo adrenal insufficiency syndrome. So, aware
melatonin reason. Please, trying, alone can't get rid phrase adrenal

Keep taurine companies business. not me. like people know
may may not them. supplement can useful
ashwagandha. Ashwagandha known lower anxiety cortisol. six,
are, excuse me, six studies collectively show reductions cortisol, cortisol
typically associated waking morning, good. healthy,
brief cortisol bump goes away provided getting light right time
days correct times day, like morning evening. don't want cortisol
chronically elevated. associated bad stuff stress.
strong effect ashwagandha. can find dosages examine.com. report
across six studies, 14.5 27.9 reduction cortisol otherwise healthy, stressed
individuals. Now, don't know kids. look says various
supplements. things done adults. So, please check carefully.
great. mean, opportunity anyway, able take something
can help reduce cortisol don't get long-term effects
stress. not going take ashwagandha year round.
feeling like wasn't managing short medium-term stress well. So, don't take
regular basis. take times things particularly
stressful. five studies show reduced stress. So, not cortisol
measurements, things like fatigue, cognitive impairment, et cetera. lower total
cholesterol, may may not good bad 10%. So, people
don't want cholesterol lowered. people might. Cholesterol, talk
month hormones, cholesterol molecule testosterone
estrogen cortisol matter synthesized. So, don't want get
cholesterol low, sorts negative effects, don't want
high either. Mild effects good clinical studies reducing depression, probably

01:26:20 Relates Emotions: State Versus Demand = Valence

now finally position talk set
beginning, spend month emotions. important discuss
stress discuss context short, medium, long-term stress.
discuss tools short-term, medium-term, long-term control. don't really want
say mitigation stress. Stress going happen. ability modulate
control stress real time offline using tools respiration, using tools

take care sleep nutrition exercise. Again, tons resources
information sleep episodes. So, can look there. will month
hormones, exercise, et cetera. talk emotions subsequent
episodes, going talk OCD, going talk depression,
going talk mania, going talking dopamine sorts
things. core emotions question, emotion? Well,
complex. isn't single brain area one things call
emotions. framework, think modern science, psychology
neuroscience pretty well-aligned Lisa Feldman Barrett taught about.
Now, Lisa's Northeastern University. runs big lab there. world expert
emotion. written two books really wonderful. One "How Emotions
Made," first book. second one "Seven Half Facts
Brain." wonderful book well. came recently. hosted Lisa
Instagram live once. Maybe get podcast lucky. don't
agree everything neuroscience emotions, subscribed
everything heard Lisa say. particular, fact emotions context-
dependent. cultural dependence, et cetera. look things mainly
lens physiology neuroscience kind low-level circuitry. one way think
emotions think consistent think Lisa generally approve, can't
speak her, hope generally approve description,


internal state stress calm matches demands us mismatched
demands us, tend interpret good bad. Let give
example. feeling anxious, stressed inside, lot do,
doesn't feel good, really no different tired lot
mismatch. not right internal state, internal state
incorrect rather, meet demands placed upon me. So, cases,
whether tired stressed need do, valence, meaning
value assigned don't feel good. not good situation don't
feel good. Now, might call stressed, might call anxious, might call worried,
might call number things, not good. However, tired want
fall asleep, well feel good demand is. need go sleep
tired. wide awake need fall asleep, not good.
brain tends go direction interpreting situation bad one. So,
discussion around emotions far nuanced elaborate this,
one way think relationship emotions whether not internal state
matching demands upon you. So, way, don't really place
much value whether not feeling alert sleepy. place value
whether not alertness whether not full-blown stress not sleepiness,
whether not falling asleep just little bit drowsy, whether not matches
conditions face. useful framework have. reason

01:34:00 Next Steps

controlling internal landscape. So, think set stage
headed next, talk things normally think
think emotions, like happiness, like awe, like joy. will get
that. rests firmly foundation thing call
autonomic nervous system. stress modulation. calming modulation system.
again, whether not activated calm not good bad, depends
situation. Certainly, want fall asleep, activated isn't good.
work do, activated great. So, hope today able
take slightly different view thing call stress. Not just see evil,
see powerful useful certain contexts. Great us certain contexts
problematic contexts. well think various tools
presented can allow adjust modulate internal levels alertness
calmness can lean effectively life, includes sleep social
connection work do. course, acknowledges events
world beyond control. control react them.
Something commonly said wellness self-help psychology world,
often aren't many concrete tools can really look trust

very, fast.

00:34:53 Important Notes Heart Rate Deceleration: Vaso-vagal Lag

far know, fastest way accomplish that. important note
physiological sigh exhale-emphasized breathing lowering stress response.
Many people worry heart rate not come fast enough. want tell


not want heart rate reduce fast. actually something
called vasovagal response, people will stand get middle
night use bathroom sudden, collapse, faint.
heart rate reduced much. people will see blood
see something really troubling stressful pass out. over-
activation acceleration calming response. not stressed
kind fall off cliff stress. get stressed rebound mechanism
calming goes high, fast. calmed fast
collapse faint. so, aware going use physiological sigh
exhale-emphasized breathing calm down, heart rate will take 20 30
seconds come baseline. may need repeat physiological sigh
times. So, important note use breathing control levels
stress. thing decide look body control mind,
something else powerful. stressed mind body,
feeling really agitated, activated, worried, use tool like
physiological sigh exhale-emphasized breathing, will notice brain
mind becomes available controlling stress response reacting
it. great sweet spot life be, provided not trying

00:36:50 Cyclic Sighing Calm Sleep Induction

bring back sort plane alertness.
trouble sleeping just relaxing day, physiological sigh can repeated
10, 15 cycles like. people find actually puts sleep. So,
lie reading many these, actually can put

used tool trying teach people fall asleep. Physiological sigh


little different. designed used real time. Just think just kind kit
things can life happens need react life. note
nasal versus mouth breathing, plethora information now

00:37:57 Nasal Breathing Cosmetic, Immune Performance Enhancement

James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science Lost Art," came
last year. Excellent book. well "Jaws" Sandra Kahn, Paul
Ehrlich foreword Jared Diamond Robert Sapolsky. So, collection
people Stanford. Jared Diamond not Stanford, rest are.
heavy hitters book, benefits nasal breathing. many
cases, nasal breathing advantageous mouth breathing sorts
things. Cosmetic features face, especially kids, warding off infection, et cetera.
physiological sigh, best way double inhale
nose, exhale mouth. can't, can
mouth, just mouth. want nose,
nose. anchors back underlying neurology neuroscience.

00:38:46 Two Breathing Centers Brain

So, want know, two breathing centers. One
involved rhythmic breathing inhales followed exhales, followed inhales
followed exhales. so-called pre-Botzinger nucleus named bottle wine
discovered Jack Feldman UCLA nearby nucleus called parafacial
nucleus also discovered Jack Feldman UCLA. parafacial nucleus
involved time double inhales double exhales. designed
breathe speaking can't always go inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale speaking. So, tell this, not overwhelm
knowledge, just know double inhales double
exhales, activating parafacial nucleus. cool effects.
located near neurons control face, also tendency
relax jaw. interplay neurons control speaking stuff
stuff tongue. So, sudden, physiological sigh,
tap neural circuitry allows us



00:39:45 Breathing Speaking Clearly

speak clearly, control muscles face jaw. Maybe means not
saying certain things stressed, just generally relax. so, brings
us back neuroscience parasympathetic nervous system. calming
system genetically encoded us have, regardless
parents are, neurons control stuff, face, eyes, et
cetera, working together. get stressed, hard us
speak tend jitter kinds things. Just like neurons cause
stress center spinal cord working together get body activated.
Okay, lot science today. now got physiological sigh tool. know
exhale-emphasized breathing will slow heart inhale-emphasized
breathing will speed heart up. So, think something now.

00:40:39 3 Types Stress: Short, Medium Long-Term

think stress not whether not acute chronic, whether not
good us bad us, three different timescales. can arrive
relates emotions. trust me, everything
emotions whether not functioning well emotionally not
functioning well emotionally, whether not coping not coping. So,
typically psychological terms psychological discussions. entering
portal physiology. stuff medical textbooks. will arrive
psychology soon, really want understand difference three
kinds stress three different timescales, short-term, medium-term, long-term,
good bad for. think heard stress bad
us. seen pictures intended frighten us. indeed frightening.
see nice really plump brain left. says healthy control.
see brain says stressed right like withered, see
hippocampus area involved memory smaller. People stressed.
see Alzheimer's brain made worse stress. people
predisposition schizophrenia, get stressed, higher incidence
schizophrenia episodes. hear addicts will relapse stressed.


mean, okay, get it. important, think heard now many
times stress bad.

00:42:10 Positive Effects Short-Term Stress: Immunity Focus

conversation, unfortunately, eclipsed really positive things
stress us short-term. So, stress can short-term, medium-term, long-
term. Long-term stress indeed bad reasons just mentioned many
others. never actually discussed stress terrific for, positive
short-term. think tend overlook important question,
short-term long-term? No one ever bothers tell us chronic,
acute. Right? five minutes? five days? duration final
exams? duration senior thesis college? No one actually draws
boundaries around stuff even general guidelines. so, become bit
mess, frankly, try decipher whole space around stress. So, going try
clean based know scientific data. First
all, acute stress, stress response hits, good immune system.
know might tough pill swallow, absolutely true. fact, stress often
comes form bacterial viral infection. stress response part
organized combat bacterial viral infection. pathways
brain centers activate neurons spinal cord make feel like
want move. neurons brain activate things like spleen,
will deploy killer cells go scavenge incoming bacteria viruses
try eat kill them. So, short-term stress release
adrenaline particular epinephrine, thing, adrenaline epinephrine, good
combating infection. just not discussed enough. So,
discussing here. relates particular tool many ask about,
don't often get opportunity talk appropriate context. not
ever inappropriate talk about, talk now use of,
again, respiration breathing somewhat artificially activate stress response.
will accomplish two things. Okay? return medium long-term stress,
want say short-term stress good dilation pupils, changes
optics eyes, quickening heart rate, sharpening cognition.
fact short-term stress brings certain elements brain online allow


focus. Now, narrows focus. not good seeing so-called big
picture, narrows focus. allows these, call duration path
outcome types analysis. allows evaluate environment, evaluate
need do. primes whole system better cognition. primes immune
system combat infection. makes sense think fact
famine, thirst, bacterial infections, viral infections, invaders, stuff liberates
response body designed get fight back whatever stressor
happens be. Psychological, physical, bacterial, viral. Again, stress response
generic.

00:45:32 Adrenalin (Epinephrine) Deploys Killer Immune Cells

tool takes advantage fact adrenaline released body
adrenals, effect also liberating lot killer cells immune
organs, particular spleen, elsewhere well, interactions
lymphatic system combat infection. way works real world best
captured study can mapped back so-called Wim Hof breathing. Now,
Wim Hof breathing named so-called "Iceman," Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
course, Dutch. He, think self-titled Daredevil. indeed
many, many Guinness Book World Records things like swimming icebergs
going Kilimanjaro shorts crossing desert without water, et cetera.
Things quite dangerous don't know doing. Wim obviously
survived telling survived. two components sort
breathing protocol

00:46:40 Cyclic Deep Breathing Stress: Wim Hof, Tummo & Super-Oxygenation

developed based also called Tummo breathing, T-U-M-M-O.
So, Wim, Tummo breathing. many people call now super
oxygenation breathing. Although breath work aficionados will probably say, well,
not super oxygenation also blowing awful lot carbon dioxide.
talking here, regardless whether not called Wim Hof, Tummo, super
oxygenation, rapid deliberate breathing. So, deliberate hyperventilation.
somebody want this? Well, deliberate hyperventilation done maybe 25 cycles.


inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. Typically, done nose
mouth. Although sometimes just mouth.
15 breaths, 20 breaths, 25 breaths, will feel alert. People anxiety will
feel anxious. might even anxiety attack. However, need ask
kind breathing feels way. pattern breathing, rapid
movements diaphragm will liberate adrenaline adrenals. So,
release adrenaline. mentioned Wim also called "The Iceman." Well,
actually discovered pattern breathing, somewhat. again, maps
back Tummo breathing going cold water. go cold water,
stressor liberate adrenaline response cold water. So, get
ice bath cold shower, will immediately release adrenaline adrenals.
Now, sorts things related psychological control stress
thresholds talk about, really want people understand
adrenaline released body, better position combat infections.
so, whether not breathe quickly cycles 25 breaths regardless
call it, doesn't matter, adrenaline released. take cold shower,
adrenaline released. go ice bath deliberately, even non-
deliberately, adrenaline released. mimicking stress response.
adrenaline serves suppress combat incoming infections. beautifully
shown study published fine journal, "Proceedings
National Academy Sciences US." literally called "Proceedings
National Academy USA" distinguish proceedings national
academies countries. way experiment went people injected
endotoxin cases injected bacterial wall mimics
infection. gives fever. makes feel nauseous. makes feel sick.
not pleasant. Half people particular pattern breathing looked
much like pattern breathing described moment ago 25 deep inhales
exhales followed exhale holding breath. repeating 25 inhales,
exhales holding breath. So, look something like this, listening,
sounds like [inhaling exhaling]. 25, 30 times, start feeling heated up.
start feeling adrenaline response. liberating adrenaline body.
exhale, hold breath 15 seconds repeat. typically,
three four rounds that, inhale deeply hold breath. Now,
want emphasize never ever, ever anywhere near water. People passed


out. So-called shallow water blackout. People died. Don't bathtub. Don't
hot tub. Don't swimming. Please don't anywhere near water.
Please don't all, unless get clearance doctor
pulmonary effects whatnot. breath holds definitely not
done anyone glaucoma pressure concerns eyes. repeated
cycles breathing liberate adrenaline allowed group protocol
essentially experience zero symptoms ejection E. coli,
remarkable. much reduced no symptoms. didn't feel feverish.
didn't feel sick. weren't vomiting, no diarrhea, remarkable, makes total
sense think fact short-term stress response there,
typically called acute stress response,

00:50:58 Inflammation Useful Good, Short Term

designed combat stressors. fact, cut deeply
hike woods, thing happen
rapid inflammation response. always hear inflammation bad. Inflammation
gives us Alzheimer's. Inflammation worst thing. swelling associated,
inflammation associated recruitment things like macrophages microglia
neural tissue. Cells brain body whose job act like little ambulances
rush site clean up. indeed inflammation response looks
horrible, sounds horrible, great thing short-term. want
tissue marked trouble want body brain react it. So,
getting peaks stress time time throughout day throughout week,
better position combat infection. better position heal
wounds, physical wounds. Many great things happen stress response. Now,
course, stress response

00:52:02 Procrastination Self-Manufactured Nootropics

isn't always super intense. Sometimes milder. Sometimes allows us just focus
something deadline. can feel stressful, one
reasons procrastinators there, people always asking can done
procrastination? can done procrastination can understand


happening, self-imposing stress stress acts like drug.
powerful nootropic. get asked nootropics. powerful nootropic
smart drug stress. concern failure. desire well.
impending deadline. the, "Oh gosh, thing now going
fail." best nootropic will ever find. combined good night's
sleep, talk about. spent whole month sleep. So, don't want
backtrack much. Okay. So, short-term stress, great. key able turn
stress response off done, don't want that.

00:53:00 Relaxation Can Causes Illness

fact, just really tamp relationship short-term acute stress
response infection. Many us familiar experience work, work, work,
work, work, taking care loved one, stress, stress, stress, stress, finally
relax. Maybe even go vacation. Like, "Oh, now finally going get break."
get sick. adrenaline response crashed
immune system crashed it. So, please understand this. Now, many might
say, "Well, long? two hours? three hours?" lot really
like specificity, will vary everybody. just kind use rule thumb.
no longer able achieve good sleep, good sleep means you,
please see episodes sleep want tools sleep,
no longer able achieve good sleep, now moving acute stress chronic
stress. need able turn stress response off. one wish, well,
many wishes lifetime, one wish today hope will permeate
spread there, idea need young age, even adults
forever, need learn turn off stress response. Physiological sigh one.
going activate stress response intentionally ice baths, cold showers,
cyclic hyperoxygenated breathing, aka Tummo breathing Wim Hof breathing, also
need learn press brake. Okay? So, think stress system.
knows activate itself.

00:54:30 Immune Activation Protocol

Now talking way deliberately activating stress system order


combat infection. time time. might feel tickle throat like
getting kind run down, will kind breathing. do. will take 25 30 breaths.
Exhale, hold breath. 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold breath 15
seconds. 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold breath 25 30 seconds. big
inhale. hold breath feel impulse breathe. Again, feel safe
me. run doctor, fine. not unless right you.
this. people like ice bath. rarely ice bath. people like
cold showers. like hot showers. So, take hot showers, kind breathing.
Again, less effect

00:55:20 Medium Term Stress: Clear Definition

increasing adrenaline, allows combat infection
activating immune response. Okay. So, now talk medium-term stress.
Medium-term stress going stress lasts anywhere several days
several weeks. Okay. might think long-term stress. times life
just dealing lot. Okay? particular quarter, happened

00:56:07 Stress Threshold

medium-term stress? stress threshold? Well, stress threshold
actually ability cognitive re-regulate going body. So, hear

01:04:36 Long Term Stress: Definition, Measurement, Cardiovascular Risks

Zero-cost tools. Okay, talk long-term stress. Earlier, talked
breathing can modulate heart rate loop includes brain
parasympathetic nervous system. don't think mentioned this, want make sure
mentioned breathing controlling heart rate sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system basis called HRV, heart rate variability.
know heart rate variability good. don't want heart rate
chronically elevated chronically low. lot people think, "Oh, want really nice low
heart rate." indeed, shape, stroke volume heart will greater
can nice slow heart rate. Years ago running regularly, think
heart rate like 50 60 something like that. great. But,
now higher running little bit less. everyone needs
determine right them. don't really want heart rate
chronically low chronically high. bad. know chronic stress, elevated
stress especially so-called type personalities creates heart disease,
leading killer most, every country, particular US. way
adrenaline impacts blood vessels constricting dilating others,
just kind hypertension, chronic hypertension just bad. so, chronic stress
truly bad. want really make clear emphasized lot
positive effects stress. want able tamp stress real

stress body medium-term, no means want stressed
time, chronically months months months

01:06:30 Tools Dealing Long Term Stress

years end. best tools, best mechanisms know modulate long-
term stress might surprise little bit. First all, going things
don't surprise you, everyone knows getting regular exercise, getting good sleep,
using real-time tools try tamp stress response, et cetera, going
really useful. data really points fact social connection certain

term stress. particularly important issue nowadays
proxies surrogates social connection. online texting people lot,
can feel connected. Like plane's take off everyone's texting
whether not fear flying not. like, "Okay, see you. Love
you. Hate you." Whatever trying communicate people. plane
lands, every phone's out, "See you. Love you. Hate you." hope fewer hate yous.
everyone kind need stay connected one another. Humans
incredibly social creatures. Now, way look whole business social
connection, not just kind wishy-washy new agey perspective. want

just, goal always put scientific data neurochemistry things
wishy-washy new agey stuff, also can arm

really key. get oxytocin."

01:08:20 Oxytocin Myth

Actually, know connection individuals rarely causes release
oxytocin? Oxytocin released particular circumstances like post-orgasm, baby
mother milk let down. associated kind really intense kinds pair bonding

"Hi, great see you," fist bump. not situation oxytocin. way think
social connection can mitigate long-term effects stress
really systems neuromodulation

01:09:15 Serotonin: Satiety, Safety

like serotonin, blocking certain things really bad us feel
socially isolated. Things like Taqi Kynan. So, let explain are. Serotonin


again, neuromodulator. Neuromodulators little bit like playlists brain.

01:12:00 Delight Flexibility



or, "Nobody wants engage socially anymore." first admit, social

01:19:15 Adrenal Burnout Myth… Need Know Anyway

point can become problematic. Now, note adrenal burnout.
actually no thing adrenal burnout normal conditions. adrenals

adrenal burnout origins work Nobel Prize winner, Hans Selye, actually
discovered called general adaptation syndrome. discovered lot

many may feel exhausted chronic stress, isn't really physiological
exhaustion happens. eventually got picked ran general

something, however, called adrenal insufficiency syndrome, real
physiological problem people impaired adrenals can't

internal state stress calm matches demands us mismatched
demands us, tend interpret good bad. Let give
example. feeling anxious, stressed inside, lot do,
doesn't feel good, really no different tired lot
mismatch. not right internal state, internal state
incorrect rather, meet demands placed upon me. So, cases,
whether tired stressed need do, valence, meaning

might call number things, not good. However, tired want
fall asleep, well feel good demand is. need go sleep
tired. wide awake need fall asleep, not good.
brain tends go direction interpreting situation bad one. So,
discussion around emotions far nuanced elaborate this,
one way think relationship emotions whether not internal state
matching demands upon you. So, way, don't really place
much value whether not feeling alert sleepy. place value
whether not alertness whether not full-blown stress not sleepiness,
whether not falling asleep just little bit drowsy, whether not matches

again, whether not activated calm not good bad, depends
situation. Certainly, want fall asleep, activated isn't good.
work do, activated great. So, hope today able
take slightly different view thing call stress. Not just see evil,
see powerful useful certain contexts. Great us certain contexts

Something commonly said wellness self-help psychology world,
often aren't many concrete tools can really look trust

little different. designed used real time. Just think just kind kit
things can life happens need react life. note
nasal versus mouth breathing, plethora information now

00:37:57 Nasal Breathing Cosmetic, Immune Performance Enhancement

James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science Lost Art," came
last year. Excellent book. well "Jaws" Sandra Kahn, Paul
Ehrlich foreword Jared Diamond Robert Sapolsky. So, collection
people Stanford. Jared Diamond not Stanford, rest are.
heavy hitters book, benefits nasal breathing. many
cases, nasal breathing advantageous mouth breathing sorts
things. Cosmetic features face, especially kids, warding off infection, et cetera.
physiological sigh, best way double inhale
nose, exhale mouth. can't, can
mouth, just mouth. want nose,
nose. anchors back underlying neurology neuroscience.

00:38:46 Two Breathing Centers Brain

So, want know, two breathing centers. One
involved rhythmic breathing inhales followed exhales, followed inhales
followed exhales. so-called pre-Botzinger nucleus named bottle wine
discovered Jack Feldman UCLA nearby nucleus called parafacial
nucleus also discovered Jack Feldman UCLA. parafacial nucleus
involved time double inhales double exhales. designed
breathe speaking can't always go inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale speaking. So, tell this, not overwhelm
knowledge, just know double inhales double
exhales, activating parafacial nucleus. cool effects.
located near neurons control face, also tendency
relax jaw. interplay neurons control speaking stuff
stuff tongue. So, sudden, physiological sigh,
tap neural circuitry allows us



00:39:45 Breathing Speaking Clearly

speak clearly, control muscles face jaw. Maybe means not
saying certain things stressed, just generally relax. so, brings
us back neuroscience parasympathetic nervous system. calming
system genetically encoded us have, regardless
parents are, neurons control stuff, face, eyes, et
cetera, working together. get stressed, hard us
speak tend jitter kinds things. Just like neurons cause
stress center spinal cord working together get body activated.
Okay, lot science today. now got physiological sigh tool. know
exhale-emphasized breathing will slow heart inhale-emphasized
breathing will speed heart up. So, think something now.

00:40:39 3 Types Stress: Short, Medium Long-Term

think stress not whether not acute chronic, whether not
good us bad us, three different timescales. can arrive
relates emotions. trust me, everything
emotions whether not functioning well emotionally not
functioning well emotionally, whether not coping not coping. So,
typically psychological terms psychological discussions. entering
portal physiology. stuff medical textbooks. will arrive
psychology soon, really want understand difference three
kinds stress three different timescales, short-term, medium-term, long-term,
good bad for. think heard stress bad
us. seen pictures intended frighten us. indeed frightening.
see nice really plump brain left. says healthy control.
see brain says stressed right like withered, see
hippocampus area involved memory smaller. People stressed.
see Alzheimer's brain made worse stress. people
predisposition schizophrenia, get stressed, higher incidence
schizophrenia episodes. hear addicts will relapse stressed.


mean, okay, get it. important, think heard now many
times stress bad.

00:42:10 Positive Effects Short-Term Stress: Immunity Focus

conversation, unfortunately, eclipsed really positive things
stress us short-term. So, stress can short-term, medium-term, long-
term. Long-term stress indeed bad reasons just mentioned many
others. never actually discussed stress terrific for, positive
short-term. think tend overlook important question,
short-term long-term? No one ever bothers tell us chronic,
acute. Right? five minutes? five days? duration final
exams? duration senior thesis college? No one actually draws
boundaries around stuff even general guidelines. so, become bit
mess, frankly, try decipher whole space around stress. So, going try
clean based know scientific data. First
all, acute stress, stress response hits, good immune system.
know might tough pill swallow, absolutely true. fact, stress often
comes form bacterial viral infection. stress response part
organized combat bacterial viral infection. pathways
brain centers activate neurons spinal cord make feel like
want move. neurons brain activate things like spleen,
will deploy killer cells go scavenge incoming bacteria viruses
try eat kill them. So, short-term stress release
adrenaline particular epinephrine, thing, adrenaline epinephrine, good
combating infection. just not discussed enough. So,
discussing here. relates particular tool many ask about,
don't often get opportunity talk appropriate context. not
ever inappropriate talk about, talk now use of,
again, respiration breathing somewhat artificially activate stress response.
will accomplish two things. Okay? return medium long-term stress,
want say short-term stress good dilation pupils, changes
optics eyes, quickening heart rate, sharpening cognition.
fact short-term stress brings certain elements brain online allow


focus. Now, narrows focus. not good seeing so-called big
picture, narrows focus. allows these, call duration path
outcome types analysis. allows evaluate environment, evaluate
need do. primes whole system better cognition. primes immune
system combat infection. makes sense think fact
famine, thirst, bacterial infections, viral infections, invaders, stuff liberates
response body designed get fight back whatever stressor
happens be. Psychological, physical, bacterial, viral. Again, stress response
generic.

00:45:32 Adrenalin (Epinephrine) Deploys Killer Immune Cells

tool takes advantage fact adrenaline released body
adrenals, effect also liberating lot killer cells immune
organs, particular spleen, elsewhere well, interactions
lymphatic system combat infection. way works real world best
captured study can mapped back so-called Wim Hof breathing. Now,
Wim Hof breathing named so-called "Iceman," Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
course, Dutch. He, think self-titled Daredevil. indeed
many, many Guinness Book World Records things like swimming icebergs
going Kilimanjaro shorts crossing desert without water, et cetera.
Things quite dangerous don't know doing. Wim obviously
survived telling survived. two components sort
breathing protocol

00:46:40 Cyclic Deep Breathing Stress: Wim Hof, Tummo & Super-Oxygenation

developed based also called Tummo breathing, T-U-M-M-O.
So, Wim, Tummo breathing. many people call now super
oxygenation breathing. Although breath work aficionados will probably say, well,
not super oxygenation also blowing awful lot carbon dioxide.
talking here, regardless whether not called Wim Hof, Tummo, super
oxygenation, rapid deliberate breathing. So, deliberate hyperventilation.
somebody want this? Well, deliberate hyperventilation done maybe 25 cycles.


inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. Typically, done nose
mouth. Although sometimes just mouth.
15 breaths, 20 breaths, 25 breaths, will feel alert. People anxiety will
feel anxious. might even anxiety attack. However, need ask
kind breathing feels way. pattern breathing, rapid
movements diaphragm will liberate adrenaline adrenals. So,
release adrenaline. mentioned Wim also called "The Iceman." Well,
actually discovered pattern breathing, somewhat. again, maps
back Tummo breathing going cold water. go cold water,
stressor liberate adrenaline response cold water. So, get
ice bath cold shower, will immediately release adrenaline adrenals.
Now, sorts things related psychological control stress
thresholds talk about, really want people understand
adrenaline released body, better position combat infections.
so, whether not breathe quickly cycles 25 breaths regardless
call it, doesn't matter, adrenaline released. take cold shower,
adrenaline released. go ice bath deliberately, even non-
deliberately, adrenaline released. mimicking stress response.
adrenaline serves suppress combat incoming infections. beautifully
shown study published fine journal, "Proceedings
National Academy Sciences US." literally called "Proceedings
National Academy USA" distinguish proceedings national
academies countries. way experiment went people injected
endotoxin cases injected bacterial wall mimics
infection. gives fever. makes feel nauseous. makes feel sick.
not pleasant. Half people particular pattern breathing looked
much like pattern breathing described moment ago 25 deep inhales
exhales followed exhale holding breath. repeating 25 inhales,
exhales holding breath. So, look something like this, listening,
sounds like [inhaling exhaling]. 25, 30 times, start feeling heated up.
start feeling adrenaline response. liberating adrenaline body.
exhale, hold breath 15 seconds repeat. typically,
three four rounds that, inhale deeply hold breath. Now,
want emphasize never ever, ever anywhere near water. People passed


out. So-called shallow water blackout. People died. Don't bathtub. Don't
hot tub. Don't swimming. Please don't anywhere near water.
Please don't all, unless get clearance doctor
pulmonary effects whatnot. breath holds definitely not
done anyone glaucoma pressure concerns eyes. repeated
cycles breathing liberate adrenaline allowed group protocol
essentially experience zero symptoms ejection E. coli,
remarkable. much reduced no symptoms. didn't feel feverish.
didn't feel sick. weren't vomiting, no diarrhea, remarkable, makes total
sense think fact short-term stress response there,
typically called acute stress response,

00:50:58 Inflammation Useful Good, Short Term

designed combat stressors. fact, cut deeply
hike woods, thing happen
rapid inflammation response. always hear inflammation bad. Inflammation
gives us Alzheimer's. Inflammation worst thing. swelling associated,
inflammation associated recruitment things like macrophages microglia
neural tissue. Cells brain body whose job act like little ambulances
rush site clean up. indeed inflammation response looks
horrible, sounds horrible, great thing short-term. want
tissue marked trouble want body brain react it. So,
getting peaks stress time time throughout day throughout week,
better position combat infection. better position heal
wounds, physical wounds. Many great things happen stress response. Now,
course, stress response

00:52:02 Procrastination Self-Manufactured Nootropics

isn't always super intense. Sometimes milder. Sometimes allows us just focus
something deadline. can feel stressful, one
reasons procrastinators there, people always asking can done
procrastination? can done procrastination can understand


happening, self-imposing stress stress acts like drug.
powerful nootropic. get asked nootropics. powerful nootropic
smart drug stress. concern failure. desire well.

01:06:30 Tools Dealing Long Term Stress

years end. best tools, best mechanisms know modulate long-
term stress might surprise little bit. First all, going things
don't surprise you, everyone knows getting regular exercise, getting good sleep,
using real-time tools try tamp stress response, et cetera, going
really useful. data really points fact social connection certain


types social connection particular going mitigate reduce long-
term stress. particularly important issue nowadays
proxies surrogates social connection. online texting people lot,
can feel connected. Like plane's take off everyone's texting
whether not fear flying not. like, "Okay, see you. Love
you. Hate you." Whatever trying communicate people. plane
lands, every phone's out, "See you. Love you. Hate you." hope fewer hate yous.
everyone kind need stay connected one another. Humans
incredibly social creatures. Now, way look whole business social
connection, not just kind wishy-washy new agey perspective. want
point sometimes say wishy-washy new agey. nothing that.
just, goal always put scientific data neurochemistry things
wishy-washy new agey stuff, also can arm
arguments members family life maybe
aren't tuned typical language around practices like, "Oh, connection
really key. get oxytocin."

01:08:20 Oxytocin Myth

Actually, know connection individuals rarely causes release
oxytocin? Oxytocin released particular circumstances like post-orgasm, baby
mother milk let down. associated kind really intense kinds pair bonding
things mother child. Also father child, especially mother child,
relationship lactation system. Couples post-sex. kinds things
reflect deep kind layers biology. oxytocin not just released
walk pat dog head see somebody give hug and,
"Hi, great see you," fist bump. not situation oxytocin. way think
social connection can mitigate long-term effects stress
really systems neuromodulation

01:09:15 Serotonin: Satiety, Safety

like serotonin, blocking certain things really bad us feel
socially isolated. Things like Taqi Kynan. So, let explain are. Serotonin


again, neuromodulator. Neuromodulators little bit like playlists brain.

01:19:15 Adrenal Burnout Myth… Need Know Anyway

point can become problematic. Now, note adrenal burnout.
actually no thing adrenal burnout normal conditions. adrenals

adrenal burnout origins work Nobel Prize winner, Hans Selye, actually
discovered called general adaptation syndrome. discovered lot

many may feel exhausted chronic stress, isn't really physiological
exhaustion happens. eventually got picked ran general

something, however, called adrenal insufficiency syndrome, real
physiological problem people impaired adrenals can't

brain tends go direction interpreting situation bad one. So,
discussion around emotions far nuanced elaborate this,
one way think relationship emotions whether not internal state

again, whether not activated calm not good bad, depends
situation. Certainly, want fall asleep, activated isn't good.
work do, activated great. So, hope today able
take slightly different view thing call stress. Not just see evil,
see powerful useful certain contexts. Great us certain contexts

parents are, neurons control stuff, face, eyes, et
cetera, working together. get stressed, hard us
speak tend jitter kinds things. Just like neurons cause
stress center spinal cord working together get body activated.
Okay, lot science today. now got physiological sigh tool. know
exhale-emphasized breathing will slow heart inhale-emphasized
breathing will speed heart up. So, think something now.

00:40:39 3 Types Stress: Short, Medium Long-Term

think stress not whether not acute chronic, whether not
good us bad us, three different timescales. can arrive
relates emotions. trust me, everything
emotions whether not functioning well emotionally not
functioning well emotionally, whether not coping not coping. So,
typically psychological terms psychological discussions. entering
portal physiology. stuff medical textbooks. will arrive
psychology soon, really want understand difference three
kinds stress three different timescales, short-term, medium-term, long-term,
good bad for. think heard stress bad
us. seen pictures intended frighten us. indeed frightening.
see nice really plump brain left. says healthy control.
see brain says stressed right like withered, see
hippocampus area involved memory smaller. People stressed.
see Alzheimer's brain made worse stress. people
predisposition schizophrenia, get stressed, higher incidence
schizophrenia episodes. hear addicts will relapse stressed.


mean, okay, get it. important, think heard now many
times stress bad.

00:42:10 Positive Effects Short-Term Stress: Immunity Focus

conversation, unfortunately, eclipsed really positive things
stress us short-term. So, stress can short-term, medium-term, long-
term. Long-term stress indeed bad reasons just mentioned many
others. never actually discussed stress terrific for, positive
short-term. think tend overlook important question,
short-term long-term? No one ever bothers tell us chronic,
acute. Right? five minutes? five days? duration final
exams? duration senior thesis college? No one actually draws
boundaries around stuff even general guidelines. so, become bit
mess, frankly, try decipher whole space around stress. So, going try
clean based know scientific data. First
all, acute stress, stress response hits, good immune system.
know might tough pill swallow, absolutely true. fact, stress often
comes form bacterial viral infection. stress response part
organized combat bacterial viral infection. pathways
brain centers activate neurons spinal cord make feel like
want move. neurons brain activate things like spleen,
will deploy killer cells go scavenge incoming bacteria viruses
try eat kill them. So, short-term stress release
adrenaline particular epinephrine, thing, adrenaline epinephrine, good
combating infection. just not discussed enough. So,
discussing here. relates particular tool many ask about,
don't often get opportunity talk appropriate context. not
ever inappropriate talk about, talk now use of,
again, respiration breathing somewhat artificially activate stress response.
will accomplish two things. Okay? return medium long-term stress,
want say short-term stress good dilation pupils, changes
optics eyes, quickening heart rate, sharpening cognition.
fact short-term stress brings certain elements brain online allow


focus. Now, narrows focus. not good seeing so-called big
picture, narrows focus. allows these, call duration path
outcome types analysis. allows evaluate environment, evaluate
need do. primes whole system better cognition. primes immune
system combat infection. makes sense think fact
famine, thirst, bacterial infections, viral infections, invaders, stuff liberates
response body designed get fight back whatever stressor
happens be. Psychological, physical, bacterial, viral. Again, stress response
generic.

00:45:32 Adrenalin (Epinephrine) Deploys Killer Immune Cells

tool takes advantage fact adrenaline released body
adrenals, effect also liberating lot killer cells immune
organs, particular spleen, elsewhere well, interactions
lymphatic system combat infection. way works real world best
captured study can mapped back so-called Wim Hof breathing. Now,
Wim Hof breathing named so-called "Iceman," Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
course, Dutch. He, think self-titled Daredevil. indeed
many, many Guinness Book World Records things like swimming icebergs
going Kilimanjaro shorts crossing desert without water, et cetera.
Things quite dangerous don't know doing. Wim obviously
survived telling survived. two components sort
breathing protocol

00:46:40 Cyclic Deep Breathing Stress: Wim Hof, Tummo & Super-Oxygenation

developed based also called Tummo breathing, T-U-M-M-O.
So, Wim, Tummo breathing. many people call now super
oxygenation breathing. Although breath work aficionados will probably say, well,
not super oxygenation also blowing awful lot carbon dioxide.
talking here, regardless whether not called Wim Hof, Tummo, super
oxygenation, rapid deliberate breathing. So, deliberate hyperventilation.
somebody want this? Well, deliberate hyperventilation done maybe 25 cycles.


inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. Typically, done nose
mouth. Although sometimes just mouth.
15 breaths, 20 breaths, 25 breaths, will feel alert. People anxiety will
feel anxious. might even anxiety attack. However, need ask
kind breathing feels way. pattern breathing, rapid
movements diaphragm will liberate adrenaline adrenals. So,
release adrenaline. mentioned Wim also called "The Iceman." Well,
actually discovered pattern breathing, somewhat. again, maps
back Tummo breathing going cold water. go cold water,
stressor liberate adrenaline response cold water. So, get
ice bath cold shower, will immediately release adrenaline adrenals.
Now, sorts things related psychological control stress
thresholds talk about, really want people understand
adrenaline released body, better position combat infections.
so, whether not breathe quickly cycles 25 breaths regardless
call it, doesn't matter, adrenaline released. take cold shower,
adrenaline released. go ice bath deliberately, even non-
deliberately, adrenaline released. mimicking stress response.
adrenaline serves suppress combat incoming infections. beautifully
shown study published fine journal, "Proceedings
National Academy Sciences US." literally called "Proceedings
National Academy USA" distinguish proceedings national
academies countries. way experiment went people injected
endotoxin cases injected bacterial wall mimics
infection. gives fever. makes feel nauseous. makes feel sick.
not pleasant. Half people particular pattern breathing looked
much like pattern breathing described moment ago 25 deep inhales
exhales followed exhale holding breath. repeating 25 inhales,
exhales holding breath. So, look something like this, listening,
sounds like [inhaling exhaling]. 25, 30 times, start feeling heated up.
start feeling adrenaline response. liberating adrenaline body.
exhale, hold breath 15 seconds repeat. typically,
three four rounds that, inhale deeply hold breath. Now,
want emphasize never ever, ever anywhere near water. People passed


out. So-called shallow water blackout. People died. Don't bathtub. Don't
hot tub. Don't swimming. Please don't anywhere near water.
Please don't all, unless get clearance doctor
pulmonary effects whatnot. breath holds definitely not
done anyone glaucoma pressure concerns eyes. repeated
cycles breathing liberate adrenaline allowed group protocol
essentially experience zero symptoms ejection E. coli,
remarkable. much reduced no symptoms. didn't feel feverish.
didn't feel sick. weren't vomiting, no diarrhea, remarkable, makes total
sense think fact short-term stress response there,
typically called acute stress response,

00:50:58 Inflammation Useful Good, Short Term

designed combat stressors. fact, cut deeply
hike woods, thing happen
rapid inflammation response. always hear inflammation bad. Inflammation
gives us Alzheimer's. Inflammation worst thing. swelling associated,
inflammation associated recruitment things like macrophages microglia
neural tissue. Cells brain body whose job act like little ambulances
rush site clean up. indeed inflammation response looks
horrible, sounds horrible, great thing short-term. want
tissue marked trouble want body brain react it. So,
getting peaks stress time time throughout day throughout week,
better position combat infection. better position heal
wounds, physical wounds. Many great things happen stress response. Now,
course, stress response

00:52:02 Procrastination Self-Manufactured Nootropics

isn't always super intense. Sometimes milder. Sometimes allows us just focus
something deadline. can feel stressful, one
reasons procrastinators there, people always asking can done
procrastination? can done procrastination can understand


happening, self-imposing stress stress acts like drug.
powerful nootropic. get asked nootropics. powerful nootropic
smart drug stress. concern failure. desire well.
impending deadline. the, "Oh gosh, thing now going
fail." best nootropic will ever find. combined good night's
sleep, talk about. spent whole month sleep. So, don't want
backtrack much. Okay. So, short-term stress, great. key able turn
stress response off done, don't want that.

00:53:00 Relaxation Can Causes Illness

fact, just really tamp relationship short-term acute stress
response infection. Many us familiar experience work, work, work,
work, work, taking care loved one, stress, stress, stress, stress, finally
relax. Maybe even go vacation. Like, "Oh, now finally going get break."
get sick. adrenaline response crashed
immune system crashed it. So, please understand this. Now, many might
say, "Well, long? two hours? three hours?" lot really
like specificity, will vary everybody. just kind use rule thumb.
no longer able achieve good sleep, good sleep means you,
please see episodes sleep want tools sleep,

forever, need learn turn off stress response. Physiological sigh one.
going activate stress response intentionally ice baths, cold showers,
cyclic hyperoxygenated breathing, aka Tummo breathing Wim Hof breathing, also
need learn press brake. Okay? So, think stress system.
knows activate itself.

00:54:30 Immune Activation Protocol

Now talking way deliberately activating stress system order


combat infection. time time. might feel tickle throat like
getting kind run down, will kind breathing. do. will take 25 30 breaths.
Exhale, hold breath. 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold breath 15

inhale. hold breath feel impulse breathe. Again, feel safe
me. run doctor, fine. not unless right you.
this. people like ice bath. rarely ice bath. people like
cold showers. like hot showers. So, take hot showers, kind breathing.
Again, less effect

00:55:20 Medium Term Stress: Clear Definition

increasing adrenaline, allows combat infection

Medium-term stress going stress lasts anywhere several days

01:06:30 Tools Dealing Long Term Stress

years end. best tools, best mechanisms know modulate long-
term stress might surprise little bit. First all, going things
don't surprise you, everyone knows getting regular exercise, getting good sleep,
using real-time tools try tamp stress response, et cetera, going
really useful. data really points fact social connection certain


types social connection particular going mitigate reduce long-
term stress. particularly important issue nowadays
proxies surrogates social connection. online texting people lot,
can feel connected. Like plane's take off everyone's texting
whether not fear flying not. like, "Okay, see you. Love
you. Hate you." Whatever trying communicate people. plane
lands, every phone's out, "See you. Love you. Hate you." hope fewer hate yous.
everyone kind need stay connected one another. Humans
incredibly social creatures. Now, way look whole business social
connection, not just kind wishy-washy new agey perspective. want
point sometimes say wishy-washy new agey. nothing that.
just, goal always put scientific data neurochemistry things
wishy-washy new agey stuff, also can arm
arguments members family life maybe
aren't tuned typical language around practices like, "Oh, connection
really key. get oxytocin."

01:08:20 Oxytocin Myth

Actually, know connection individuals rarely causes release
oxytocin? Oxytocin released particular circumstances like post-orgasm, baby
mother milk let down. associated kind really intense kinds pair bonding
things mother child. Also father child, especially mother child,
relationship lactation system. Couples post-sex. kinds things
reflect deep kind layers biology. oxytocin not just released

"Hi, great see you," fist bump. not situation oxytocin. way think
social connection can mitigate long-term effects stress
really systems neuromodulation

many may feel exhausted chronic stress, isn't really physiological
exhaustion happens. eventually got picked ran general
public. talk adrenal burnout. much coffee, adrenal burnout. hear
stuff. no thing adrenal burnout. adrenals don't burn out.
something, however, called adrenal insufficiency syndrome, real
physiological problem people impaired adrenals can't

agree everything neuroscience emotions, subscribed
everything heard Lisa say. particular, fact emotions context-
dependent. cultural dependence, et cetera. look things mainly
lens physiology neuroscience kind low-level circuitry. one way think
emotions think consistent think Lisa generally approve, can't
speak her, hope generally approve description,


internal state stress calm matches demands us mismatched
demands us, tend interpret good bad. Let give
example. feeling anxious, stressed inside, lot do,
doesn't feel good, really no different tired lot
mismatch. not right internal state, internal state
incorrect rather, meet demands placed upon me. So, cases,
whether tired stressed need do, valence, meaning
value assigned don't feel good. not good situation don't
feel good. Now, might call stressed, might call anxious, might call worried,
might call number things, not good. However, tired want
fall asleep, well feel good demand is. need go sleep
tired. wide awake need fall asleep, not good.
brain tends go direction interpreting situation bad one. So,
discussion around emotions far nuanced elaborate this,
one way think relationship emotions whether not internal state
matching demands upon you. So, way, don't really place
much value whether not feeling alert sleepy. place value
whether not alertness whether not full-blown stress not sleepiness,
whether not falling asleep just little bit drowsy, whether not matches
conditions face. useful framework have. reason
part spent last hour half talking stress control
stress. One reason think valuable opportunity learn
tools understand stress really learn take control stress,
think benefit regardless age. reason
start understand kind see-saw system body,
autonomic nervous system takes alert calm stressed full-blown
panic, capacity, sleepy drowsy passing tired God forbid,
hope never, coma, right? basically see-saw time.
see-saw alertness calmness positions
better reaction demands face. Whether not thing face
need fall asleep listen quietly not react. now know, instance,
job take feedback, maybe going job evaluation
relationship call discussion somebody needs talk
something need talk something, going like,


"Goodness, going rough." Learning reduce stress response little bit
position hear information better, remember,
previous episode, close eyes, able actually focus
information better. permission not look someone directly eye
talk really want hear say. will able
modulate stress response

01:32:00 Modulating Reactivity, Mindfulness, & Functionality Objective Tools

lean life better. will able react things effective way
not reactive. really one important things anyway,
much language around psychology, think wonderful field, pop
psychology particular responsive, not reactive. Well, great.
one that? Well, one modulating short-term stress response real
time. Not saying, "Hold on, need meditate. Hold on, need massage
can conversation." modulating reactivity real time. one,
instance, mindful? beautiful concept, mindful? Well,
don't know, moving day, lot times just trying get things
done. soon start monitoring seeing kind third-
personing doing, actually takes effectiveness experience
doing. me, sometimes mindfulness, observer, call it,
something doesn't help me. actually hinders me. important
able work focus able disengage. able non-sleep

01:34:00 Next Steps

controlling internal landscape. So, think set stage
headed next, talk things normally think
think emotions, like happiness, like awe, like joy. will get
that. rests firmly foundation thing call
autonomic nervous system. stress modulation. calming modulation system.
again, whether not activated calm not good bad, depends
situation. Certainly, want fall asleep, activated isn't good.
work do, activated great. So, hope today able
take slightly different view thing call stress. Not just see evil,
see powerful useful certain contexts. Great us certain contexts
problematic contexts. well think various tools
presented can allow adjust modulate internal levels alertness
calmness can lean effectively life, includes sleep social
connection work do. course, acknowledges events
world beyond control. control react them.
Something commonly said wellness self-help psychology world,
often aren't many concrete tools can really look trust

00:39:45 Breathing Speaking Clearly

speak clearly, control muscles face jaw. Maybe means not
saying certain things stressed, just generally relax. so, brings
us back neuroscience parasympathetic nervous system. calming
system genetically encoded us have, regardless
parents are, neurons control stuff, face, eyes, et
cetera, working together. get stressed, hard us
speak tend jitter kinds things. Just like neurons cause
stress center spinal cord working together get body activated.
Okay, lot science today. now got physiological sigh tool. know
exhale-emphasized breathing will slow heart inhale-emphasized
breathing will speed heart up. So, think something now.

00:40:39 3 Types Stress: Short, Medium Long-Term

think stress not whether not acute chronic, whether not
good us bad us, three different timescales. can arrive
relates emotions. trust me, everything
emotions whether not functioning well emotionally not
functioning well emotionally, whether not coping not coping. So,
typically psychological terms psychological discussions. entering
portal physiology. stuff medical textbooks. will arrive
psychology soon, really want understand difference three
kinds stress three different timescales, short-term, medium-term, long-term,
good bad for. think heard stress bad
us. seen pictures intended frighten us. indeed frightening.
see nice really plump brain left. says healthy control.
see brain says stressed right like withered, see
hippocampus area involved memory smaller. People stressed.
see Alzheimer's brain made worse stress. people
predisposition schizophrenia, get stressed, higher incidence
schizophrenia episodes. hear addicts will relapse stressed.


mean, okay, get it. important, think heard now many
times stress bad.

00:42:10 Positive Effects Short-Term Stress: Immunity Focus

conversation, unfortunately, eclipsed really positive things
stress us short-term. So, stress can short-term, medium-term, long-
term. Long-term stress indeed bad reasons just mentioned many
others. never actually discussed stress terrific for, positive
short-term. think tend overlook important question,
short-term long-term? No one ever bothers tell us chronic,
acute. Right? five minutes? five days? duration final
exams? duration senior thesis college? No one actually draws
boundaries around stuff even general guidelines. so, become bit
mess, frankly, try decipher whole space around stress. So, going try
clean based know scientific data. First
all, acute stress, stress response hits, good immune system.
know might tough pill swallow, absolutely true. fact, stress often
comes form bacterial viral infection. stress response part
organized combat bacterial viral infection. pathways
brain centers activate neurons spinal cord make feel like
want move. neurons brain activate things like spleen,
will deploy killer cells go scavenge incoming bacteria viruses
try eat kill them. So, short-term stress release
adrenaline particular epinephrine, thing, adrenaline epinephrine, good
combating infection. just not discussed enough. So,
discussing here. relates particular tool many ask about,
don't often get opportunity talk appropriate context. not
ever inappropriate talk about, talk now use of,
again, respiration breathing somewhat artificially activate stress response.
will accomplish two things. Okay? return medium long-term stress,
want say short-term stress good dilation pupils, changes
optics eyes, quickening heart rate, sharpening cognition.
fact short-term stress brings certain elements brain online allow


focus. Now, narrows focus. not good seeing so-called big
picture, narrows focus. allows these, call duration path
outcome types analysis. allows evaluate environment, evaluate
need do. primes whole system better cognition. primes immune
system combat infection. makes sense think fact
famine, thirst, bacterial infections, viral infections, invaders, stuff liberates
response body designed get fight back whatever stressor
happens be. Psychological, physical, bacterial, viral. Again, stress response
generic.

00:45:32 Adrenalin (Epinephrine) Deploys Killer Immune Cells

tool takes advantage fact adrenaline released body
adrenals, effect also liberating lot killer cells immune
organs, particular spleen, elsewhere well, interactions
lymphatic system combat infection. way works real world best
captured study can mapped back so-called Wim Hof breathing. Now,
Wim Hof breathing named so-called "Iceman," Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
course, Dutch. He, think self-titled Daredevil. indeed
many, many Guinness Book World Records things like swimming icebergs
going Kilimanjaro shorts crossing desert without water, et cetera.
Things quite dangerous don't know doing. Wim obviously
survived telling survived. two components sort
breathing protocol

00:46:40 Cyclic Deep Breathing Stress: Wim Hof, Tummo & Super-Oxygenation

developed based also called Tummo breathing, T-U-M-M-O.
So, Wim, Tummo breathing. many people call now super
oxygenation breathing. Although breath work aficionados will probably say, well,
not super oxygenation also blowing awful lot carbon dioxide.
talking here, regardless whether not called Wim Hof, Tummo, super
oxygenation, rapid deliberate breathing. So, deliberate hyperventilation.
somebody want this? Well, deliberate hyperventilation done maybe 25 cycles.


inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. Typically, done nose
mouth. Although sometimes just mouth.
15 breaths, 20 breaths, 25 breaths, will feel alert. People anxiety will
feel anxious. might even anxiety attack. However, need ask
kind breathing feels way. pattern breathing, rapid
movements diaphragm will liberate adrenaline adrenals. So,
release adrenaline. mentioned Wim also called "The Iceman." Well,
actually discovered pattern breathing, somewhat. again, maps
back Tummo breathing going cold water. go cold water,
stressor liberate adrenaline response cold water. So, get
ice bath cold shower, will immediately release adrenaline adrenals.
Now, sorts things related psychological control stress
thresholds talk about, really want people understand
adrenaline released body, better position combat infections.
so, whether not breathe quickly cycles 25 breaths regardless
call it, doesn't matter, adrenaline released. take cold shower,
adrenaline released. go ice bath deliberately, even non-
deliberately, adrenaline released. mimicking stress response.
adrenaline serves suppress combat incoming infections. beautifully
shown study published fine journal, "Proceedings
National Academy Sciences US." literally called "Proceedings
National Academy USA" distinguish proceedings national
academies countries. way experiment went people injected
endotoxin cases injected bacterial wall mimics
infection. gives fever. makes feel nauseous. makes feel sick.
not pleasant. Half people particular pattern breathing looked
much like pattern breathing described moment ago 25 deep inhales
exhales followed exhale holding breath. repeating 25 inhales,
exhales holding breath. So, look something like this, listening,
sounds like [inhaling exhaling]. 25, 30 times, start feeling heated up.
start feeling adrenaline response. liberating adrenaline body.
exhale, hold breath 15 seconds repeat. typically,
three four rounds that, inhale deeply hold breath. Now,
want emphasize never ever, ever anywhere near water. People passed


out. So-called shallow water blackout. People died. Don't bathtub. Don't
hot tub. Don't swimming. Please don't anywhere near water.
Please don't all, unless get clearance doctor
pulmonary effects whatnot. breath holds definitely not
done anyone glaucoma pressure concerns eyes. repeated
cycles breathing liberate adrenaline allowed group protocol
essentially experience zero symptoms ejection E. coli,
remarkable. much reduced no symptoms. didn't feel feverish.
didn't feel sick. weren't vomiting, no diarrhea, remarkable, makes total
sense think fact short-term stress response there,
typically called acute stress response,

00:50:58 Inflammation Useful Good, Short Term

designed combat stressors. fact, cut deeply
hike woods, thing happen
rapid inflammation response. always hear inflammation bad. Inflammation
gives us Alzheimer's. Inflammation worst thing. swelling associated,
inflammation associated recruitment things like macrophages microglia
neural tissue. Cells brain body whose job act like little ambulances
rush site clean up. indeed inflammation response looks
horrible, sounds horrible, great thing short-term. want
tissue marked trouble want body brain react it. So,
getting peaks stress time time throughout day throughout week,
better position combat infection. better position heal
wounds, physical wounds. Many great things happen stress response. Now,
course, stress response

00:52:02 Procrastination Self-Manufactured Nootropics

isn't always super intense. Sometimes milder. Sometimes allows us just focus
something deadline. can feel stressful, one
reasons procrastinators there, people always asking can done
procrastination? can done procrastination can understand


happening, self-imposing stress stress acts like drug.
powerful nootropic. get asked nootropics. powerful nootropic
smart drug stress. concern failure. desire well.
impending deadline. the, "Oh gosh, thing now going
fail." best nootropic will ever find. combined good night's
sleep, talk about. spent whole month sleep. So, don't want
backtrack much. Okay. So, short-term stress, great. key able turn
stress response off done, don't want that.

00:53:00 Relaxation Can Causes Illness

fact, just really tamp relationship short-term acute stress
response infection. Many us familiar experience work, work, work,
work, work, taking care loved one, stress, stress, stress, stress, finally
relax. Maybe even go vacation. Like, "Oh, now finally going get break."
get sick. adrenaline response crashed
immune system crashed it. So, please understand this. Now, many might
say, "Well, long? two hours? three hours?" lot really
like specificity, will vary everybody. just kind use rule thumb.
no longer able achieve good sleep, good sleep means you,
please see episodes sleep want tools sleep,
no longer able achieve good sleep, now moving acute stress chronic
stress. need able turn stress response off. one wish, well,
many wishes lifetime, one wish today hope will permeate
spread there, idea need young age, even adults
forever, need learn turn off stress response. Physiological sigh one.
going activate stress response intentionally ice baths, cold showers,
cyclic hyperoxygenated breathing, aka Tummo breathing Wim Hof breathing, also
need learn press brake. Okay? So, think stress system.
knows activate itself.

00:54:30 Immune Activation Protocol

Now talking way deliberately activating stress system order


combat infection. time time. might feel tickle throat like
getting kind run down, will kind breathing. do. will take 25 30 breaths.
Exhale, hold breath. 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold breath 15
seconds. 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold breath 25 30 seconds. big
inhale. hold breath feel impulse breathe. Again, feel safe
me. run doctor, fine. not unless right you.
this. people like ice bath. rarely ice bath. people like
cold showers. like hot showers. So, take hot showers, kind breathing.
Again, less effect

00:55:20 Medium Term Stress: Clear Definition

increasing adrenaline, allows combat infection
activating immune response. Okay. So, now talk medium-term stress.
Medium-term stress going stress lasts anywhere several days
several weeks. Okay. might think long-term stress. times life

00:56:07 Stress Threshold

medium-term stress? stress threshold? Well, stress threshold

01:04:36 Long Term Stress: Definition, Measurement, Cardiovascular Risks

Zero-cost tools. Okay, talk long-term stress. Earlier, talked
breathing can modulate heart rate loop includes brain
parasympathetic nervous system. don't think mentioned this, want make sure
mentioned breathing controlling heart rate sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system basis called HRV, heart rate variability.
know heart rate variability good. don't want heart rate
chronically elevated chronically low. lot people think, "Oh, want really nice low
heart rate." indeed, shape, stroke volume heart will greater
can nice slow heart rate. Years ago running regularly, think
heart rate like 50 60 something like that. great. But,
now higher running little bit less. everyone needs
determine right them. don't really want heart rate
chronically low chronically high. bad. know chronic stress, elevated
stress especially so-called type personalities creates heart disease,
leading killer most, every country, particular US. way
adrenaline impacts blood vessels constricting dilating others,
just kind hypertension, chronic hypertension just bad. so, chronic stress
truly bad. want really make clear emphasized lot
positive effects stress. want able tamp stress real
time. also want able modulate stress emotional relationship
stress body medium-term, no means want stressed
time, chronically months months months

01:06:30 Tools Dealing Long Term Stress

years end. best tools, best mechanisms know modulate long-
term stress might surprise little bit. First all, going things
don't surprise you, everyone knows getting regular exercise, getting good sleep,
using real-time tools try tamp stress response, et cetera, going
really useful. data really points fact social connection certain


types social connection particular going mitigate reduce long-
term stress. particularly important issue nowadays
proxies surrogates social connection. online texting people lot,
can feel connected. Like plane's take off everyone's texting
whether not fear flying not. like, "Okay, see you. Love
you. Hate you." Whatever trying communicate people. plane
lands, every phone's out, "See you. Love you. Hate you." hope fewer hate yous.
everyone kind need stay connected one another. Humans
incredibly social creatures. Now, way look whole business social
connection, not just kind wishy-washy new agey perspective. want
point sometimes say wishy-washy new agey. nothing that.
just, goal always put scientific data neurochemistry things
wishy-washy new agey stuff, also can arm
arguments members family life maybe
aren't tuned typical language around practices like, "Oh, connection
really key. get oxytocin."

01:08:20 Oxytocin Myth

Actually, know connection individuals rarely causes release
oxytocin? Oxytocin released particular circumstances like post-orgasm, baby
mother milk let down. associated kind really intense kinds pair bonding
things mother child. Also father child, especially mother child,
relationship lactation system. Couples post-sex. kinds things
reflect deep kind layers biology. oxytocin not just released
walk pat dog head see somebody give hug and,
"Hi, great see you," fist bump. not situation oxytocin. way think
social connection can mitigate long-term effects stress
really systems neuromodulation

01:09:15 Serotonin: Satiety, Safety

like serotonin, blocking certain things really bad us feel
socially isolated. Things like Taqi Kynan. So, let explain are. Serotonin


again, neuromodulator. Neuromodulators little bit like playlists brain.
tend amplify bias likelihood certain brain circuits body circuits
going activated others will not. Serotonin generally, realize
speaking generally here, generally gives us feelings wellbeing. high

human-human attachment. attachments humans well.
can attachments people. can romantic attachments.
familial attachments non-romantic, friendship, pets, even

or, "Nobody wants engage socially anymore." first admit, social

whether tired stressed need do, valence, meaning

tired. wide awake need fall asleep, not good.
brain tends go direction interpreting situation bad one. So,
discussion around emotions far nuanced elaborate this,
one way think relationship emotions whether not internal state

00:42:10 Positive Effects Short-Term Stress: Immunity Focus

conversation, unfortunately, eclipsed really positive things
stress us short-term. So, stress can short-term, medium-term, long-
term. Long-term stress indeed bad reasons just mentioned many
others. never actually discussed stress terrific for, positive
short-term. think tend overlook important question,
short-term long-term? No one ever bothers tell us chronic,
acute. Right? five minutes? five days? duration final
exams? duration senior thesis college? No one actually draws
boundaries around stuff even general guidelines. so, become bit
mess, frankly, try decipher whole space around stress. So, going try
clean based know scientific data. First
all, acute stress, stress response hits, good immune system.
know might tough pill swallow, absolutely true. fact, stress often
comes form bacterial viral infection. stress response part
organized combat bacterial viral infection. pathways
brain centers activate neurons spinal cord make feel like
want move. neurons brain activate things like spleen,
will deploy killer cells go scavenge incoming bacteria viruses
try eat kill them. So, short-term stress release
adrenaline particular epinephrine, thing, adrenaline epinephrine, good
combating infection. just not discussed enough. So,
discussing here. relates particular tool many ask about,
don't often get opportunity talk appropriate context. not
ever inappropriate talk about, talk now use of,
again, respiration breathing somewhat artificially activate stress response.
will accomplish two things. Okay? return medium long-term stress,
want say short-term stress good dilation pupils, changes
optics eyes, quickening heart rate, sharpening cognition.
fact short-term stress brings certain elements brain online allow


focus. Now, narrows focus. not good seeing so-called big
picture, narrows focus. allows these, call duration path
outcome types analysis. allows evaluate environment, evaluate
need do. primes whole system better cognition. primes immune
system combat infection. makes sense think fact
famine, thirst, bacterial infections, viral infections, invaders, stuff liberates
response body designed get fight back whatever stressor
happens be. Psychological, physical, bacterial, viral. Again, stress response
generic.

adrenals, effect also liberating lot killer cells immune
organs, particular spleen, elsewhere well, interactions
lymphatic system combat infection. way works real world best
captured study can mapped back so-called Wim Hof breathing. Now,
Wim Hof breathing named so-called "Iceman," Wim Hof. Wim Hof,
course, Dutch. He, think self-titled Daredevil. indeed
many, many Guinness Book World Records things like swimming icebergs
going Kilimanjaro shorts crossing desert without water, et cetera.
Things quite dangerous don't know doing. Wim obviously
survived telling survived. two components sort
breathing protocol

00:46:40 Cyclic Deep Breathing Stress: Wim Hof, Tummo & Super-Oxygenation

developed based also called Tummo breathing, T-U-M-M-O.
So, Wim, Tummo breathing. many people call now super
oxygenation breathing. Although breath work aficionados will probably say, well,
not super oxygenation also blowing awful lot carbon dioxide.
talking here, regardless whether not called Wim Hof, Tummo, super
oxygenation, rapid deliberate breathing. So, deliberate hyperventilation.
somebody want this? Well, deliberate hyperventilation done maybe 25 cycles.


inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. Typically, done nose
mouth. Although sometimes just mouth.
15 breaths, 20 breaths, 25 breaths, will feel alert. People anxiety will
feel anxious. might even anxiety attack. However, need ask
kind breathing feels way. pattern breathing, rapid
movements diaphragm will liberate adrenaline adrenals. So,
release adrenaline. mentioned Wim also called "The Iceman." Well,
actually discovered pattern breathing, somewhat. again, maps
back Tummo breathing going cold water. go cold water,
stressor liberate adrenaline response cold water. So, get
ice bath cold shower, will immediately release adrenaline adrenals.
Now, sorts things related psychological control stress
thresholds talk about, really want people understand
adrenaline released body, better position combat infections.
so, whether not breathe quickly cycles 25 breaths regardless
call it, doesn't matter, adrenaline released. take cold shower,
adrenaline released. go ice bath deliberately, even non-
deliberately, adrenaline released. mimicking stress response.
adrenaline serves suppress combat incoming infections. beautifully
shown study published fine journal, "Proceedings
National Academy Sciences US." literally called "Proceedings
National Academy USA" distinguish proceedings national
academies countries. way experiment went people injected
endotoxin cases injected bacterial wall mimics
infection. gives fever. makes feel nauseous. makes feel sick.
not pleasant. Half people particular pattern breathing looked
much like pattern breathing described moment ago 25 deep inhales
exhales followed exhale holding breath. repeating 25 inhales,
exhales holding breath. So, look something like this, listening,
sounds like [inhaling exhaling]. 25, 30 times, start feeling heated up.
start feeling adrenaline response. liberating adrenaline body.
exhale, hold breath 15 seconds repeat. typically,
three four rounds that, inhale deeply hold breath. Now,
want emphasize never ever, ever anywhere near water. People passed


out. So-called shallow water blackout. People died. Don't bathtub. Don't
hot tub. Don't swimming. Please don't anywhere near water.
Please don't all, unless get clearance doctor
pulmonary effects whatnot. breath holds definitely not
done anyone glaucoma pressure concerns eyes. repeated
cycles breathing liberate adrenaline allowed group protocol
essentially experience zero symptoms ejection E. coli,
remarkable. much reduced no symptoms. didn't feel feverish.
didn't feel sick. weren't vomiting, no diarrhea, remarkable, makes total
sense think fact short-term stress response there,
typically called acute stress response,

00:50:58 Inflammation Useful Good, Short Term

designed combat stressors. fact, cut deeply
hike woods, thing happen
rapid inflammation response. always hear inflammation bad. Inflammation
gives us Alzheimer's. Inflammation worst thing. swelling associated,
inflammation associated recruitment things like macrophages microglia
neural tissue. Cells brain body whose job act like little ambulances
rush site clean up. indeed inflammation response looks
horrible, sounds horrible, great thing short-term. want
tissue marked trouble want body brain react it. So,
getting peaks stress time time throughout day throughout week,
better position combat infection. better position heal
wounds, physical wounds. Many great things happen stress response. Now,
course, stress response

00:52:02 Procrastination Self-Manufactured Nootropics

isn't always super intense. Sometimes milder. Sometimes allows us just focus
something deadline. can feel stressful, one
reasons procrastinators there, people always asking can done
procrastination? can done procrastination can understand


happening, self-imposing stress stress acts like drug.
powerful nootropic. get asked nootropics. powerful nootropic
smart drug stress. concern failure. desire well.
impending deadline. the, "Oh gosh, thing now going
fail." best nootropic will ever find. combined good night's
sleep, talk about. spent whole month sleep. So, don't want
backtrack much. Okay. So, short-term stress, great. key able turn
stress response off done, don't want that.

00:53:00 Relaxation Can Causes Illness

fact, just really tamp relationship short-term acute stress
response infection. Many us familiar experience work, work, work,
work, work, taking care loved one, stress, stress, stress, stress, finally
relax. Maybe even go vacation. Like, "Oh, now finally going get break."
get sick. adrenaline response crashed
immune system crashed it. So, please understand this. Now, many might
say, "Well, long? two hours? three hours?" lot really
like specificity, will vary everybody. just kind use rule thumb.
no longer able achieve good sleep, good sleep means you,
please see episodes sleep want tools sleep,
no longer able achieve good sleep, now moving acute stress chronic
stress. need able turn stress response off. one wish, well,
many wishes lifetime, one wish today hope will permeate
spread there, idea need young age, even adults
forever, need learn turn off stress response. Physiological sigh one.
going activate stress response intentionally ice baths, cold showers,
cyclic hyperoxygenated breathing, aka Tummo breathing Wim Hof breathing, also
need learn press brake. Okay? So, think stress system.
knows activate itself.

00:54:30 Immune Activation Protocol

Now talking way deliberately activating stress system order


combat infection. time time. might feel tickle throat like
getting kind run down, will kind breathing. do. will take 25 30 breaths.
Exhale, hold breath. 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold breath 15
seconds. 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold breath 25 30 seconds. big
inhale. hold breath feel impulse breathe. Again, feel safe
me. run doctor, fine. not unless right you.
this. people like ice bath. rarely ice bath. people like
cold showers. like hot showers. So, take hot showers, kind breathing.
Again, less effect

00:55:20 Medium Term Stress: Clear Definition

increasing adrenaline, allows combat infection
activating immune response. Okay. So, now talk medium-term stress.
Medium-term stress going stress lasts anywhere several days

01:06:30 Tools Dealing Long Term Stress

years end. best tools, best mechanisms know modulate long-
term stress might surprise little bit. First all, going things
don't surprise you, everyone knows getting regular exercise, getting good sleep,
using real-time tools try tamp stress response, et cetera, going
really useful. data really points fact social connection certain


types social connection particular going mitigate reduce long-
term stress. particularly important issue nowadays
proxies surrogates social connection. online texting people lot,
can feel connected. Like plane's take off everyone's texting
whether not fear flying not. like, "Okay, see you. Love
you. Hate you." Whatever trying communicate people. plane
lands, every phone's out, "See you. Love you. Hate you." hope fewer hate yous.
everyone kind need stay connected one another. Humans
incredibly social creatures. Now, way look whole business social
connection, not just kind wishy-washy new agey perspective. want
point sometimes say wishy-washy new agey. nothing that.
just, goal always put scientific data neurochemistry things
wishy-washy new agey stuff, also can arm
arguments members family life maybe
aren't tuned typical language around practices like, "Oh, connection
really key. get oxytocin."

01:08:20 Oxytocin Myth

Actually, know connection individuals rarely causes release
oxytocin? Oxytocin released particular circumstances like post-orgasm, baby
mother milk let down. associated kind really intense kinds pair bonding
things mother child. Also father child, especially mother child,
relationship lactation system. Couples post-sex. kinds things

mismatch. not right internal state, internal state
incorrect rather, meet demands placed upon me. So, cases,
whether tired stressed need do, valence, meaning

tired. wide awake need fall asleep, not good.
brain tends go direction interpreting situation bad one. So,
discussion around emotions far nuanced elaborate this,
one way think relationship emotions whether not internal state

Wim Hof breathing named so-called "Iceman," Wim Hof. Wim Hof,

Things quite dangerous don't know doing. Wim obviously

breathing protocol

00:46:40 Cyclic Deep Breathing Stress: Wim Hof, Tummo & Super-Oxygenation

developed based also called Tummo breathing, T-U-M-M-O.
So, Wim, Tummo breathing. many people call now super
oxygenation breathing. Although breath work aficionados will probably say, well,
not super oxygenation also blowing awful lot carbon dioxide.
talking here, regardless whether not called Wim Hof, Tummo, super
oxygenation, rapid deliberate breathing. So, deliberate hyperventilation.
somebody want this? Well, deliberate hyperventilation done maybe 25 cycles.


inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. Typically, done nose
mouth. Although sometimes just mouth.
15 breaths, 20 breaths, 25 breaths, will feel alert. People anxiety will
feel anxious. might even anxiety attack. However, need ask
kind breathing feels way. pattern breathing, rapid
movements diaphragm will liberate adrenaline adrenals. So,
release adrenaline. mentioned Wim also called "The Iceman." Well,
actually discovered pattern breathing, somewhat. again, maps
back Tummo breathing going cold water. go cold water,
stressor liberate adrenaline response cold water. So, get
ice bath cold shower, will immediately release adrenaline adrenals.
Now, sorts things related psychological control stress
thresholds talk about, really want people understand
adrenaline released body, better position combat infections.
so, whether not breathe quickly cycles 25 breaths regardless
call it, doesn't matter, adrenaline released. take cold shower,
adrenaline released. go ice bath deliberately, even non-
deliberately, adrenaline released. mimicking stress response.
adrenaline serves suppress combat incoming infections. beautifully
shown study published fine journal, "Proceedings
National Academy Sciences US." literally called "Proceedings

endotoxin cases injected bacterial wall mimics
infection. gives fever. makes feel nauseous. makes feel sick.
not pleasant. Half people particular pattern breathing looked
much like pattern breathing described moment ago 25 deep inhales
exhales followed exhale holding breath. repeating 25 inhales,
exhales holding breath. So, look something like this, listening,
sounds like [inhaling exhaling]. 25, 30 times, start feeling heated up.
start feeling adrenaline response. liberating adrenaline body.
exhale, hold breath 15 seconds repeat. typically,
three four rounds that, inhale deeply hold breath. Now,
want emphasize never ever, ever anywhere near water. People passed

hot tub. Don't swimming. Please don't anywhere near water.
Please don't all, unless get clearance doctor

essentially experience zero symptoms ejection E. coli,

typically called acute stress response,

00:50:58 Inflammation Useful Good, Short Term

designed combat stressors. fact, cut deeply
hike woods, thing happen
rapid inflammation response. always hear inflammation bad. Inflammation
gives us Alzheimer's. Inflammation worst thing. swelling associated,
inflammation associated recruitment things like macrophages microglia
neural tissue. Cells brain body whose job act like little ambulances

horrible, sounds horrible, great thing short-term. want

getting peaks stress time time throughout day throughout week,
better position combat infection. better position heal

course, stress response

00:52:02 Procrastination Self-Manufactured Nootropics

isn't always super intense. Sometimes milder. Sometimes allows us just focus
something deadline. can feel stressful, one
reasons procrastinators there, people always asking can done
procrastination? can done procrastination can understand


happening, self-imposing stress stress acts like drug.
powerful nootropic. get asked nootropics. powerful nootropic
smart drug stress. concern failure. desire well.
impending deadline. the, "Oh gosh, thing now going
fail." best nootropic will ever find. combined good night's

backtrack much. Okay. So, short-term stress, great. key able turn
stress response off done, don't want that.

00:53:00 Relaxation Can Causes Illness

fact, just really tamp relationship short-term acute stress
response infection. Many us familiar experience work, work, work,
work, work, taking care loved one, stress, stress, stress, stress, finally
relax. Maybe even go vacation. Like, "Oh, now finally going get break."
get sick. adrenaline response crashed
immune system crashed it. So, please understand this. Now, many might
say, "Well, long? two hours? three hours?" lot really
like specificity, will vary everybody. just kind use rule thumb.
no longer able achieve good sleep, good sleep means you,
please see episodes sleep want tools sleep,
no longer able achieve good sleep, now moving acute stress chronic
stress. need able turn stress response off. one wish, well,
many wishes lifetime, one wish today hope will permeate
spread there, idea need young age, even adults
forever, need learn turn off stress response. Physiological sigh one.
going activate stress response intentionally ice baths, cold showers,
cyclic hyperoxygenated breathing, aka Tummo breathing Wim Hof breathing, also
need learn press brake. Okay? So, think stress system.
knows activate itself.

00:54:30 Immune Activation Protocol

Now talking way deliberately activating stress system order


combat infection. time time. might feel tickle throat like
getting kind run down, will kind breathing. do. will take 25 30 breaths.
Exhale, hold breath. 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold breath 15
seconds. 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold breath 25 30 seconds. big
inhale. hold breath feel impulse breathe. Again, feel safe
me. run doctor, fine. not unless right you.
this. people like ice bath. rarely ice bath. people like
cold showers. like hot showers. So, take hot showers, kind breathing.
Again, less effect

00:55:20 Medium Term Stress: Clear Definition

activating immune response. Okay. So, now talk medium-term stress.
Medium-term stress going stress lasts anywhere several days

01:06:30 Tools Dealing Long Term Stress

years end. best tools, best mechanisms know modulate long-
term stress might surprise little bit. First all, going things
don't surprise you, everyone knows getting regular exercise, getting good sleep,
using real-time tools try tamp stress response, et cetera, going
really useful. data really points fact social connection certain


types social connection particular going mitigate reduce long-
term stress. particularly important issue nowadays
proxies surrogates social connection. online texting people lot,
can feel connected. Like plane's take off everyone's texting
whether not fear flying not. like, "Okay, see you. Love
you. Hate you." Whatever trying communicate people. plane
lands, every phone's out, "See you. Love you. Hate you." hope fewer hate yous.
everyone kind need stay connected one another. Humans
incredibly social creatures. Now, way look whole business social
connection, not just kind wishy-washy new agey perspective. want
point sometimes say wishy-washy new agey. nothing that.
just, goal always put scientific data neurochemistry things
wishy-washy new agey stuff, also can arm
arguments members family life maybe
aren't tuned typical language around practices like, "Oh, connection
really key. get oxytocin."

01:08:20 Oxytocin Myth

Actually, know connection individuals rarely causes release
oxytocin? Oxytocin released particular circumstances like post-orgasm, baby
mother milk let down. associated kind really intense kinds pair bonding
things mother child. Also father child, especially mother child,
relationship lactation system. Couples post-sex. kinds things
reflect deep kind layers biology. oxytocin not just released
walk pat dog head see somebody give hug and,
"Hi, great see you," fist bump. not situation oxytocin. way think
social connection can mitigate long-term effects stress
really systems neuromodulation

01:09:15 Serotonin: Satiety, Safety

like serotonin, blocking certain things really bad us feel
socially isolated. Things like Taqi Kynan. So, let explain are. Serotonin


again, neuromodulator. Neuromodulators little bit like playlists brain.
tend amplify bias likelihood certain brain circuits body circuits
going activated others will not. Serotonin generally, realize
speaking generally here, generally gives us feelings wellbeing. high
levels, makes us feel blissed tends make us feel like enough

elevate serotonin, actually can help lot people depressive symptoms.
side effects associated drugs increase serotonin tend reduced affect.
tend kind blunt affect make people feel like libido lower. Desire goes

certain positive effects immune system systems
neural repair synopsis things really reinforce connections brain
prevent long-term withering connections. So, serotonin tied social
connection. Now, social connection can take many forms. many know,

seems less attached well. no scientific evidence
human-human attachment. attachments humans well.
can attachments people. can romantic attachments.
familial attachments non-romantic, friendship, pets, even
attachments things just delight us. One things really can mitigate
long-term negative effects chronic long-term stress isn't just fun.
hear stuff, "You need play fun." can little bit tough
concept, especially hard driving people people stressed,
sense delight, sense really enjoying something see engage in,
witness, participate in, associated serotonin system. certainly,
play one things. Social connection various forms. things
invest in. people might say, "Well, nobody wants friend,"

01:12:00 Delight Flexibility



or, "Nobody wants engage socially anymore." first admit, social
connection friendship relationships kinds animals humans
inanimate objects takes work. takes investment. takes time not needing everything
exactly way want be. friend struggles
oftentimes conversations just circle back fact want social

actually no thing adrenal burnout normal conditions. adrenals

something, however, called adrenal insufficiency syndrome, real
physiological problem people impaired adrenals can't

Zero-cost tools. Okay, talk long-term stress. Earlier, talked
breathing can modulate heart rate loop includes brain
parasympathetic nervous system. don't think mentioned this, want make sure
mentioned breathing controlling heart rate sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system basis called HRV, heart rate variability.
know heart rate variability good. don't want heart rate
chronically elevated chronically low. lot people think, "Oh, want really nice low
heart rate." indeed, shape, stroke volume heart will greater
can nice slow heart rate. Years ago running regularly, think
heart rate like 50 60 something like that. great. But,
now higher running little bit less. everyone needs

stress especially so-called type personalities creates heart disease,
leading killer most, every country, particular US. way
adrenaline impacts blood vessels constricting dilating others,

01:06:30 Tools Dealing Long Term Stress

years end. best tools, best mechanisms know modulate long-
term stress might surprise little bit. First all, going things
don't surprise you, everyone knows getting regular exercise, getting good sleep,
using real-time tools try tamp stress response, et cetera, going
really useful. data really points fact social connection certain


types social connection particular going mitigate reduce long-
term stress. particularly important issue nowadays
proxies surrogates social connection. online texting people lot,
can feel connected. Like plane's take off everyone's texting
whether not fear flying not. like, "Okay, see you. Love
you. Hate you." Whatever trying communicate people. plane
lands, every phone's out, "See you. Love you. Hate you." hope fewer hate yous.
everyone kind need stay connected one another. Humans
incredibly social creatures. Now, way look whole business social
connection, not just kind wishy-washy new agey perspective. want
point sometimes say wishy-washy new agey. nothing that.
just, goal always put scientific data neurochemistry things
wishy-washy new agey stuff, also can arm
arguments members family life maybe
aren't tuned typical language around practices like, "Oh, connection
really key. get oxytocin."

01:08:20 Oxytocin Myth

Actually, know connection individuals rarely causes release
oxytocin? Oxytocin released particular circumstances like post-orgasm, baby
mother milk let down. associated kind really intense kinds pair bonding
things mother child. Also father child, especially mother child,
relationship lactation system. Couples post-sex. kinds things
reflect deep kind layers biology. oxytocin not just released
walk pat dog head see somebody give hug and,
"Hi, great see you," fist bump. not situation oxytocin. way think
social connection can mitigate long-term effects stress
really systems neuromodulation

01:09:15 Serotonin: Satiety, Safety

like serotonin, blocking certain things really bad us feel
socially isolated. Things like Taqi Kynan. So, let explain are. Serotonin


again, neuromodulator. Neuromodulators little bit like playlists brain.
tend amplify bias likelihood certain brain circuits body circuits
going activated others will not. Serotonin generally, realize
speaking generally here, generally gives us feelings wellbeing. high
levels, makes us feel blissed tends make us feel like enough

elevate serotonin, actually can help lot people depressive symptoms.
side effects associated drugs increase serotonin tend reduced affect.
tend kind blunt affect make people feel like libido lower. Desire goes
body much serotonin brain much serotonin,
one feels like enough. serotonin, pharmacology aside taking
antidepressants aside topic another time, serotonin tends make us feel good.
see somebody recognize trust, serotonin released brain.
certain positive effects immune system systems
neural repair synopsis things really reinforce connections brain
prevent long-term withering connections. So, serotonin tied social
connection. Now, social connection can take many forms. many know,
attached dog. hope attached me. asleep time. So,
don't know. even awake, don't really know ask him.
seems less attached well. no scientific evidence
human-human attachment. attachments humans well.
can attachments people. can romantic attachments.
familial attachments non-romantic, friendship, pets, even
attachments things just delight us. One things really can mitigate
long-term negative effects chronic long-term stress isn't just fun.
hear stuff, "You need play fun." can little bit tough
concept, especially hard driving people people stressed,
sense delight, sense really enjoying something see engage in,
witness, participate in, associated serotonin system. certainly,
play one things. Social connection various forms. things
invest in. people might say, "Well, nobody wants friend,"

01:12:00 Delight Flexibility



or, "Nobody wants engage socially anymore." first admit, social
connection friendship relationships kinds animals humans
inanimate objects takes work. takes investment. takes time not needing everything
exactly way want be. friend struggles
oftentimes conversations just circle back fact want social
connection, often flexible. eat people's

called, L-theanine theanine often called, melatonin.
talk melatonin first. Melatonin talked month sleep. Melatonin
hormone secreted pineal direct relationship much darkness

asleep. doesn't help stay asleep. personally not recommend supplementing
melatonin supplemented typically high levels. One three
milligrams even outrageously high dose. super, super physiological

kids, melatonin suppresses puberty response number species.
Enough negative things melatonin except people take much
melatonin chronically, oftentimes taking sleep whatever reason,
yes, can reduce anxiety stress, also can reduce output adrenals



01:19:15 Adrenal Burnout Myth… Need Know Anyway

point can become problematic. Now, note adrenal burnout.
actually no thing adrenal burnout normal conditions. adrenals
enough adrenaline support 200 years stress better, worse. concept
adrenal burnout origins work Nobel Prize winner, Hans Selye, actually
discovered called general adaptation syndrome. discovered lot
things stress. phenomenal work turned true.
stressors. something called distress. talked eustress,
positive stress. Eustress never really caught kind general
discussion. theory stress went long enough,
eventually reach phase called exhaustion. turned wrong. Although
many may feel exhausted chronic stress, isn't really physiological
exhaustion happens. eventually got picked ran general
public. talk adrenal burnout. much coffee, adrenal burnout. hear
stuff. no thing adrenal burnout. adrenals don't burn out.
something, however, called adrenal insufficiency syndrome, real
physiological problem people impaired adrenals can't
produce adrenaline. melatonin taken high levels periods time
long can cause suppression cortisol epinephrine released
adrenals can create kind pseudo adrenal insufficiency syndrome. So, aware
melatonin reason. Please, trying, alone can't get rid phrase adrenal
burnout. not trying give hard time anyone feels burnt exhausted,
reasons. not adrenals burnt out. Unless
happen adrenal insufficiency syndrome. So, not fan melatonin lot
reasons. Now mentioned several.

01:21:10 L-Theanine Stress Reduction Task Completion Anxiety

L-theanine. talked L-theanine, provided safe you,
can taken 100 milligrams 200 milligrams 30 minutes 60 minutes

know want those, go examine.com, put theanine. linked, instance,
known significantly increase relaxation. four studies listed
PubMed links. known minor effect anxiety, eight studies

one reason supplement theanine sleep. feeling like
lot stress not managing stress well short-term

great. mean, opportunity anyway, able take something
can help reduce cortisol don't get long-term effects
stress. not going take ashwagandha year round.
feeling like wasn't managing short medium-term stress well. So, don't take
regular basis. take times things particularly
stressful. five studies show reduced stress. So, not cortisol
measurements, things like fatigue, cognitive impairment, et cetera. lower total

internal state stress calm matches demands us mismatched
demands us, tend interpret good bad. Let give
example. feeling anxious, stressed inside, lot do,
doesn't feel good, really no different tired lot
mismatch. not right internal state, internal state
incorrect rather, meet demands placed upon me. So, cases,
whether tired stressed need do, valence, meaning
value assigned don't feel good. not good situation don't
feel good. Now, might call stressed, might call anxious, might call worried,
might call number things, not good. However, tired want
fall asleep, well feel good demand is. need go sleep
tired. wide awake need fall asleep, not good.
brain tends go direction interpreting situation bad one. So,
discussion around emotions far nuanced elaborate this,
one way think relationship emotions whether not internal state
matching demands upon you. So, way, don't really place
much value whether not feeling alert sleepy. place value
whether not alertness whether not full-blown stress not sleepiness,
whether not falling asleep just little bit drowsy, whether not matches

headed next, talk things normally think
think emotions, like happiness, like awe, like joy. will get
that. rests firmly foundation thing call
autonomic nervous system. stress modulation. calming modulation system.
again, whether not activated calm not good bad, depends
situation. Certainly, want fall asleep, activated isn't good.
work do, activated great. So, hope today able
take slightly different view thing call stress. Not just see evil,
see powerful useful certain contexts. Great us certain contexts
problematic contexts. well think various tools
presented can allow adjust modulate internal levels alertness
calmness can lean effectively life, includes sleep social
connection work do. course, acknowledges events
world beyond control. control react them.
Something commonly said wellness self-help psychology world,
often aren't many concrete tools can really look trust

designed combat stressors. fact, cut deeply

course, stress response

00:52:02 Procrastination Self-Manufactured Nootropics

00:53:00 Relaxation Can Causes Illness

fact, just really tamp relationship short-term acute stress

work, work, taking care loved one, stress, stress, stress, stress, finally
relax. Maybe even go vacation. Like, "Oh, now finally going get break."

Zero-cost tools. Okay, talk long-term stress. Earlier, talked
breathing can modulate heart rate loop includes brain
parasympathetic nervous system. don't think mentioned this, want make sure
mentioned breathing controlling heart rate sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system basis called HRV, heart rate variability.
know heart rate variability good. don't want heart rate
chronically elevated chronically low. lot people think, "Oh, want really nice low
heart rate." indeed, shape, stroke volume heart will greater
can nice slow heart rate. Years ago running regularly, think
heart rate like 50 60 something like that. great. But,
now higher running little bit less. everyone needs
determine right them. don't really want heart rate
chronically low chronically high. bad. know chronic stress, elevated
stress especially so-called type personalities creates heart disease,
leading killer most, every country, particular US. way
adrenaline impacts blood vessels constricting dilating others,
just kind hypertension, chronic hypertension just bad. so, chronic stress
truly bad. want really make clear emphasized lot
positive effects stress. want able tamp stress real
time. also want able modulate stress emotional relationship
stress body medium-term, no means want stressed

01:06:30 Tools Dealing Long Term Stress

years end. best tools, best mechanisms know modulate long-
term stress might surprise little bit. First all, going things
don't surprise you, everyone knows getting regular exercise, getting good sleep,
using real-time tools try tamp stress response, et cetera, going
really useful. data really points fact social connection certain


types social connection particular going mitigate reduce long-
term stress. particularly important issue nowadays
proxies surrogates social connection. online texting people lot,
can feel connected. Like plane's take off everyone's texting
whether not fear flying not. like, "Okay, see you. Love
you. Hate you." Whatever trying communicate people. plane
lands, every phone's out, "See you. Love you. Hate you." hope fewer hate yous.
everyone kind need stay connected one another. Humans
incredibly social creatures. Now, way look whole business social
connection, not just kind wishy-washy new agey perspective. want
point sometimes say wishy-washy new agey. nothing that.
just, goal always put scientific data neurochemistry things
wishy-washy new agey stuff, also can arm
arguments members family life maybe
aren't tuned typical language around practices like, "Oh, connection
really key. get oxytocin."

01:08:20 Oxytocin Myth

Actually, know connection individuals rarely causes release
oxytocin? Oxytocin released particular circumstances like post-orgasm, baby
mother milk let down. associated kind really intense kinds pair bonding
things mother child. Also father child, especially mother child,
relationship lactation system. Couples post-sex. kinds things
reflect deep kind layers biology. oxytocin not just released
walk pat dog head see somebody give hug and,
"Hi, great see you," fist bump. not situation oxytocin. way think
social connection can mitigate long-term effects stress
really systems neuromodulation

01:09:15 Serotonin: Satiety, Safety

like serotonin, blocking certain things really bad us feel
socially isolated. Things like Taqi Kynan. So, let explain are. Serotonin


again, neuromodulator. Neuromodulators little bit like playlists brain.
tend amplify bias likelihood certain brain circuits body circuits
going activated others will not. Serotonin generally, realize
speaking generally here, generally gives us feelings wellbeing. high
levels, makes us feel blissed tends make us feel like enough
immediate environment. side effects antidepressants
elevate serotonin, actually can help lot people depressive symptoms.
side effects associated drugs increase serotonin tend reduced affect.
tend kind blunt affect make people feel like libido lower. Desire goes
body much serotonin brain much serotonin,
one feels like enough. serotonin, pharmacology aside taking
antidepressants aside topic another time, serotonin tends make us feel good.
see somebody recognize trust, serotonin released brain.
certain positive effects immune system systems
neural repair synopsis things really reinforce connections brain
prevent long-term withering connections. So, serotonin tied social
connection. Now, social connection can take many forms. many know,
attached dog. hope attached me. asleep time. So,
don't know. even awake, don't really know ask him.
seems less attached well. no scientific evidence
human-human attachment. attachments humans well.
can attachments people. can romantic attachments.
familial attachments non-romantic, friendship, pets, even
attachments things just delight us. One things really can mitigate
long-term negative effects chronic long-term stress isn't just fun.
hear stuff, "You need play fun." can little bit tough
concept, especially hard driving people people stressed,
sense delight, sense really enjoying something see engage in,
witness, participate in, associated serotonin system. certainly,
play one things. Social connection various forms. things
invest in. people might say, "Well, nobody wants friend,"

01:12:00 Delight Flexibility



or, "Nobody wants engage socially anymore." first admit, social
connection friendship relationships kinds animals humans
inanimate objects takes work. takes investment. takes time not needing everything
exactly way want be. friend struggles
oftentimes conversations just circle back fact want social
connection, often flexible. eat people's

talk melatonin first. Melatonin talked month sleep. Melatonin
hormone secreted pineal direct relationship much darkness

melatonin chronically, oftentimes taking sleep whatever reason,
yes, can reduce anxiety stress, also can reduce output adrenals



01:19:15 Adrenal Burnout Myth… Need Know Anyway

point can become problematic. Now, note adrenal burnout.
actually no thing adrenal burnout normal conditions. adrenals
enough adrenaline support 200 years stress better, worse. concept
adrenal burnout origins work Nobel Prize winner, Hans Selye, actually
discovered called general adaptation syndrome. discovered lot
things stress. phenomenal work turned true.
stressors. something called distress. talked eustress,
positive stress. Eustress never really caught kind general
discussion. theory stress went long enough,
eventually reach phase called exhaustion. turned wrong. Although
many may feel exhausted chronic stress, isn't really physiological
exhaustion happens. eventually got picked ran general
public. talk adrenal burnout. much coffee, adrenal burnout. hear
stuff. no thing adrenal burnout. adrenals don't burn out.
something, however, called adrenal insufficiency syndrome, real
physiological problem people impaired adrenals can't
produce adrenaline. melatonin taken high levels periods time
long can cause suppression cortisol epinephrine released
adrenals can create kind pseudo adrenal insufficiency syndrome. So, aware
melatonin reason. Please, trying, alone can't get rid phrase adrenal

reasons. Now mentioned several.

01:21:10 L-Theanine Stress Reduction Task Completion Anxiety

know heart rate variability good. don't want heart rate
chronically elevated chronically low. lot people think, "Oh, want really nice low
heart rate." indeed, shape, stroke volume heart will greater
can nice slow heart rate. Years ago running regularly, think
heart rate like 50 60 something like that. great. But,
now higher running little bit less. everyone needs
determine right them. don't really want heart rate
chronically low chronically high. bad. know chronic stress, elevated
stress especially so-called type personalities creates heart disease,
leading killer most, every country, particular US. way
adrenaline impacts blood vessels constricting dilating others,
just kind hypertension, chronic hypertension just bad. so, chronic stress
truly bad. want really make clear emphasized lot
positive effects stress. want able tamp stress real
time. also want able modulate stress emotional relationship
stress body medium-term, no means want stressed
time, chronically months months months

01:06:30 Tools Dealing Long Term Stress

years end. best tools, best mechanisms know modulate long-
term stress might surprise little bit. First all, going things
don't surprise you, everyone knows getting regular exercise, getting good sleep,
using real-time tools try tamp stress response, et cetera, going
really useful. data really points fact social connection certain


types social connection particular going mitigate reduce long-
term stress. particularly important issue nowadays
proxies surrogates social connection. online texting people lot,
can feel connected. Like plane's take off everyone's texting
whether not fear flying not. like, "Okay, see you. Love
you. Hate you." Whatever trying communicate people. plane
lands, every phone's out, "See you. Love you. Hate you." hope fewer hate yous.
everyone kind need stay connected one another. Humans
incredibly social creatures. Now, way look whole business social
connection, not just kind wishy-washy new agey perspective. want
point sometimes say wishy-washy new agey. nothing that.
just, goal always put scientific data neurochemistry things
wishy-washy new agey stuff, also can arm
arguments members family life maybe
aren't tuned typical language around practices like, "Oh, connection
really key. get oxytocin."

01:08:20 Oxytocin Myth

Actually, know connection individuals rarely causes release
oxytocin? Oxytocin released particular circumstances like post-orgasm, baby
mother milk let down. associated kind really intense kinds pair bonding
things mother child. Also father child, especially mother child,
relationship lactation system. Couples post-sex. kinds things
reflect deep kind layers biology. oxytocin not just released
walk pat dog head see somebody give hug and,
"Hi, great see you," fist bump. not situation oxytocin. way think
social connection can mitigate long-term effects stress
really systems neuromodulation

01:09:15 Serotonin: Satiety, Safety

like serotonin, blocking certain things really bad us feel
socially isolated. Things like Taqi Kynan. So, let explain are. Serotonin


again, neuromodulator. Neuromodulators little bit like playlists brain.
tend amplify bias likelihood certain brain circuits body circuits
going activated others will not. Serotonin generally, realize
speaking generally here, generally gives us feelings wellbeing. high
levels, makes us feel blissed tends make us feel like enough
immediate environment. side effects antidepressants
elevate serotonin, actually can help lot people depressive symptoms.
side effects associated drugs increase serotonin tend reduced affect.
tend kind blunt affect make people feel like libido lower. Desire goes
body much serotonin brain much serotonin,
one feels like enough. serotonin, pharmacology aside taking
antidepressants aside topic another time, serotonin tends make us feel good.
see somebody recognize trust, serotonin released brain.
certain positive effects immune system systems
neural repair synopsis things really reinforce connections brain
prevent long-term withering connections. So, serotonin tied social
connection. Now, social connection can take many forms. many know,
attached dog. hope attached me. asleep time. So,
don't know. even awake, don't really know ask him.
seems less attached well. no scientific evidence
human-human attachment. attachments humans well.
can attachments people. can romantic attachments.
familial attachments non-romantic, friendship, pets, even
attachments things just delight us. One things really can mitigate
long-term negative effects chronic long-term stress isn't just fun.
hear stuff, "You need play fun." can little bit tough
concept, especially hard driving people people stressed,
sense delight, sense really enjoying something see engage in,
witness, participate in, associated serotonin system. certainly,
play one things. Social connection various forms. things
invest in. people might say, "Well, nobody wants friend,"

01:12:00 Delight Flexibility



or, "Nobody wants engage socially anymore." first admit, social
connection friendship relationships kinds animals humans
inanimate objects takes work. takes investment. takes time not needing everything
exactly way want be. friend struggles
oftentimes conversations just circle back fact want social
connection, often flexible. eat people's
schedules. Sometimes eat things don't necessarily want eat
moment stay little later wake little earlier. Social connection
something work for, incredibly powerful. want to, course, tip heart
to, appropriate call great Robert Sapolsky, colleague

want acknowledge Robert's incredible work discussions around this. can look

01:13:30 Chemical Irritants Make Can Control: Tackykinin

relates stress emotionality. So, social connection part.
thing social isolation goes long associated everything flies,
believe not, mice humans molecule Taqi Kynan. Taqi Kynan
molecule makes us fearful, paranoid, impairs immune system. so,
Taqi Kynan like internal punishment signal. like body brain telling
us, "You're not spending enough time people really trust. not
spending time things really enjoy." often think Taqi Kynan
pretty hard driving. lot pursuits. also lot
wonderful people incredibly wonderful bulldog life, times

01:18:04 Melatonin: Cautionary Note Adrenal Suppression

called, L-theanine theanine often called, melatonin.
talk melatonin first. Melatonin talked month sleep. Melatonin
hormone secreted pineal direct relationship much darkness

asleep. doesn't help stay asleep. personally not recommend supplementing
melatonin supplemented typically high levels. One three
milligrams even outrageously high dose. super, super physiological

Enough negative things melatonin except people take much
melatonin chronically, oftentimes taking sleep whatever reason,
yes, can reduce anxiety stress, also can reduce output adrenals



01:19:15 Adrenal Burnout Myth… Need Know Anyway

point can become problematic. Now, note adrenal burnout.
actually no thing adrenal burnout normal conditions. adrenals
enough adrenaline support 200 years stress better, worse. concept
adrenal burnout origins work Nobel Prize winner, Hans Selye, actually
discovered called general adaptation syndrome. discovered lot
things stress. phenomenal work turned true.
stressors. something called distress. talked eustress,
positive stress. Eustress never really caught kind general
discussion. theory stress went long enough,
eventually reach phase called exhaustion. turned wrong. Although
many may feel exhausted chronic stress, isn't really physiological
exhaustion happens. eventually got picked ran general
public. talk adrenal burnout. much coffee, adrenal burnout. hear
stuff. no thing adrenal burnout. adrenals don't burn out.
something, however, called adrenal insufficiency syndrome, real
physiological problem people impaired adrenals can't
produce adrenaline. melatonin taken high levels periods time
long can cause suppression cortisol epinephrine released
adrenals can create kind pseudo adrenal insufficiency syndrome. So, aware
melatonin reason. Please, trying, alone can't get rid phrase adrenal
burnout. not trying give hard time anyone feels burnt exhausted,
reasons. not adrenals burnt out. Unless
happen adrenal insufficiency syndrome. So, not fan melatonin lot
reasons. Now mentioned several.

01:21:10 L-Theanine Stress Reduction Task Completion Anxiety

L-theanine. talked L-theanine, provided safe you,
can taken 100 milligrams 200 milligrams 30 minutes 60 minutes

feeling like wasn't managing short medium-term stress well. So, don't take

01:06:30 Tools Dealing Long Term Stress

years end. best tools, best mechanisms know modulate long-
term stress might surprise little bit. First all, going things
don't surprise you, everyone knows getting regular exercise, getting good sleep,
using real-time tools try tamp stress response, et cetera, going
really useful. data really points fact social connection certain


types social connection particular going mitigate reduce long-
term stress. particularly important issue nowadays
proxies surrogates social connection. online texting people lot,
can feel connected. Like plane's take off everyone's texting
whether not fear flying not. like, "Okay, see you. Love
you. Hate you." Whatever trying communicate people. plane
lands, every phone's out, "See you. Love you. Hate you." hope fewer hate yous.
everyone kind need stay connected one another. Humans
incredibly social creatures. Now, way look whole business social
connection, not just kind wishy-washy new agey perspective. want
point sometimes say wishy-washy new agey. nothing that.
just, goal always put scientific data neurochemistry things
wishy-washy new agey stuff, also can arm
arguments members family life maybe
aren't tuned typical language around practices like, "Oh, connection
really key. get oxytocin."

01:08:20 Oxytocin Myth

Actually, know connection individuals rarely causes release
oxytocin? Oxytocin released particular circumstances like post-orgasm, baby
mother milk let down. associated kind really intense kinds pair bonding
things mother child. Also father child, especially mother child,
relationship lactation system. Couples post-sex. kinds things

really useful. data really points fact social connection certain


types social connection particular going mitigate reduce long-

proxies surrogates social connection. online texting people lot,

01:04:36 Long Term Stress: Definition, Measurement, Cardiovascular Risks

Zero-cost tools. Okay, talk long-term stress. Earlier, talked
breathing can modulate heart rate loop includes brain
parasympathetic nervous system. don't think mentioned this, want make sure
mentioned breathing controlling heart rate sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system basis called HRV, heart rate variability.
know heart rate variability good. don't want heart rate
chronically elevated chronically low. lot people think, "Oh, want really nice low
heart rate." indeed, shape, stroke volume heart will greater
can nice slow heart rate. Years ago running regularly, think
heart rate like 50 60 something like that. great. But,
now higher running little bit less. everyone needs
determine right them. don't really want heart rate
chronically low chronically high. bad. know chronic stress, elevated
stress especially so-called type personalities creates heart disease,
leading killer most, every country, particular US. way
adrenaline impacts blood vessels constricting dilating others,
just kind hypertension, chronic hypertension just bad. so, chronic stress
truly bad. want really make clear emphasized lot
positive effects stress. want able tamp stress real
time. also want able modulate stress emotional relationship
stress body medium-term, no means want stressed
time, chronically months months months

01:06:30 Tools Dealing Long Term Stress

years end. best tools, best mechanisms know modulate long-
term stress might surprise little bit. First all, going things
don't surprise you, everyone knows getting regular exercise, getting good sleep,
using real-time tools try tamp stress response, et cetera, going
really useful. data really points fact social connection certain


types social connection particular going mitigate reduce long-
term stress. particularly important issue nowadays
proxies surrogates social connection. online texting people lot,
can feel connected. Like plane's take off everyone's texting
whether not fear flying not. like, "Okay, see you. Love
you. Hate you." Whatever trying communicate people. plane
lands, every phone's out, "See you. Love you. Hate you." hope fewer hate yous.
everyone kind need stay connected one another. Humans
incredibly social creatures. Now, way look whole business social
connection, not just kind wishy-washy new agey perspective. want
point sometimes say wishy-washy new agey. nothing that.
just, goal always put scientific data neurochemistry things
wishy-washy new agey stuff, also can arm
arguments members family life maybe
aren't tuned typical language around practices like, "Oh, connection
really key. get oxytocin."

01:08:20 Oxytocin Myth

Actually, know connection individuals rarely causes release
oxytocin? Oxytocin released particular circumstances like post-orgasm, baby
mother milk let down. associated kind really intense kinds pair bonding
things mother child. Also father child, especially mother child,
relationship lactation system. Couples post-sex. kinds things
reflect deep kind layers biology. oxytocin not just released
walk pat dog head see somebody give hug and,
"Hi, great see you," fist bump. not situation oxytocin. way think
social connection can mitigate long-term effects stress
really systems neuromodulation

01:09:15 Serotonin: Satiety, Safety

like serotonin, blocking certain things really bad us feel
socially isolated. Things like Taqi Kynan. So, let explain are. Serotonin


again, neuromodulator. Neuromodulators little bit like playlists brain.
tend amplify bias likelihood certain brain circuits body circuits
going activated others will not. Serotonin generally, realize
speaking generally here, generally gives us feelings wellbeing. high
levels, makes us feel blissed tends make us feel like enough
immediate environment. side effects antidepressants
elevate serotonin, actually can help lot people depressive symptoms.
side effects associated drugs increase serotonin tend reduced affect.
tend kind blunt affect make people feel like libido lower. Desire goes
body much serotonin brain much serotonin,
one feels like enough. serotonin, pharmacology aside taking
antidepressants aside topic another time, serotonin tends make us feel good.
see somebody recognize trust, serotonin released brain.
certain positive effects immune system systems
neural repair synopsis things really reinforce connections brain
prevent long-term withering connections. So, serotonin tied social
connection. Now, social connection can take many forms. many know,
attached dog. hope attached me. asleep time. So,
don't know. even awake, don't really know ask him.
seems less attached well. no scientific evidence
human-human attachment. attachments humans well.
can attachments people. can romantic attachments.
familial attachments non-romantic, friendship, pets, even
attachments things just delight us. One things really can mitigate
long-term negative effects chronic long-term stress isn't just fun.
hear stuff, "You need play fun." can little bit tough
concept, especially hard driving people people stressed,
sense delight, sense really enjoying something see engage in,
witness, participate in, associated serotonin system. certainly,
play one things. Social connection various forms. things
invest in. people might say, "Well, nobody wants friend,"

01:12:00 Delight Flexibility



or, "Nobody wants engage socially anymore." first admit, social
connection friendship relationships kinds animals humans
inanimate objects takes work. takes investment. takes time not needing everything
exactly way want be. friend struggles
oftentimes conversations just circle back fact want social
connection, often flexible. eat people's
schedules. Sometimes eat things don't necessarily want eat
moment stay little later wake little earlier. Social connection
something work for, incredibly powerful. want to, course, tip heart
to, appropriate call great Robert Sapolsky, colleague
unfortunate know Stanford. course, talked quite lot. So,
want acknowledge Robert's incredible work discussions around this. can look
materials online wonderful books. primates, primates,
social species. Robert said many times before, never
primate history, particular human history interacted many
strangers distance not really connected them. So, finding just
people, even one animal something delight in, believe not,
positive effects mitigating long-term stress improving various aspects
life

01:13:30 Chemical Irritants Make Can Control: Tackykinin

relates stress emotionality. So, social connection part.
thing social isolation goes long associated everything flies,
believe not, mice humans molecule Taqi Kynan. Taqi Kynan
molecule makes us fearful, paranoid, impairs immune system. so,
Taqi Kynan like internal punishment signal. like body brain telling
us, "You're not spending enough time people really trust. not
spending time things really enjoy." often think Taqi Kynan
pretty hard driving. lot pursuits. also lot
wonderful people incredibly wonderful bulldog life, times

Taqi Kynan sinister molecule starts secreted not

something really want avoid chronic isolation, chronically high Taqi
Kynan associated long-term stress really depletes many good functions
brain body promote many bad ones including irritability, paranoia, fear, et

01:16:25 Non-Prescription Chemical Compounds Additional Anti-Stress Support

well, compounds not antidepressants. Although need
antidepressants, clinician prescribes you. Please follow advice
right you. compounds not prescription compounds
can modulate stress system. sometimes way life is,


just don't opportunity control life control response stress.
least myself, can talk experience, found useful times
chronic stress start modulating neurochemistry related stress

cautious mentioned before, include ashwagandha, funny name,

01:18:04 Melatonin: Cautionary Note Adrenal Suppression

called, L-theanine theanine often called, melatonin.
talk melatonin first. Melatonin talked month sleep. Melatonin
hormone secreted pineal direct relationship much darkness
in. Not emotional darkness. light suppresses melatonin. Melatonin helps fall
asleep. doesn't help stay asleep. personally not recommend supplementing
melatonin supplemented typically high levels. One three
milligrams even outrageously high dose. super, super physiological
compared normally make. also number potentially negative
effects reproductive access hormones there. people can take without
problems. like thing, fine. just want cue fact
can issues. check examine.com. Talk doctor, especially
kids, melatonin suppresses puberty response number species.
Enough negative things melatonin except people take much
melatonin chronically, oftentimes taking sleep whatever reason,
yes, can reduce anxiety stress, also can reduce output adrenals



01:19:15 Adrenal Burnout Myth… Need Know Anyway

point can become problematic. Now, note adrenal burnout.
actually no thing adrenal burnout normal conditions. adrenals
enough adrenaline support 200 years stress better, worse. concept
adrenal burnout origins work Nobel Prize winner, Hans Selye, actually
discovered called general adaptation syndrome. discovered lot
things stress. phenomenal work turned true.
stressors. something called distress. talked eustress,
positive stress. Eustress never really caught kind general
discussion. theory stress went long enough,
eventually reach phase called exhaustion. turned wrong. Although
many may feel exhausted chronic stress, isn't really physiological
exhaustion happens. eventually got picked ran general
public. talk adrenal burnout. much coffee, adrenal burnout. hear
stuff. no thing adrenal burnout. adrenals don't burn out.
something, however, called adrenal insufficiency syndrome, real
physiological problem people impaired adrenals can't
produce adrenaline. melatonin taken high levels periods time
long can cause suppression cortisol epinephrine released
adrenals can create kind pseudo adrenal insufficiency syndrome. So, aware
melatonin reason. Please, trying, alone can't get rid phrase adrenal
burnout. not trying give hard time anyone feels burnt exhausted,
reasons. not adrenals burnt out. Unless
happen adrenal insufficiency syndrome. So, not fan melatonin lot
reasons. Now mentioned several.

01:21:10 L-Theanine Stress Reduction Task Completion Anxiety

L-theanine. talked L-theanine, provided safe you,
can taken 100 milligrams 200 milligrams 30 minutes 60 minutes
sleep. can enhance transition sleep depth sleep many people.
increases GABA, inhibitory neurotransmitter brain. tends turn off


forebrain little bit reduce activity kind thinking systems ruminating
systems help people fall asleep. sleep. theanine also shown
people chronically anxious chronically stressed to, look studies,
large collection studies front right now, want see links,
know want those, go examine.com, put theanine. linked, instance,
known significantly increase relaxation. four studies listed
PubMed links. known minor effect anxiety, eight studies
shown that. think fairly large set studies. great journals.
also can reduce task completion anxiety. So, anxiety related task completion. Not
good procrastinators perhaps, chronically stressed.
can increase attention little bit, can reduce blood pressure little bit, improve sleep
quality, et cetera. definitely notable effect stress, two studies particular,
can notably reduce effects stress. So, lot there. also effects
insomnia, blood lipid profiles. so, go examine.com check out.
one reason supplement theanine sleep. feeling like
lot stress not managing stress well short-term
medium-term tools talked earlier, might start taking little bit theanine
especially late afternoon, tend start feel like haven't gotten
enough done day kind carrying on. so, can blunt response
stress little bit,

01:23:00 Beware Taurine Energy Drinks Taurine

lot companies now putting theanine energy drinks. not

effects microvasculature least me, not good. cause bursting
microvasculature sclera, eyes, not fan energy drink
taurine taurine generally. just me. decide you.
sure comment section, there'll couple taurinesters will say,
"But love taurine." Great.

01:23:30 Ashwagandha: Can Powerfully Lower Anxiety Cortisol



Keep taurine companies business. not me. like people know
may may not them. supplement can useful
ashwagandha. Ashwagandha known lower anxiety cortisol. six,
are, excuse me, six studies collectively show reductions cortisol, cortisol
typically associated waking morning, good. healthy,
brief cortisol bump goes away provided getting light right time
days correct times day, like morning evening. don't want cortisol
chronically elevated. associated bad stuff stress.
strong effect ashwagandha. can find dosages examine.com. report
across six studies, 14.5 27.9 reduction cortisol otherwise healthy, stressed
individuals. Now, don't know kids. look says various
supplements. things done adults. So, please check carefully.
great. mean, opportunity anyway, able take something
can help reduce cortisol don't get long-term effects
stress. not going take ashwagandha year round.
feeling like wasn't managing short medium-term stress well. So, don't take
regular basis. take times things particularly
stressful. five studies show reduced stress. So, not cortisol
measurements, things like fatigue, cognitive impairment, et cetera. lower total
cholesterol, may may not good bad 10%. So, people
don't want cholesterol lowered. people might. Cholesterol, talk
month hormones, cholesterol molecule testosterone
estrogen cortisol matter synthesized. So, don't want get
cholesterol low, sorts negative effects, don't want
high either. Mild effects good clinical studies reducing depression, probably
associated effects stress things well. So, ashwagandha
something use time time. kind interesting. L-theanine, rarely will use
daytime, except conditions

01:06:30 Tools Dealing Long Term Stress

years end. best tools, best mechanisms know modulate long-
term stress might surprise little bit. First all, going things
don't surprise you, everyone knows getting regular exercise, getting good sleep,
using real-time tools try tamp stress response, et cetera, going
really useful. data really points fact social connection certain


types social connection particular going mitigate reduce long-
term stress. particularly important issue nowadays
proxies surrogates social connection. online texting people lot,
can feel connected. Like plane's take off everyone's texting
whether not fear flying not. like, "Okay, see you. Love
you. Hate you." Whatever trying communicate people. plane
lands, every phone's out, "See you. Love you. Hate you." hope fewer hate yous.
everyone kind need stay connected one another. Humans
incredibly social creatures. Now, way look whole business social
connection, not just kind wishy-washy new agey perspective. want
point sometimes say wishy-washy new agey. nothing that.
just, goal always put scientific data neurochemistry things
wishy-washy new agey stuff, also can arm
arguments members family life maybe
aren't tuned typical language around practices like, "Oh, connection
really key. get oxytocin."

01:08:20 Oxytocin Myth

Actually, know connection individuals rarely causes release
oxytocin? Oxytocin released particular circumstances like post-orgasm, baby
mother milk let down. associated kind really intense kinds pair bonding
things mother child. Also father child, especially mother child,
relationship lactation system. Couples post-sex. kinds things
reflect deep kind layers biology. oxytocin not just released
walk pat dog head see somebody give hug and,
"Hi, great see you," fist bump. not situation oxytocin. way think
social connection can mitigate long-term effects stress
really systems neuromodulation

01:09:15 Serotonin: Satiety, Safety

like serotonin, blocking certain things really bad us feel
socially isolated. Things like Taqi Kynan. So, let explain are. Serotonin


again, neuromodulator. Neuromodulators little bit like playlists brain.
tend amplify bias likelihood certain brain circuits body circuits
going activated others will not. Serotonin generally, realize
speaking generally here, generally gives us feelings wellbeing. high

seems less attached well. no scientific evidence
human-human attachment. attachments humans well.
can attachments people. can romantic attachments.
familial attachments non-romantic, friendship, pets, even
attachments things just delight us. One things really can mitigate
long-term negative effects chronic long-term stress isn't just fun.
hear stuff, "You need play fun." can little bit tough
concept, especially hard driving people people stressed,
sense delight, sense really enjoying something see engage in,
witness, participate in, associated serotonin system. certainly,
play one things. Social connection various forms. things

many may feel exhausted chronic stress, isn't really physiological
exhaustion happens. eventually got picked ran general
public. talk adrenal burnout. much coffee, adrenal burnout. hear

something, however, called adrenal insufficiency syndrome, real
physiological problem people impaired adrenals can't

adrenals can create kind pseudo adrenal insufficiency syndrome. So, aware
melatonin reason. Please, trying, alone can't get rid phrase adrenal

discussion around emotions far nuanced elaborate this,

internal state stress calm matches demands us mismatched
demands us, tend interpret good bad. Let give
example. feeling anxious, stressed inside, lot do,
doesn't feel good, really no different tired lot
mismatch. not right internal state, internal state
incorrect rather, meet demands placed upon me. So, cases,
whether tired stressed need do, valence, meaning

might call number things, not good. However, tired want
fall asleep, well feel good demand is. need go sleep
tired. wide awake need fall asleep, not good.
brain tends go direction interpreting situation bad one. So,
discussion around emotions far nuanced elaborate this,
one way think relationship emotions whether not internal state

much value whether not feeling alert sleepy. place value
whether not alertness whether not full-blown stress not sleepiness,
whether not falling asleep just little bit drowsy, whether not matches

eventually reach phase called exhaustion. turned wrong. Although
many may feel exhausted chronic stress, isn't really physiological
exhaustion happens. eventually got picked ran general
public. talk adrenal burnout. much coffee, adrenal burnout. hear
stuff. no thing adrenal burnout. adrenals don't burn out.
something, however, called adrenal insufficiency syndrome, real
physiological problem people impaired adrenals can't
produce adrenaline. melatonin taken high levels periods time
long can cause suppression cortisol epinephrine released
adrenals can create kind pseudo adrenal insufficiency syndrome. So, aware

eventually reach phase called exhaustion. turned wrong. Although
many may feel exhausted chronic stress, isn't really physiological
exhaustion happens. eventually got picked ran general
public. talk adrenal burnout. much coffee, adrenal burnout. hear
stuff. no thing adrenal burnout. adrenals don't burn out.
something, however, called adrenal insufficiency syndrome, real
physiological problem people impaired adrenals can't

long can cause suppression cortisol epinephrine released
adrenals can create kind pseudo adrenal insufficiency syndrome. So, aware
melatonin reason. Please, trying, alone can't get rid phrase adrenal

whether tired stressed need do, valence, meaning

discussion around emotions far nuanced elaborate this,
one way think relationship emotions whether not internal state

again, whether not activated calm not good bad, depends
