00:07:35 Artificial Intelligence?

claim special offer. now, conversation Dr. Lex Fridman. - meet
again. - meet again. Thanks much sitting me. question
think lot people's minds lot people's minds,
hear terms lot days, think people, including scientists
including don't know really artificial intelligence, different
things like machine learning robotics? So, kind explain
us, artificial intelligence, machine learning? - Well, think
question complicated fascinating question of, intelligence?
So, think artificial intelligence, first, big philosophical thing. Pamela McCormick
said AI ancient wish forge gods, born ancient wish forge
gods. think big philosophical level, longing create
intelligence systems. Perhaps systems powerful us. narrow level,
think also set tools computational mathematical tools automate
different tasks. also attempt understand mind. So, build
systems exhibit intelligent behavior order understand intelligence
selves. things true. course, AI really means
community, set researchers engineers, set tools, set
computational techniques allow solve various problems. long
history approaches problem different perspectives. always
throughout one threads, one communities goes flag machine
learning, emphasizing AI space, task learning. make
machine knows little beginning, follow kind process learns
become better better particular task? effective
recent 15 years set techniques fall flag deep learning
utilize neural networks. networks fascinating things inspired
structure human brain, loosely, a, network little


basic computational units called neurons, artificial neurons. have,
architectures input output. know nothing beginning,
task learning something interesting. something interesting is, usually
involves particular task. lot ways talk break down.
Like one much human supervision required teach thing.
supervised learning broad category, neural network knows nothing
beginning given bunch examples computer vision will
examples cats, dogs, cars, traffic signs, given image
given ground truth image. get large database
image examples know truth, neural network able learn
example, called supervised learning. lot fascinating questions within
that, is, provide truth? given image cat,
provide computer image contains cat? just say entire
image picture cat? commonly done,
bounding box, crude box around cat's face saying, cat?
semantic segmentation? Mind you, 2D image cat. not,
computer knows nothing three-dimensional world, just looking set
pixels. So, semantic segmentation drawing nice, crisp outline around cat
saying, cat. really difficult provide truth. one
fundamental open questions computer vision is, even good representation
truth? Now, another contrasting set ideas attention
overlapping is, well, used called unsupervised learning. commonly now
called self-supervised learning. trying get less less less human
supervision task. self-supervised learning more, successful
domain language model, natural English processing, now
successful computer vision task. idea is, let machine
without ground-truth annotation just look pictures internet, look texts
internet try learn something generalizable ideas
core language core vision. based that, humans best like
call common sense. this, giant base knowledge top
build sophisticated knowledge. kind commonsense
knowledge. idea self-supervised learning build commonsense
knowledge about, fundamental visual ideas make cat dog
kinds things without ever human supervision? dream


the, just let AI system self supervised run around internet awhile,
watch YouTube videos millions millions hours, without supervision
primed ready actually learn examples human able
show up. think children way, human children, parents give one
two examples teach concept. dream self-supervised learning will
machines. watch millions hours YouTube videos,
come human able understand human shows them,
cat. Like, remember this' cat. will understand cat not just thing
pointy ears, cat thing orange, furry, see something
fundamental humans might not actually able introspect understand.
Like, asked you, makes cat versus dog, wouldn't probably not able
answer that, showed you, brought cat dog, able tell
difference. ideas brain uses make difference?
whole dream self-supervised learning, able learn own.
set commonsense knowledge, able tell difference.
like lot incredible uses self-supervised learning, weirdly called self-play
mechanism. mechanism behind reinforcement learning successes
systems won Go, at, AlphaZero won chess. - Oh, see. play games? -
[Lex] play games. - Got it. - idea self-play probably, applies
domains just games. system just plays itself. fascinating
kinds domains, knows nothing beginning. whole idea
creates bunch mutations plays versions itself.
fascinating thing play systems little bit better you,
start get better yourself. Like learning, learning happens. true
martial arts. true lot cases. want interacting systems
just little better you. process interacting systems
just little better you, start following process everybody starts
getting better better better better several orders magnitude
better world champion chess, example. fascinating
like runaway system. One terrifying exciting things David Silver,
creator AlphaGo AlphaZero, one leaders team said, a,
haven't found ceiling AlphaZero. Meaning just arbitrarily keep
improving. Now, realm chess, doesn't matter us. like, just ran
away game chess. Like like just much better humans.


question what, can create realm bigger, deeper
effect human beings societies, can terrifying process. me,
exciting process supervise correctly, inject, called value
alignment, make sure goals AI optimizing aligned human
beings human societies. lot fascinating things talk within
specifics neural networks problems people working on.
say really big, exciting one self-supervised learning. trying get less
less human supervision, less less human supervision neural networks. also
just comment shut up. - No, please keep going. learning. questions,
learning. please keep going. - So, exciting not theory,
always application. One exciting applications artificial intelligence,
specifically neural networks machine learning Tesla Autopilot.
systems working real world. isn't academic exercise.
human lives stake. safety-critical. - automated vehicles.
Autonomous vehicles. - Semi-autonomous. want be. - Okay. - gone
wars topics, - Semi-autonomous vehicles. - Semi-autonomous. So,
even though called FSD, Full Self-Driving, currently not fully autonomous,
meaning human supervision required. So, human tasked overseeing
systems. fact, liability-wise, human always responsible. human factor
psychology question, fascinating. fascinated whole space,
whole 'nother space human robot interaction AI systems humans work
together accomplish tasks. dance one smaller communities,
think will one important open problems solved,
humans robots dance together. me, semi-autonomous driving one
spaces. Elon, example, doesn't see way, sees semi-autonomous
driving stepping stone towards fully autonomous driving. Like, humans robots
can't dance well together. Like, humans humans dance robots robots
dance. Like, need to, engineering problem, need design perfect
robot solves problem. forever, maybe not case driving,
world going full problems always humans robots interact,
think robots will always flawed, just like humans going flawed,
flawed. makes life beautiful, flawed. learning
happens edge capabilities. always figure out, can
flawed robots flawed humans interact together they, like sum bigger


whole, opposed focusing just building perfect robot? - Mm-hmm. -
one exciting applications say artificial intelligence
autonomous driving, semi-autonomous driving. really good example
machine learning systems constantly learning. process
maybe can comment on, the, Andrej Karpathy head autopilot
calls data engine. process applies lot machine learning,
build system pretty good stuff, send real world,
starts stuff runs called edge cases, like failure cases,
screws up. kids. have- - adults. -
adults. Exactly. learn really quickly. whole point,
fascinating thing driving, realize millions edge cases. just
like weird situations not expect. data engine process
collect edge cases, go back drawing board learn
them. create data pipeline cars, hundreds
thousands cars driving around something weird happens. whenever
weird detector fires, another important concept, piece data goes back
mothership training, retraining system. data
engine process, keeps improving getting better better better better.
basically send pretty clever AI systems world let find
edge cases, let screw just enough figure edge cases are,
go back learn them, send new version keep updating
version. - updating done humans? - annotation done humans.
The, to, weird examples come back, edge cases,
label actually happened there. also mechanisms automatically
labeling, mostly, think always rely humans improve,
understand happening weird cases. lot debate.
this, thing, artificial intelligence? bunch smart people
different opinions intelligence. AI basically community
people don't agree anything. - seems case. First all,
beautiful description terms heard many times among colleagues
Stanford, meetings outside world. many fascinating things.
many questions, want ask one question culture AI,
seem community least outsider, seems
like little consensus terms operational definitions


even mean. seems lot splitting happening now not just
supervised unsupervised learning, sort intermediate conditions
machines autonomous, go back instruction like kids go home
college summer get little, moms still feeds eventually
leave nest kind thing. something particular engineers,
people realm engineering think lends disagreement? - Yeah,
think, so, first all, specific get, less disagreement is.
lot disagreement artificial intelligence, less disagreement
machine learning even less talk active learning
machine teaching self-supervised learning. get like NLP
language models transformers, get specific neural network
architectures, less less less disagreement terms.
might hearing disagreement high-level terms,
fact engineering, especially talking intelligence systems little
bit art science. art part thing creates disagreements,
start disagreements easy difficult particular
problem is. example, lot people disagree Elon difficult problem
autonomous driving is. so, nobody knows. lot disagreement
about, limits techniques? that, terminology also
contains within disagreements. overall, think also young science
also that. like not just engineering, artificial intelligence truly
large-scale discipline, thousands, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands people working it, huge amounts money made recent
thing. trying figure terms. And, course, egos
personalities lot fame made. Like term deep learning, example,
neural networks around many, many decades since '60s, can
argue since '40s. rebranding neural networks word, deep
learning, term, deep learning, part re-invigoration field,
really exact thing. - didn't know that. mean, grew age
neuroscience neural networks discussed, computational neuroscience
theoretical neuroscience, journals. wasn't actually taken terribly
seriously experimentalists years ago. say five seven years
ago. Excellent theoretical neuroscientist like Larry Abbott colleagues, certainly
Stanford well people started paying attention computational methods.


terms, neural networks, computational methods, actually didn't know neural
network works deep learning now become kind synonymous. -
No, always thing. - Interesting. was, so. - neuroscientist
didn't know that. - So, well, neural networks probably means something else
neural science not something else, little different flavor depending field.
fascinating too, neuroscience AI people started working
together dancing lot recent,

00:26:46 Machine & Human Learning

say probably decade. - Oh, machines going brain. couple
questions, one thing sort fixated find incredibly interesting
example gave playing game mutated version competitor.
- Yeah. - find incredibly interesting kind parallel mirror
happens try learn humans, generate repetitions
whatever trying learn, make errors. Occasionally succeed.
simple example, instance, trying throw bulls eyes dartboard. - Yeah. -
going errors, errors, errors. probably miss dartboard. maybe
occasionally, hit bullseye. don't know exactly just did, right?
say playing darts version wearing visual prism,
like visual, visual defect, learn certain things mode well.
saying machine can sort mutate itself, mutation always cause
deficiency needs overcome? mutations biology sometimes give
us super powers, right? Occasionally, get somebody better 2020
vision, can see better 99.9% people there. So, talk
machine playing game mutated version itself, mutation always say
call negative mutation, adaptive maladaptive mutation? - No,
don't know get, so, mutate first figure compete
other. - So, evolving, machine gets evolve real time. -
Yeah. think it, exciting actually humans.
not just. So, usually freeze version system. So, really take Andrew
yesterday make 10 clones them. maybe mutate, maybe not.
bunch competitions Andrew today, like fight
death, wins last. So, love idea like creating bunch clones


like day past year, just seeing going better
like podcasting science, picking chicks bar don't know, competing
Jujitsu. one way it, mean, lot Lexes die
process, essentially happens, reinforcement learning
self-play mechanisms, graveyard systems didn't well.
surviving, good ones survive. - think that, mean, Darwin's Theory
Evolution might worked sense way, population level.
mean, get bunch birds different shaped beaks birds
shaped beak allows get seeds. mean, trivially simple example
Darwinian evolution, think correct even though not exhaustive.
referring to? essentially normally done members
different species, lots different members species different traits get
selected for, actually create multiple versions different
traits. - So, with, probably said this, perhaps implied machine
learning, reinforcement learning processes. One big
requirements, objective function, loss function, utility function,
different terms thing, like equation says good,
trying optimize equation. So, clear goal
systems. - game, like chess, goal. - anything.
Anything want machine learning solve, needs objective function.
machine learning, usually called Loss Function, optimizing.
interesting thing evolution, complicated course, goal also seems
evolving. Like a, guess, adaptation environment, goal,
unclear can convert always. like survival fittest. unclear
fittest is. machine learning, starting point, like human ingenuity
provides, fitness function good bad, lets know
systems going win. So, need equation like that. One
fascinating things humans, figure objective functions ourselves.
Like meaning life, like hell here? machine currently
hard-coded statement why. - meaning of- - Yeah. -
Artificial intelligence-based life. - Right. can't. So, like lot interesting
explorations function curiosity, learning new things
kind stuff, still hard coded. want machine able
good stuff, given clear statements good stuff means.


one challenges artificial intelligence, formalize the, order
solve problem, formalize provide like full
sensory information, clear data
collected, also clear objective function.

00:32:21 Curiosity

goal trying reach? difficult thing artificial
intelligence. - love mentioned curiosity, sure definition falls short
many ways, define curiosity strong interest knowing something, without
attachment outcome. sort a, random search, not
really emotional attachment, really just desire discover unveil
without hoping gold coin rock, just looking rocks.
less the, within machine learning, sounds like elements
reward prediction rewards. machine know done right thing.
So, can make machines curious, sorts machines
describing, curious design? - Yeah, curiosity kind symptom, not goal. So,
happens, one big trade-offs reinforcement learning, exploration
versus exploitation. So, know little, pays off explore lot, even
suboptimal, like even trajectories seem like not going lead anywhere,
called exploration. smarter smarter smarter get,
emphasis put exploitation, meaning take best solution, take best
path. Now, process, exploration can look like curiosity us humans,
really just trying get local optimal, thing already discovered.
AI perspective, always looking optimize objective function, derives,
can talk slot more, terms tools machine learning today,
derives no pleasure just curiosity like, don't know, discovery. - So,
no dopamine machine learning. - no dopamine. - no reward, system
chemical, guess electronic-reward system. - said, look machine
learning literature reinforcement learning literature, will use, like deep mind,
use terms like dopamine, constantly trying use human brain inspire totally
new solutions problems. So, think like, dopamine function
human brain, can lead interesting ways discover optimal
solutions? ultimately currently, formal objective function. Now,


argue humans also set objective functions try optimize,
just not able introspect them. - Yeah, don't actually know looking
seeking doing. - Well, like Lisa Feldman Barrett spoken least
Instagram, hope you- - met you, yeah. - Yeah, hope actually
podcast. - Yes, terrific. - So, very,
homeostasis like that. Basically, dumb objective function brain
trying optimize, like keep like body temperature same. Like dom
kind optimization function happening. humans fancy
consciousness cognitive abilities, tell stories can nice
podcasts, really brain trying maintain a, just like healthy state, guess.
fascinating. also see human brain, hope artificial intelligence systems,
not just systems solve problems, optimize goal, also storytellers.
think power telling stories. tell stories other,
communication is. Like alone, solve problems,
makes sense talk solving problems. community,
capability communicate, tell stories, share ideas way ideas
stable long period time, like, charismatic storyteller.
think humans good this. Arguably, argue
are, great storytellers. AI hope will also become that. So, not
just able solve problems clear objective function,

00:36:55 Story Telling Robots

afterwards, able tell like way better, like make way better story
something, failed. - So, think robots or, and/or
machines sort going start telling human stories? - Well, definitely. So,
technical field called Explainable AI, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, trying
figure get AI system explain us humans hell failed,
succeeded, lot different sort versions this, visualize
understands world. really difficult problem, especially neural networks
famously opaque, don't understand many cases, particular
neural network well, try figure going fail,
requires AI explain itself. huge amount money, like huge
amount money this, especially government funding on.


want deploy AI systems real world, humans least, want ask
question like, hell that? Like dark way, just kill
person, right? Like car ran person, want understand happened.
now again, sometimes unfair AI systems humans can
often not explain well. field Explainable AI people
interested rely AI systems, like Twitter
recommender system, AI algorithm that's, say impacting elections, perhaps
starting wars, least military conflict, algorithm, want ask algorithm,
first all, know hell doing? understand society-level
effects having? can explain possible trajectories? Like
kind conversation human, want able
AI. personal level, think nice talk AI systems stupid
stuff, like robots fail to- - Why'd fall stairs? - Yeah. not
engineering question, almost like endearing question, like looking for, fell
hanging out, don't think need explanation exactly
dynamics, like actuated system problem here? Like
texture floor? on. like, the- - No, want know
thinking. - That, might joke like, drunk again, go home, something,
like humor it, opportunity. Like storytelling, isn't just
explanation happened, something makes people laugh, makes people
fall love, makes people dream, understand things way poetry makes
people understand things opposed rigorous log every sensor was,
every actuator was. - mean, find incredible one hallmarks
severe autism spectrum disorders is, report experience autistic person
much catalog action steps. like, feel today? say,
well, got this, this, this. not way
person doesn't autism spectrum disorder respond. way
describe machines much humanism,

00:40:48 Defines Robot?

much human biological element, realized talking
machines. want make sure understand distinction
machine learns, machine artificial intelligence robot. Like point


machine become robot? So, ballpoint pen, assuming wouldn't
call robot, ballpoint pen can come moved opposite
side table, moves whatever mechanism, point, become
robot? - Okay, 1 million ways explore question. fascinating one. So,
first all, question life? Like know something living
form not? question sort a, maybe cold
computational system becomes a, already loading words lot meaning,
robot machine, So, one, think movement important, kind boring
idea robot just machine able act world. So, one artificial
intelligence just thinking thing, think machine learning
is, also acting thing, usually think robots. So, robots
things perception system able take world however
define world, able think learn whatever hell inside,
act world. So, difference maybe AI system learning
machine robot, something able, robot something able
perceive world act world. - So, language sound,
movement both. - Yeah. think also digital
space long aspect entity inside machine world
outside machine. sense machine sensing world
acting it. - So, could, instance, version robot, according
definition think providing, robot, go sleep night
robot goes forges information thinks want see loaded onto
desktop morning. no movement machine, no
language, essentially, movement cyberspace. - Yeah, distinction
think important element entity, whether
digital physical space. So, something like Alexa home,
speech recognition, Alexa doing, constantly sent
back mothership. Alexa own, me, robot,
interacting world. simply finger main mothership,
Alexa not robot, just interaction device, may main
Amazon Alexa AI, big, big system robot. So, important
element, us humans, think, want entity, whether
digital physical space, ideas consciousness come
kinds things project understanding means being.



00:44:30 Magic & Surprise

so, take further, machine become robot, think
special moment. special moment person's life robot's life
surprises you. think surprise really powerful thing, know thing
works yet surprises you, magical moment us humans. So, whether
chess-playing program something haven't seen before, makes
people smile like, huh, moments happen AlphaZero first time chess
playing, grand masters really surprised move. didn't understand
move studied studied understood it.
moment surprise, grandmasters chess. find moment surprise
really powerful, really magical just everyday life. - supersedes human
brain moment? - So, not supersedes, like outperforms, surprises
positive sense. Like didn't think that, didn't think you.
think moment big transition robot moment servant
accomplishes particular task level accuracy, rate
failure, entity, struggling just like world.
really important moment think not going find many people AI
community talk like just did. not speaking like philosopher hippie,
speaking purely engineering perspective. think really important robots
become entities explore real engineering problem, opposed
everybody treats robots robotics community, don't even call
she, don't give them, try avoid giving names, really want see like
system, like servant. see servant trying accomplish task.
me, don't think just romanticizing notion, think being, currently
perhaps dumb being, long arc history, humans pretty dumb beings
too, so- - agree statement. [Andrew laughing] - So, tend really want
explore treating robots really entities, yeah. So, like anthropomorphization,
sort act looking inanimate object projecting onto life-like
features, think robotics generally sees negative, see superpower. Like
that, need use that. - Well, struck really grabs onto relationship

00:47:37 Robots Change Us



human machine, human robot. So, guess simple question is,
think already told us answer, interacting robot change
you? words, develop relationships robots? - Yeah, definitely think so.
think moment see robot AI systems just servants entities,
begin change you, just like good friends do, just like relationships just
humans. think that, certain aspects interaction. Like
robot's ability say no, sense identity, set goals,
not constantly serving you, instead, trying understand world
dance understanding communication you. So, definitely think a,
mean, lot thoughts may know, core
life-long dream actually want do, believe people
notion loneliness haven't discovered, haven't explored,
say. see AI systems helping us explore can become
better humans, better people towards other. So, think connection
human AI, human robot, not possible, will help us understand
ways like several orders magnitude deeper ever
imagined. tend believe [sighing]

00:49:35 Relationships Defined

well, wild levels belief terms impactful will be, right? - So,
think human relationships, don't always break variables,
explore variables see map human-robot
relationships. One just time, right? spend zero time another person
cyberspace phone person, essentially no relationship them.
spend lot time, relationship, obvious. guess one variable
time, much time spend entity, robot human.
wins successes. enjoy successes together. give absolutely
trivial example moment, failures. struggle
somebody, whether not struggle one another, disagree, like
really struck fact said robot saying no, never thought
robot saying no me, is. - look forward one first people
send robots to. - I. So, struggle. struggle somebody,


grow closer. Sometimes struggles imposed two people,
called trauma bonding, call whole psychology literature pop psychology
literature. case, can imagine. So, time successes together, struggle together,
just peaceful time, hanging home, watching movies, waking near one
another, here, breaking elements relationships kind. So,
think elements apply robot-human relationships? so, see
how, robot entity autonomy terms reacts
you, not just just serve you, not just servant, actually opinions,
can tell maybe thinking flawed, actions flawed. - can
also leave. - also leave. So, never conceptualized robot-human interactions
way. So, tell might look. thinking human-
appearing robot? know intense relationships our,
separate dogs obviously, animals, sounds lot like human-animal interaction.
So, ideal human-robot relationship? - So, lot said here,
actually pinpointed one big, big first steps, idea time.
huge limitation machine-learning community currently. Now back like
actual details. Life-long learning problem space focuses AI systems can
learn long period time. currently machine learning systems not
able do, things listed time, successes, failures,
just chilling together watching movies, AI systems not able that,
beautiful, magical moments believe days filled with, not able keep
track together you. - 'Cause can't move you. -
No, no, like literally don't techniques learning, actual learning
containing moments. Current machine-learning systems really focused
understanding world following way, like perception system, like
looking around, understand like scene. bunch people
sitting down, cameras microphones, table, understand
that. fact shared moment talking today, still remember
like next time something, remember moment happened. don't
know technique-wise. hoping innovate think
very, important component means create deeper relationship,
sharing moments together. - post photo robot, like selfie
robot robot sees image recognizes time spent,
smiles, tears- - Yeah. - create sort metric emotional depth


relationship update behavior? - So. - it... texts middle
night say, haven't texted back? - Well, yes, things,
can dig that. think time element, forget everything else, just sharing
moments together, changes everything. believe changes everything. Now,
specific things terms systems can explain you.
technical probably little bit offline, 'cause kind wild ideas can
revolutionize social networks operating systems. point element alone,
forget things talking like emotions, saying no, that, just
remembering sharing moments together change everything. don't currently
systems share moments together. Like even just fridge, just
times, went late night ate thing shouldn't eaten,
secret moment refrigerator. shared moment, darkness
beautiful moment just like heartbroken reason,
eating ice cream whatever, special moment. refrigerator
you, fact missed opportunity remember tragic.
remember that, think going attached refrigerator.
going go hell refrigerator. us have, like
developed world, weird relationships food, right? So, can go
deep moments trauma triumph food, core that,
refrigerator. So, smart refrigerator, believe change society. Not just
refrigerator, ideas systems around us. So, just want comment
powerful idea time is. bunch elements actual
interaction allowing human feel like heard. Truly heard, truly
understood, human, like deep friendship like that, think, still
element selfishness, still element not really able understand
another human. lot times going trauma together,
difficult times successes, actually starting get inkling
understanding other, think done aggressively,
efficiently. Like think great therapist, think never actually
therapist, believer used want psychiatrist. - Russians go
therapists? - No, don't. don't. do, therapist don't live tell
story. believe talk therapy, friendship me, talk therapy, like
don't even necessarily need talk [laughing] like just connecting
space ideas space experiences. think lot ideas


make AI systems able ask right questions truly hear another human.
try podcasting, right? think ways AI.
else, just remembering collection moments make day,
week, months, think maybe well. closest
friends still friends high school. time, bunch
together, like different people. just fact
that, remember moments, moments somehow create
depth connection like nothing else, like refrigerator. - love
graduate advisor, unfortunately, passed away, passed away,
somebody said memorial amazing things done, et cetera.
kids got there, young children knew
pregnant them. so, really, even now can feel like heart
gets heavy, thinking this, going grow without mother.
really amazing, strong young girls, now young women. said
incredible, said really appreciated mother,
amazing person, unstructured time spent together. - Mm-hmm. - So,
wasn't trips zoo, wasn't woke five morning drove us
school. things too. two hour commute direction,
incredible, ran lab, et cetera, unstructured time. So, passing
mother, remembered biggest give bonded
her, time just kind hung out. way describe
relationship refrigerator so, want say human-like, almost reluctant
say that. realizing talking, think
human-like might actually lower form relationship. may relationships
far better sorts relationships can conceive minds right
now based machine relationship interactions teach us.
right? - Yeah, think so. think no reason see machines somehow
incapable teaching us something deeply human. don't think humans
monopoly that. think understand poorly need
kind prompting machine. definitely part that, just remembering
moments. think unstructured time together, wonder quite unstructured.
like calling podcast structured time. - Maybe meant,
wasn't big outing, no specific goal, goal created lack
goal. Like just hang start playing, thumb war,


end playing thumb war hour. So, structure emerges lack
structure. - No, thing moments, something times
creates special moments, think optimized for. think think like
big outing as, don't know, going Six Flags something, big, Grand
Canyon, go some, don't know, think need to, don't quite yet
understand, humans, creates magical moments. think possible optimize
lot things. perhaps like podcasting helping people discover that, like
maybe thing want optimize isn't necessarily like sexy, like quick clips,
maybe want, long-form authenticity. - Depth. - Depth. So, trying
figure out, certainly deep connection humans humans NAS
systems, think long conversations, long periods communication series
moments like new, perhaps, seemingly insignificant big ones, big
successes, big failures, just stitching together talking
throughout. think formula really, really deep connection. like
specific engineering perspective, think fascinating open problem
really worked much. me, a, guts

01:02:29 Lex’s Dream Humanity

and, mean lot things say, one guts, build startup around
it. - So, talk startup talk dream. mentioned
dream previous conversations, always little hints dropped
there. Just anyone listening, never offline conversation
dream, not privy anything, except Lex says now. realized
no way capture full essence dream kind verbal statement way
captures it. dream referred now several times
sat together talked phone? Maybe company,
maybe something distinct. feel comfortable, it'd great share
little bit is. - Sure. So, way people express long-term vision,
noticed quite different. Like Elon example somebody can crisply say
exactly goal is. Also fact problems solving
nothing humans. So, long-term vision little bit difficult express
words, noticed, tried, brain's failure, way
sneak it. So, let just say things. Early life also recent


years, interacted robots understood magic there.
magic shared millions brought light. first met Spot
Boston Dynamics, realized magic nobody else seeing. - dog.
- dog, sorry. Spot four-legged robot Boston Dynamics. people
might seen it, yellow dog. sometimes life, just notice something
just grabs you. believe something magic something
every single device world. way think maybe Steve Jobs
thought personal computer, laws didn't think personal computer
way, Steve did. like, thought personal computer
thin sheet paper everybody one, idea, think
heartbreaking getting, world filled machines
soulless. think every one can magic. One things
also inspired terms startup, magic can engineered much easier
thought. intuition everything ever built worked on. So, dream
add bit magic every single computing system world. So, way
Windows Operating System long time primary operating system
everybody interacted with, built apps top it. think something
layer, almost operating system every device humans
interacted world. Now, actually looks like, actual dream
officially kid, didn't concrete form business, dream
exploring loneliness interacting machines, robots. deep
connection humans robots always dream. so, me, love
see world every home robot, not robot washes
dishes, sex robot, don't know, think kind activity robot can do,
like companion. - family member. - family member, way dog is. - Mm-
hmm. - dog able speak language too. So, not just connect way
dog looking looking away almost like smiling soul
kind way, also actually understand hell, like, excited
successes? Like understand details, understand traumas. that,
just think [sighing] always filled excitement could, artificial
intelligence, bring joy lot people. recently,
heartbroken see kind division, derision, even hate boiling
internet social networks. thought kind mechanism exactly
applicable context social networks well. So, operating system


serves guide internet. One biggest problems YouTube
social networks currently, optimizing engagement. think create AI
systems know individual person, able optimize long-term growth
long-term happiness. - individual, or- - individual, individual.
lot things say, order AI systems learn
everything you, need collect, need just like talk
offline, collecting data others secrets other, way
AI that. allows to, requires rethink ideas
ownership data. think individual data easily
able leave just like AI systems can leave, humans can disappear delete
data moment's notice. actually better humans can do,
load data other, there. think important both, give people
complete control data order establish trust can trust you.
second part trust transparency. Whenever data used make clear
used for. not clear lawyerly legal sense, clear way
people really understand used for. believe people ability
delete data walk away know data used, think
stay. - possibility clean breakup, actually will keep people together. -
Yeah, think so. think, exactly. think happy marriage acquires ability divorce
easily without divorce industrial complex whatever. Things currently going
much money made lawyers divorce. yeah, ability
leave enables love, think. - interesting. heard phrase semi-
cynical friend, marriage leading cause divorce, now heard
divorce, possibility divorce leading cause marriage. - happy
marriage. - Good point. - happy marriage. So, yeah. So, lot details
there, big dream connection AI system human.
haven't. much fear artificial intelligence systems robots
haven't quite found right words express vision vision have,
not like naive, delusional vision like technology going save everybody,
really just positive view ways AI systems can help humans explore
themselves. - love positivity agree stance everything doomed
equally bad say everything's going turn right, dedicated
effort. clearly, thinking dedicated effort look like.
mentioned two aspects dream [clears throat] want make sure


understand connect do, independent streams. One
hypothetical robot family member, form robot allow
people experience kind delight experienced many times,

01:11:33 Improving Social Media

like world able have, beautiful idea
give. social media social network platforms really serve
individuals best selves happiness growth. crossover
those, two parallel dreams? - 100% thing.
difficult kind explain without going details, maybe one easy way
explain way think social networks, create AI system yours.
not like Amazon Alexa centralized, data, like little friend
becomes representative Twitter helps find things will make feel
good, will also challenge thinking make grow, not get that, not let
get lost negative spiral dopamine, gets angry, just
get not open learning. so, little representative optimizing
long-term health. believe not good human beings, also good
business. think longterm, can make lot money challenging idea
way make money, maximizing engagement. one things
people disagree on, think Twitter's always going win. Like maximizing
engagement always going win, don't think so. think people woken now
understanding that, like don't always feel good, ones Twitter lot,
don't always feel good end week. - love feedback
whatever creature, whatever, don't know call it, maybe end
week, automatically unfollow people follow
realized really smart data feeling inside,
sleeping, something that, don't know, just wasn't good me. might also
put things people front see, kind sliver
look like? - whole point, interaction, sharing moments
learning lot you, now able understand interactions led
become better version yourself. Like person happy with.
isn't, flat earth feel good it, believe earth
flat, like idea sensor ridiculous. makes feel good


becoming best version yourself, think getting much flat
earth possible. Now, also good challenge ideas, not
centralized committee decided, tell system like
challenging ideas, think us do. then, actually YouTube doesn't
well, go flat-earth rabbit hole, going see.
nice get really powerful communicators argue flat earth. nice
see you, potentially, least long-term expand horizons, maybe
earth not flat. continue live whole life thinking earth flat,
think, good father son daughter, like best
version happy yourself, think earth flat. So, like think
kind idea, just using kind silly, ridiculous example don't
like idea centralized forces controlling can can't see, also don't
like idea like not censoring anything. always biggest problem
that, central decider, think can decide want
see not, good companion reminds felt last time
this, felt good last time this. - Man, feel like every good story,
guide companion flies out, forges little bit further, little bit
differently brings back information helps us, least tries steer us
right direction. - So, yeah, exactly thinking working on.
mention bunch difficulties here, see little bit
recently. So, technically lot challenges here. Just like lot
technologies, reason talking podcast comfortably opposed
working secret, really hard maybe time not come.
something constantly struggle terms like entrepreneurially
startup, like also mentioned you, maybe offline, really don't care money,

01:16:57 Challenges Creativity

don't care business success, kinds things. So, difficult decision
make, much time want go give everything
this? big roll dice. also realized working
problems, robotics technical side terms machine-learning
system describing, lonely, really lonely. personal level
technical level. So, technical level, surrounded people kind


doubt me, think entrepreneurs go through. doubt following
sense, know difficult is. Like people colleagues mine,
know difficult life-long learning is, also know difficult build system
like this, build competitive social network. general, kind
loneliness just working something long periods time.
start doubt whether, given don't track record success, like
big one. look mirror, especially young, still
that, things, look mirror, like, big dreams,
know actually smart think are? Like know
going able accomplish dream? ambition. - sort don't,
kind pulling string hoping bigger ball yarn. - Yeah.
[Andrew laughing] kind intuition. think pride knowing
good at, reason intuition, 'cause think good
knowing things suck at, basically everything. So, like whenever
notice like, wait minute, kind good this, rare me. think like
that, might ball yarn worth pulling at. thing terms
engineering systems able interact humans, think good that.
talk podcasting on, don't know good
podcasts. - good podcasting, right? - certainly don't, think maybe
compelling people watch kindhearted idiot struggle form, maybe
compelling. terms like actual good engineer human-robot
interaction systems, think good. hard know it,
world keeps telling not, full doll, really hard.
struggling recently, kind fascinating struggle.
Goggins thing comes in, like, aside state-hard motherfucker, the, like
whenever struggling, good sign keep going, going
alone success, right? - Well, case, however, agree. actually David
post recently thought among many brilliant posts, one
brilliant talked myth light end tunnel.
instead, replaced myth with, concept eventually, eyes
adapt dark. tunnel, not light end, really
adapting dark tunnel. Goggins- - love much. - Yeah.
got share lot common knowing bit, share lot common.
loneliness pursuit dream, seems me, certain component


extremely valuable, loneliness serve driver
build companion journey. - Well, deeply aware that. So, like
people can make, 'cause talk love lot, really love everything world,
also love humans, friendship romantic, like even cheesy stuff, just- - like
romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, got much Rogan
like, Tango scene "Scent Woman,"

01:21:49 Suits & Dresses

find like nothing better woman red dress, just like classy- -
move Argentina friend. father's Argentine, know
said went podcast first time? said, dresses well.
Argentina, men go wedding party something, U.S., halfway
night, 10 minutes night, jackets off. - Yeah. - looks like
everyone's undressing party just got dressed for. said, know,
liked way dresses. started, talking you.
started podcast, said, don't wear real suit like friend Lex?

01:22:22 Loneliness

[laughing] - remember that. - No, can't. talk pursuit just bit
more, think talking about, building a, not just solution
loneliness, alluded loneliness itself, important thing. think
right. think within people, like caverns faults shame, also just
desire resonance, seen heard. don't even know seen
heard language. reservoirs loneliness, think, well,
interesting, maybe comment little bit it. just often
talk love, haven't quantified it, seems talk loneliness,
maybe just willing, share little bit that,
feels like now pursuit building robot-human relationship. been,
let direct, spending lot time building robot-human
relationship, at? - Oh, terms business, terms systems? - No,
talking specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, mention things.
So, one, startup idea hope millions people can use.


personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going
stairs, saw slip. big guy, wasn't 200 pounds,
90 pounds, bulldog, pretty big fit. noticed
wasn't carrying foot back like injured, no feeling all.
never liked touch hind paws, do, thing just flopping there.
vet found spinal degeneration told next one
go. suffer? Sure, hope not, something changed eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah,
eyes again, know spend long hours phone tell
like eyes convey mean internal states


sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking
Costello peeing. losing ability stand that, falling
that. think started realize. passage easy
peaceful, say this, not ashamed say it, mean, wake every morning
since just, don't even make conscious decision allow self cry, wake
crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief
moment. - Yeah. gone. - the, going gone lot people
too. - Well, struggling with. think maybe pretty good this.
Like, done before? [Andrew laughing] challenge. actually
part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship

00:07:35 Artificial Intelligence?

claim special offer. now, conversation Dr. Lex Fridman. - meet
again. - meet again. Thanks much sitting me. question
think lot people's minds lot people's minds,
hear terms lot days, think people, including scientists
including don't know really artificial intelligence, different
things like machine learning robotics? So, kind explain
us, artificial intelligence, machine learning? - Well, think
question complicated fascinating question of, intelligence?
So, think artificial intelligence, first, big philosophical thing. Pamela McCormick
said AI ancient wish forge gods, born ancient wish forge
gods. think big philosophical level, longing create
intelligence systems. Perhaps systems powerful us. narrow level,
think also set tools computational mathematical tools automate
different tasks. also attempt understand mind. So, build
systems exhibit intelligent behavior order understand intelligence
selves. things true. course, AI really means
community, set researchers engineers, set tools, set
computational techniques allow solve various problems. long
history approaches problem different perspectives. always
throughout one threads, one communities goes flag machine
learning, emphasizing AI space, task learning. make
machine knows little beginning, follow kind process learns
become better better particular task? effective
recent 15 years set techniques fall flag deep learning
utilize neural networks. networks fascinating things inspired
structure human brain, loosely, a, network little


basic computational units called neurons, artificial neurons. have,
architectures input output. know nothing beginning,
task learning something interesting. something interesting is, usually
involves particular task. lot ways talk break down.
Like one much human supervision required teach thing.
supervised learning broad category, neural network knows nothing
beginning given bunch examples computer vision will
examples cats, dogs, cars, traffic signs, given image
given ground truth image. get large database
image examples know truth, neural network able learn
example, called supervised learning. lot fascinating questions within
that, is, provide truth? given image cat,
provide computer image contains cat? just say entire
image picture cat? commonly done,
bounding box, crude box around cat's face saying, cat?
semantic segmentation? Mind you, 2D image cat. not,
computer knows nothing three-dimensional world, just looking set
pixels. So, semantic segmentation drawing nice, crisp outline around cat
saying, cat. really difficult provide truth. one
fundamental open questions computer vision is, even good representation
truth? Now, another contrasting set ideas attention
overlapping is, well, used called unsupervised learning. commonly now
called self-supervised learning. trying get less less less human
supervision task. self-supervised learning more, successful
domain language model, natural English processing, now
successful computer vision task. idea is, let machine
without ground-truth annotation just look pictures internet, look texts
internet try learn something generalizable ideas
core language core vision. based that, humans best like
call common sense. this, giant base knowledge top
build sophisticated knowledge. kind commonsense
knowledge. idea self-supervised learning build commonsense
knowledge about, fundamental visual ideas make cat dog
kinds things without ever human supervision? dream


the, just let AI system self supervised run around internet awhile,
watch YouTube videos millions millions hours, without supervision
primed ready actually learn examples human able
show up. think children way, human children, parents give one
two examples teach concept. dream self-supervised learning will
machines. watch millions hours YouTube videos,
come human able understand human shows them,
cat. Like, remember this' cat. will understand cat not just thing
pointy ears, cat thing orange, furry, see something
fundamental humans might not actually able introspect understand.
Like, asked you, makes cat versus dog, wouldn't probably not able
answer that, showed you, brought cat dog, able tell
difference. ideas brain uses make difference?
whole dream self-supervised learning, able learn own.
set commonsense knowledge, able tell difference.
like lot incredible uses self-supervised learning, weirdly called self-play
mechanism. mechanism behind reinforcement learning successes
systems won Go, at, AlphaZero won chess. - Oh, see. play games? -
[Lex] play games. - Got it. - idea self-play probably, applies
domains just games. system just plays itself. fascinating
kinds domains, knows nothing beginning. whole idea
creates bunch mutations plays versions itself.
fascinating thing play systems little bit better you,
start get better yourself. Like learning, learning happens. true
martial arts. true lot cases. want interacting systems
just little better you. process interacting systems
just little better you, start following process everybody starts
getting better better better better several orders magnitude
better world champion chess, example. fascinating
like runaway system. One terrifying exciting things David Silver,
creator AlphaGo AlphaZero, one leaders team said, a,
haven't found ceiling AlphaZero. Meaning just arbitrarily keep
improving. Now, realm chess, doesn't matter us. like, just ran
away game chess. Like like just much better humans.


question what, can create realm bigger, deeper
effect human beings societies, can terrifying process. me,
exciting process supervise correctly, inject, called value
alignment, make sure goals AI optimizing aligned human
beings human societies. lot fascinating things talk within
specifics neural networks problems people working on.
say really big, exciting one self-supervised learning. trying get less
less human supervision, less less human supervision neural networks. also
just comment shut up. - No, please keep going. learning. questions,
learning. please keep going. - So, exciting not theory,
always application. One exciting applications artificial intelligence,
specifically neural networks machine learning Tesla Autopilot.
systems working real world. isn't academic exercise.
human lives stake. safety-critical. - automated vehicles.
Autonomous vehicles. - Semi-autonomous. want be. - Okay. - gone
wars topics, - Semi-autonomous vehicles. - Semi-autonomous. So,
even though called FSD, Full Self-Driving, currently not fully autonomous,
meaning human supervision required. So, human tasked overseeing
systems. fact, liability-wise, human always responsible. human factor
psychology question, fascinating. fascinated whole space,
whole 'nother space human robot interaction AI systems humans work
together accomplish tasks. dance one smaller communities,
think will one important open problems solved,
humans robots dance together. me, semi-autonomous driving one
spaces. Elon, example, doesn't see way, sees semi-autonomous
driving stepping stone towards fully autonomous driving. Like, humans robots
can't dance well together. Like, humans humans dance robots robots
dance. Like, need to, engineering problem, need design perfect
robot solves problem. forever, maybe not case driving,
world going full problems always humans robots interact,
think robots will always flawed, just like humans going flawed,
flawed. makes life beautiful, flawed. learning
happens edge capabilities. always figure out, can
flawed robots flawed humans interact together they, like sum bigger


whole, opposed focusing just building perfect robot? - Mm-hmm. -
one exciting applications say artificial intelligence
autonomous driving, semi-autonomous driving. really good example
machine learning systems constantly learning. process
maybe can comment on, the, Andrej Karpathy head autopilot
calls data engine. process applies lot machine learning,
build system pretty good stuff, send real world,
starts stuff runs called edge cases, like failure cases,
screws up. kids. have- - adults. -
adults. Exactly. learn really quickly. whole point,
fascinating thing driving, realize millions edge cases. just
like weird situations not expect. data engine process
collect edge cases, go back drawing board learn
them. create data pipeline cars, hundreds
thousands cars driving around something weird happens. whenever
weird detector fires, another important concept, piece data goes back
mothership training, retraining system. data
engine process, keeps improving getting better better better better.
basically send pretty clever AI systems world let find
edge cases, let screw just enough figure edge cases are,
go back learn them, send new version keep updating
version. - updating done humans? - annotation done humans.
The, to, weird examples come back, edge cases,
label actually happened there. also mechanisms automatically
labeling, mostly, think always rely humans improve,
understand happening weird cases. lot debate.
this, thing, artificial intelligence? bunch smart people
different opinions intelligence. AI basically community
people don't agree anything. - seems case. First all,
beautiful description terms heard many times among colleagues
Stanford, meetings outside world. many fascinating things.
many questions, want ask one question culture AI,
seem community least outsider, seems
like little consensus terms operational definitions


even mean. seems lot splitting happening now not just
supervised unsupervised learning, sort intermediate conditions
machines autonomous, go back instruction like kids go home
college summer get little, moms still feeds eventually
leave nest kind thing. something particular engineers,
people realm engineering think lends disagreement? - Yeah,
think, so, first all, specific get, less disagreement is.
lot disagreement artificial intelligence, less disagreement
machine learning even less talk active learning
machine teaching self-supervised learning. get like NLP
language models transformers, get specific neural network
architectures, less less less disagreement terms.
might hearing disagreement high-level terms,
fact engineering, especially talking intelligence systems little
bit art science. art part thing creates disagreements,
start disagreements easy difficult particular
problem is. example, lot people disagree Elon difficult problem
autonomous driving is. so, nobody knows. lot disagreement
about, limits techniques? that, terminology also
contains within disagreements. overall, think also young science
also that. like not just engineering, artificial intelligence truly
large-scale discipline, thousands, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands people working it, huge amounts money made recent
thing. trying figure terms. And, course, egos
personalities lot fame made. Like term deep learning, example,
neural networks around many, many decades since '60s, can
argue since '40s. rebranding neural networks word, deep
learning, term, deep learning, part re-invigoration field,
really exact thing. - didn't know that. mean, grew age
neuroscience neural networks discussed, computational neuroscience
theoretical neuroscience, journals. wasn't actually taken terribly
seriously experimentalists years ago. say five seven years
ago. Excellent theoretical neuroscientist like Larry Abbott colleagues, certainly
Stanford well people started paying attention computational methods.


terms, neural networks, computational methods, actually didn't know neural
network works deep learning now become kind synonymous. -
No, always thing. - Interesting. was, so. - neuroscientist
didn't know that. - So, well, neural networks probably means something else
neural science not something else, little different flavor depending field.
fascinating too, neuroscience AI people started working
together dancing lot recent,

00:26:46 Machine & Human Learning

say probably decade. - Oh, machines going brain. couple
questions, one thing sort fixated find incredibly interesting
example gave playing game mutated version competitor.
- Yeah. - find incredibly interesting kind parallel mirror
happens try learn humans, generate repetitions
whatever trying learn, make errors. Occasionally succeed.
simple example, instance, trying throw bulls eyes dartboard. - Yeah. -
going errors, errors, errors. probably miss dartboard. maybe
occasionally, hit bullseye. don't know exactly just did, right?
say playing darts version wearing visual prism,
like visual, visual defect, learn certain things mode well.
saying machine can sort mutate itself, mutation always cause
deficiency needs overcome? mutations biology sometimes give
us super powers, right? Occasionally, get somebody better 2020
vision, can see better 99.9% people there. So, talk
machine playing game mutated version itself, mutation always say
call negative mutation, adaptive maladaptive mutation? - No,
don't know get, so, mutate first figure compete
other. - So, evolving, machine gets evolve real time. -
Yeah. think it, exciting actually humans.
not just. So, usually freeze version system. So, really take Andrew
yesterday make 10 clones them. maybe mutate, maybe not.
bunch competitions Andrew today, like fight
death, wins last. So, love idea like creating bunch clones


like day past year, just seeing going better
like podcasting science, picking chicks bar don't know, competing
Jujitsu. one way it, mean, lot Lexes die
process, essentially happens, reinforcement learning
self-play mechanisms, graveyard systems didn't well.
surviving, good ones survive. - think that, mean, Darwin's Theory
Evolution might worked sense way, population level.
mean, get bunch birds different shaped beaks birds
shaped beak allows get seeds. mean, trivially simple example
Darwinian evolution, think correct even though not exhaustive.
referring to? essentially normally done members
different species, lots different members species different traits get
selected for, actually create multiple versions different
traits. - So, with, probably said this, perhaps implied machine
learning, reinforcement learning processes. One big
requirements, objective function, loss function, utility function,
different terms thing, like equation says good,
trying optimize equation. So, clear goal
systems. - game, like chess, goal. - anything.
Anything want machine learning solve, needs objective function.
machine learning, usually called Loss Function, optimizing.
interesting thing evolution, complicated course, goal also seems
evolving. Like a, guess, adaptation environment, goal,
unclear can convert always. like survival fittest. unclear
fittest is. machine learning, starting point, like human ingenuity
provides, fitness function good bad, lets know
systems going win. So, need equation like that. One
fascinating things humans, figure objective functions ourselves.
Like meaning life, like hell here? machine currently
hard-coded statement why. - meaning of- - Yeah. -
Artificial intelligence-based life. - Right. can't. So, like lot interesting
explorations function curiosity, learning new things
kind stuff, still hard coded. want machine able
good stuff, given clear statements good stuff means.


one challenges artificial intelligence, formalize the, order
solve problem, formalize provide like full
sensory information, clear data
collected, also clear objective function.

00:32:21 Curiosity

goal trying reach? difficult thing artificial
intelligence. - love mentioned curiosity, sure definition falls short
many ways, define curiosity strong interest knowing something, without
attachment outcome. sort a, random search, not
really emotional attachment, really just desire discover unveil
without hoping gold coin rock, just looking rocks.
less the, within machine learning, sounds like elements
reward prediction rewards. machine know done right thing.
So, can make machines curious, sorts machines
describing, curious design? - Yeah, curiosity kind symptom, not goal. So,
happens, one big trade-offs reinforcement learning, exploration
versus exploitation. So, know little, pays off explore lot, even
suboptimal, like even trajectories seem like not going lead anywhere,
called exploration. smarter smarter smarter get,
emphasis put exploitation, meaning take best solution, take best
path. Now, process, exploration can look like curiosity us humans,
really just trying get local optimal, thing already discovered.
AI perspective, always looking optimize objective function, derives,
can talk slot more, terms tools machine learning today,
derives no pleasure just curiosity like, don't know, discovery. - So,
no dopamine machine learning. - no dopamine. - no reward, system
chemical, guess electronic-reward system. - said, look machine
learning literature reinforcement learning literature, will use, like deep mind,
use terms like dopamine, constantly trying use human brain inspire totally
new solutions problems. So, think like, dopamine function
human brain, can lead interesting ways discover optimal
solutions? ultimately currently, formal objective function. Now,


argue humans also set objective functions try optimize,
just not able introspect them. - Yeah, don't actually know looking
seeking doing. - Well, like Lisa Feldman Barrett spoken least
Instagram, hope you- - met you, yeah. - Yeah, hope actually
podcast. - Yes, terrific. - So, very,
homeostasis like that. Basically, dumb objective function brain
trying optimize, like keep like body temperature same. Like dom
kind optimization function happening. humans fancy
consciousness cognitive abilities, tell stories can nice
podcasts, really brain trying maintain a, just like healthy state, guess.
fascinating. also see human brain, hope artificial intelligence systems,
not just systems solve problems, optimize goal, also storytellers.
think power telling stories. tell stories other,
communication is. Like alone, solve problems,
makes sense talk solving problems. community,
capability communicate, tell stories, share ideas way ideas
stable long period time, like, charismatic storyteller.
think humans good this. Arguably, argue
are, great storytellers. AI hope will also become that. So, not
just able solve problems clear objective function,

00:36:55 Story Telling Robots

afterwards, able tell like way better, like make way better story
something, failed. - So, think robots or, and/or
machines sort going start telling human stories? - Well, definitely. So,
technical field called Explainable AI, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, trying
figure get AI system explain us humans hell failed,
succeeded, lot different sort versions this, visualize
understands world. really difficult problem, especially neural networks
famously opaque, don't understand many cases, particular
neural network well, try figure going fail,
requires AI explain itself. huge amount money, like huge
amount money this, especially government funding on.


want deploy AI systems real world, humans least, want ask
question like, hell that? Like dark way, just kill
person, right? Like car ran person, want understand happened.
now again, sometimes unfair AI systems humans can
often not explain well. field Explainable AI people
interested rely AI systems, like Twitter
recommender system, AI algorithm that's, say impacting elections, perhaps
starting wars, least military conflict, algorithm, want ask algorithm,
first all, know hell doing? understand society-level
effects having? can explain possible trajectories? Like
kind conversation human, want able
AI. personal level, think nice talk AI systems stupid
stuff, like robots fail to- - Why'd fall stairs? - Yeah. not
engineering question, almost like endearing question, like looking for, fell
hanging out, don't think need explanation exactly
dynamics, like actuated system problem here? Like
texture floor? on. like, the- - No, want know
thinking. - That, might joke like, drunk again, go home, something,
like humor it, opportunity. Like storytelling, isn't just
explanation happened, something makes people laugh, makes people
fall love, makes people dream, understand things way poetry makes
people understand things opposed rigorous log every sensor was,
every actuator was. - mean, find incredible one hallmarks
severe autism spectrum disorders is, report experience autistic person
much catalog action steps. like, feel today? say,
well, got this, this, this. not way
person doesn't autism spectrum disorder respond. way
describe machines much humanism,

00:40:48 Defines Robot?

much human biological element, realized talking
machines. want make sure understand distinction
machine learns, machine artificial intelligence robot. Like point


machine become robot? So, ballpoint pen, assuming wouldn't
call robot, ballpoint pen can come moved opposite
side table, moves whatever mechanism, point, become
robot? - Okay, 1 million ways explore question. fascinating one. So,
first all, question life? Like know something living
form not? question sort a, maybe cold
computational system becomes a, already loading words lot meaning,
robot machine, So, one, think movement important, kind boring
idea robot just machine able act world. So, one artificial
intelligence just thinking thing, think machine learning
is, also acting thing, usually think robots. So, robots
things perception system able take world however
define world, able think learn whatever hell inside,
act world. So, difference maybe AI system learning
machine robot, something able, robot something able
perceive world act world. - So, language sound,
movement both. - Yeah. think also digital
space long aspect entity inside machine world
outside machine. sense machine sensing world
acting it. - So, could, instance, version robot, according
definition think providing, robot, go sleep night
robot goes forges information thinks want see loaded onto
desktop morning. no movement machine, no
language, essentially, movement cyberspace. - Yeah, distinction
think important element entity, whether
digital physical space. So, something like Alexa home,
speech recognition, Alexa doing, constantly sent
back mothership. Alexa own, me, robot,
interacting world. simply finger main mothership,
Alexa not robot, just interaction device, may main
Amazon Alexa AI, big, big system robot. So, important
element, us humans, think, want entity, whether
digital physical space, ideas consciousness come
kinds things project understanding means being.



00:44:30 Magic & Surprise

so, take further, machine become robot, think
special moment. special moment person's life robot's life
surprises you. think surprise really powerful thing, know thing
works yet surprises you, magical moment us humans. So, whether
chess-playing program something haven't seen before, makes
people smile like, huh, moments happen AlphaZero first time chess
playing, grand masters really surprised move. didn't understand
move studied studied understood it.
moment surprise, grandmasters chess. find moment surprise
really powerful, really magical just everyday life. - supersedes human
brain moment? - So, not supersedes, like outperforms, surprises
positive sense. Like didn't think that, didn't think you.
think moment big transition robot moment servant
accomplishes particular task level accuracy, rate
failure, entity, struggling just like world.
really important moment think not going find many people AI
community talk like just did. not speaking like philosopher hippie,
speaking purely engineering perspective. think really important robots
become entities explore real engineering problem, opposed
everybody treats robots robotics community, don't even call
she, don't give them, try avoid giving names, really want see like
system, like servant. see servant trying accomplish task.
me, don't think just romanticizing notion, think being, currently
perhaps dumb being, long arc history, humans pretty dumb beings
too, so- - agree statement. [Andrew laughing] - So, tend really want
explore treating robots really entities, yeah. So, like anthropomorphization,
sort act looking inanimate object projecting onto life-like
features, think robotics generally sees negative, see superpower. Like
that, need use that. - Well, struck really grabs onto relationship

00:47:37 Robots Change Us



human machine, human robot. So, guess simple question is,
think already told us answer, interacting robot change
you? words, develop relationships robots? - Yeah, definitely think so.
think moment see robot AI systems just servants entities,
begin change you, just like good friends do, just like relationships just
humans. think that, certain aspects interaction. Like
robot's ability say no, sense identity, set goals,
not constantly serving you, instead, trying understand world
dance understanding communication you. So, definitely think a,
mean, lot thoughts may know, core
life-long dream actually want do, believe people
notion loneliness haven't discovered, haven't explored,
say. see AI systems helping us explore can become
better humans, better people towards other. So, think connection
human AI, human robot, not possible, will help us understand
ways like several orders magnitude deeper ever
imagined. tend believe [sighing]

00:49:35 Relationships Defined

well, wild levels belief terms impactful will be, right? - So,
think human relationships, don't always break variables,
explore variables see map human-robot
relationships. One just time, right? spend zero time another person
cyberspace phone person, essentially no relationship them.
spend lot time, relationship, obvious. guess one variable
time, much time spend entity, robot human.
wins successes. enjoy successes together. give absolutely
trivial example moment, failures. struggle
somebody, whether not struggle one another, disagree, like
really struck fact said robot saying no, never thought
robot saying no me, is. - look forward one first people
send robots to. - I. So, struggle. struggle somebody,


grow closer. Sometimes struggles imposed two people,
called trauma bonding, call whole psychology literature pop psychology
literature. case, can imagine. So, time successes together, struggle together,
just peaceful time, hanging home, watching movies, waking near one
another, here, breaking elements relationships kind. So,
think elements apply robot-human relationships? so, see
how, robot entity autonomy terms reacts
you, not just just serve you, not just servant, actually opinions,
can tell maybe thinking flawed, actions flawed. - can
also leave. - also leave. So, never conceptualized robot-human interactions
way. So, tell might look. thinking human-
appearing robot? know intense relationships our,
separate dogs obviously, animals, sounds lot like human-animal interaction.
So, ideal human-robot relationship? - So, lot said here,
actually pinpointed one big, big first steps, idea time.
huge limitation machine-learning community currently. Now back like
actual details. Life-long learning problem space focuses AI systems can
learn long period time. currently machine learning systems not
able do, things listed time, successes, failures,
just chilling together watching movies, AI systems not able that,
beautiful, magical moments believe days filled with, not able keep
track together you. - 'Cause can't move you. -
No, no, like literally don't techniques learning, actual learning
containing moments. Current machine-learning systems really focused
understanding world following way, like perception system, like
looking around, understand like scene. bunch people
sitting down, cameras microphones, table, understand
that. fact shared moment talking today, still remember
like next time something, remember moment happened. don't
know technique-wise. hoping innovate think
very, important component means create deeper relationship,
sharing moments together. - post photo robot, like selfie
robot robot sees image recognizes time spent,
smiles, tears- - Yeah. - create sort metric emotional depth


relationship update behavior? - So. - it... texts middle
night say, haven't texted back? - Well, yes, things,
can dig that. think time element, forget everything else, just sharing
moments together, changes everything. believe changes everything. Now,
specific things terms systems can explain you.
technical probably little bit offline, 'cause kind wild ideas can
revolutionize social networks operating systems. point element alone,
forget things talking like emotions, saying no, that, just
remembering sharing moments together change everything. don't currently
systems share moments together. Like even just fridge, just
times, went late night ate thing shouldn't eaten,
secret moment refrigerator. shared moment, darkness
beautiful moment just like heartbroken reason,
eating ice cream whatever, special moment. refrigerator
you, fact missed opportunity remember tragic.
remember that, think going attached refrigerator.
going go hell refrigerator. us have, like
developed world, weird relationships food, right? So, can go
deep moments trauma triumph food, core that,
refrigerator. So, smart refrigerator, believe change society. Not just
refrigerator, ideas systems around us. So, just want comment
powerful idea time is. bunch elements actual
interaction allowing human feel like heard. Truly heard, truly
understood, human, like deep friendship like that, think, still
element selfishness, still element not really able understand
another human. lot times going trauma together,
difficult times successes, actually starting get inkling
understanding other, think done aggressively,
efficiently. Like think great therapist, think never actually
therapist, believer used want psychiatrist. - Russians go
therapists? - No, don't. don't. do, therapist don't live tell
story. believe talk therapy, friendship me, talk therapy, like
don't even necessarily need talk [laughing] like just connecting
space ideas space experiences. think lot ideas


make AI systems able ask right questions truly hear another human.
try podcasting, right? think ways AI.
else, just remembering collection moments make day,
week, months, think maybe well. closest
friends still friends high school. time, bunch
together, like different people. just fact
that, remember moments, moments somehow create
depth connection like nothing else, like refrigerator. - love
graduate advisor, unfortunately, passed away, passed away,
somebody said memorial amazing things done, et cetera.
kids got there, young children knew
pregnant them. so, really, even now can feel like heart
gets heavy, thinking this, going grow without mother.
really amazing, strong young girls, now young women. said
incredible, said really appreciated mother,
amazing person, unstructured time spent together. - Mm-hmm. - So,
wasn't trips zoo, wasn't woke five morning drove us
school. things too. two hour commute direction,
incredible, ran lab, et cetera, unstructured time. So, passing
mother, remembered biggest give bonded
her, time just kind hung out. way describe
relationship refrigerator so, want say human-like, almost reluctant
say that. realizing talking, think
human-like might actually lower form relationship. may relationships
far better sorts relationships can conceive minds right
now based machine relationship interactions teach us.
right? - Yeah, think so. think no reason see machines somehow
incapable teaching us something deeply human. don't think humans
monopoly that. think understand poorly need
kind prompting machine. definitely part that, just remembering
moments. think unstructured time together, wonder quite unstructured.
like calling podcast structured time. - Maybe meant,
wasn't big outing, no specific goal, goal created lack
goal. Like just hang start playing, thumb war,


end playing thumb war hour. So, structure emerges lack
structure. - No, thing moments, something times
creates special moments, think optimized for. think think like
big outing as, don't know, going Six Flags something, big, Grand
Canyon, go some, don't know, think need to, don't quite yet
understand, humans, creates magical moments. think possible optimize
lot things. perhaps like podcasting helping people discover that, like
maybe thing want optimize isn't necessarily like sexy, like quick clips,
maybe want, long-form authenticity. - Depth. - Depth. So, trying
figure out, certainly deep connection humans humans NAS
systems, think long conversations, long periods communication series
moments like new, perhaps, seemingly insignificant big ones, big
successes, big failures, just stitching together talking
throughout. think formula really, really deep connection. like
specific engineering perspective, think fascinating open problem
really worked much. me, a, guts

01:02:29 Lex’s Dream Humanity

and, mean lot things say, one guts, build startup around
it. - So, talk startup talk dream. mentioned
dream previous conversations, always little hints dropped
there. Just anyone listening, never offline conversation
dream, not privy anything, except Lex says now. realized
no way capture full essence dream kind verbal statement way
captures it. dream referred now several times
sat together talked phone? Maybe company,
maybe something distinct. feel comfortable, it'd great share
little bit is. - Sure. So, way people express long-term vision,
noticed quite different. Like Elon example somebody can crisply say
exactly goal is. Also fact problems solving
nothing humans. So, long-term vision little bit difficult express
words, noticed, tried, brain's failure, way
sneak it. So, let just say things. Early life also recent


years, interacted robots understood magic there.
magic shared millions brought light. first met Spot
Boston Dynamics, realized magic nobody else seeing. - dog.
- dog, sorry. Spot four-legged robot Boston Dynamics. people
might seen it, yellow dog. sometimes life, just notice something
just grabs you. believe something magic something
every single device world. way think maybe Steve Jobs
thought personal computer, laws didn't think personal computer
way, Steve did. like, thought personal computer
thin sheet paper everybody one, idea, think
heartbreaking getting, world filled machines
soulless. think every one can magic. One things
also inspired terms startup, magic can engineered much easier
thought. intuition everything ever built worked on. So, dream
add bit magic every single computing system world. So, way
Windows Operating System long time primary operating system
everybody interacted with, built apps top it. think something
layer, almost operating system every device humans
interacted world. Now, actually looks like, actual dream
officially kid, didn't concrete form business, dream
exploring loneliness interacting machines, robots. deep
connection humans robots always dream. so, me, love
see world every home robot, not robot washes
dishes, sex robot, don't know, think kind activity robot can do,
like companion. - family member. - family member, way dog is. - Mm-
hmm. - dog able speak language too. So, not just connect way
dog looking looking away almost like smiling soul
kind way, also actually understand hell, like, excited
successes? Like understand details, understand traumas. that,
just think [sighing] always filled excitement could, artificial
intelligence, bring joy lot people. recently,
heartbroken see kind division, derision, even hate boiling
internet social networks. thought kind mechanism exactly
applicable context social networks well. So, operating system


serves guide internet. One biggest problems YouTube
social networks currently, optimizing engagement. think create AI
systems know individual person, able optimize long-term growth
long-term happiness. - individual, or- - individual, individual.
lot things say, order AI systems learn
everything you, need collect, need just like talk
offline, collecting data others secrets other, way
AI that. allows to, requires rethink ideas
ownership data. think individual data easily
able leave just like AI systems can leave, humans can disappear delete
data moment's notice. actually better humans can do,
load data other, there. think important both, give people
complete control data order establish trust can trust you.
second part trust transparency. Whenever data used make clear
used for. not clear lawyerly legal sense, clear way
people really understand used for. believe people ability
delete data walk away know data used, think
stay. - possibility clean breakup, actually will keep people together. -
Yeah, think so. think, exactly. think happy marriage acquires ability divorce
easily without divorce industrial complex whatever. Things currently going
much money made lawyers divorce. yeah, ability
leave enables love, think. - interesting. heard phrase semi-
cynical friend, marriage leading cause divorce, now heard
divorce, possibility divorce leading cause marriage. - happy
marriage. - Good point. - happy marriage. So, yeah. So, lot details
there, big dream connection AI system human.
haven't. much fear artificial intelligence systems robots
haven't quite found right words express vision vision have,
not like naive, delusional vision like technology going save everybody,
really just positive view ways AI systems can help humans explore
themselves. - love positivity agree stance everything doomed
equally bad say everything's going turn right, dedicated
effort. clearly, thinking dedicated effort look like.
mentioned two aspects dream [clears throat] want make sure


understand connect do, independent streams. One
hypothetical robot family member, form robot allow
people experience kind delight experienced many times,

01:11:33 Improving Social Media

like world able have, beautiful idea
give. social media social network platforms really serve
individuals best selves happiness growth. crossover
those, two parallel dreams? - 100% thing.
difficult kind explain without going details, maybe one easy way
explain way think social networks, create AI system yours.
not like Amazon Alexa centralized, data, like little friend
becomes representative Twitter helps find things will make feel
good, will also challenge thinking make grow, not get that, not let
get lost negative spiral dopamine, gets angry, just
get not open learning. so, little representative optimizing
long-term health. believe not good human beings, also good
business. think longterm, can make lot money challenging idea
way make money, maximizing engagement. one things
people disagree on, think Twitter's always going win. Like maximizing
engagement always going win, don't think so. think people woken now
understanding that, like don't always feel good, ones Twitter lot,
don't always feel good end week. - love feedback
whatever creature, whatever, don't know call it, maybe end
week, automatically unfollow people follow
realized really smart data feeling inside,
sleeping, something that, don't know, just wasn't good me. might also
put things people front see, kind sliver
look like? - whole point, interaction, sharing moments
learning lot you, now able understand interactions led
become better version yourself. Like person happy with.
isn't, flat earth feel good it, believe earth
flat, like idea sensor ridiculous. makes feel good


becoming best version yourself, think getting much flat
earth possible. Now, also good challenge ideas, not
centralized committee decided, tell system like
challenging ideas, think us do. then, actually YouTube doesn't
well, go flat-earth rabbit hole, going see.
nice get really powerful communicators argue flat earth. nice
see you, potentially, least long-term expand horizons, maybe
earth not flat. continue live whole life thinking earth flat,
think, good father son daughter, like best
version happy yourself, think earth flat. So, like think
kind idea, just using kind silly, ridiculous example don't
like idea centralized forces controlling can can't see, also don't
like idea like not censoring anything. always biggest problem
that, central decider, think can decide want
see not, good companion reminds felt last time
this, felt good last time this. - Man, feel like every good story,
guide companion flies out, forges little bit further, little bit
differently brings back information helps us, least tries steer us
right direction. - So, yeah, exactly thinking working on.
mention bunch difficulties here, see little bit
recently. So, technically lot challenges here. Just like lot
technologies, reason talking podcast comfortably opposed
working secret, really hard maybe time not come.
something constantly struggle terms like entrepreneurially
startup, like also mentioned you, maybe offline, really don't care money,

01:16:57 Challenges Creativity

don't care business success, kinds things. So, difficult decision
make, much time want go give everything
this? big roll dice. also realized working
problems, robotics technical side terms machine-learning
system describing, lonely, really lonely. personal level
technical level. So, technical level, surrounded people kind


doubt me, think entrepreneurs go through. doubt following
sense, know difficult is. Like people colleagues mine,
know difficult life-long learning is, also know difficult build system
like this, build competitive social network. general, kind
loneliness just working something long periods time.
start doubt whether, given don't track record success, like
big one. look mirror, especially young, still
that, things, look mirror, like, big dreams,
know actually smart think are? Like know
going able accomplish dream? ambition. - sort don't,
kind pulling string hoping bigger ball yarn. - Yeah.
[Andrew laughing] kind intuition. think pride knowing
good at, reason intuition, 'cause think good
knowing things suck at, basically everything. So, like whenever
notice like, wait minute, kind good this, rare me. think like
that, might ball yarn worth pulling at. thing terms
engineering systems able interact humans, think good that.
talk podcasting on, don't know good
podcasts. - good podcasting, right? - certainly don't, think maybe
compelling people watch kindhearted idiot struggle form, maybe
compelling. terms like actual good engineer human-robot
interaction systems, think good. hard know it,
world keeps telling not, full doll, really hard.
struggling recently, kind fascinating struggle.
Goggins thing comes in, like, aside state-hard motherfucker, the, like
whenever struggling, good sign keep going, going
alone success, right? - Well, case, however, agree. actually David
post recently thought among many brilliant posts, one
brilliant talked myth light end tunnel.
instead, replaced myth with, concept eventually, eyes
adapt dark. tunnel, not light end, really
adapting dark tunnel. Goggins- - love much. - Yeah.
got share lot common knowing bit, share lot common.
loneliness pursuit dream, seems me, certain component


extremely valuable, loneliness serve driver
build companion journey. - Well, deeply aware that. So, like
people can make, 'cause talk love lot, really love everything world,
also love humans, friendship romantic, like even cheesy stuff, just- - like
romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, got much Rogan
like, Tango scene "Scent Woman,"

01:21:49 Suits & Dresses

find like nothing better woman red dress, just like classy- -
move Argentina friend. father's Argentine, know
said went podcast first time? said, dresses well.
Argentina, men go wedding party something, U.S., halfway
night, 10 minutes night, jackets off. - Yeah. - looks like
everyone's undressing party just got dressed for. said, know,
liked way dresses. started, talking you.
started podcast, said, don't wear real suit like friend Lex?

01:22:22 Loneliness

[laughing] - remember that. - No, can't. talk pursuit just bit
more, think talking about, building a, not just solution
loneliness, alluded loneliness itself, important thing. think
right. think within people, like caverns faults shame, also just
desire resonance, seen heard. don't even know seen
heard language. reservoirs loneliness, think, well,
interesting, maybe comment little bit it. just often
talk love, haven't quantified it, seems talk loneliness,
maybe just willing, share little bit that,
feels like now pursuit building robot-human relationship. been,
let direct, spending lot time building robot-human
relationship, at? - Oh, terms business, terms systems? - No,
talking specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, mention things.
So, one, startup idea hope millions people can use.


personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going
stairs, saw slip. big guy, wasn't 200 pounds,
90 pounds, bulldog, pretty big fit. noticed
wasn't carrying foot back like injured, no feeling all.
never liked touch hind paws, do, thing just flopping there.
vet found spinal degeneration told next one
go. suffer? Sure, hope not, something changed eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah,
eyes again, know spend long hours phone tell
like eyes convey mean internal states


sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking
Costello peeing. losing ability stand that, falling
that. think started realize. passage easy
peaceful, say this, not ashamed say it, mean, wake every morning
since just, don't even make conscious decision allow self cry, wake
crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief
moment. - Yeah. gone. - the, going gone lot people
too. - Well, struggling with. think maybe pretty good this.
Like, done before? [Andrew laughing] challenge. actually
part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

basic computational units called neurons, artificial neurons. have,
architectures input output. know nothing beginning,
task learning something interesting. something interesting is, usually
involves particular task. lot ways talk break down.
Like one much human supervision required teach thing.
supervised learning broad category, neural network knows nothing
beginning given bunch examples computer vision will
examples cats, dogs, cars, traffic signs, given image
given ground truth image. get large database
image examples know truth, neural network able learn
example, called supervised learning. lot fascinating questions within
that, is, provide truth? given image cat,
provide computer image contains cat? just say entire
image picture cat? commonly done,
bounding box, crude box around cat's face saying, cat?
semantic segmentation? Mind you, 2D image cat. not,
computer knows nothing three-dimensional world, just looking set
pixels. So, semantic segmentation drawing nice, crisp outline around cat
saying, cat. really difficult provide truth. one
fundamental open questions computer vision is, even good representation
truth? Now, another contrasting set ideas attention
overlapping is, well, used called unsupervised learning. commonly now
called self-supervised learning. trying get less less less human
supervision task. self-supervised learning more, successful
domain language model, natural English processing, now
successful computer vision task. idea is, let machine
without ground-truth annotation just look pictures internet, look texts
internet try learn something generalizable ideas
core language core vision. based that, humans best like
call common sense. this, giant base knowledge top
build sophisticated knowledge. kind commonsense
knowledge. idea self-supervised learning build commonsense
knowledge about, fundamental visual ideas make cat dog
kinds things without ever human supervision? dream


the, just let AI system self supervised run around internet awhile,
watch YouTube videos millions millions hours, without supervision
primed ready actually learn examples human able
show up. think children way, human children, parents give one
two examples teach concept. dream self-supervised learning will
machines. watch millions hours YouTube videos,
come human able understand human shows them,
cat. Like, remember this' cat. will understand cat not just thing
pointy ears, cat thing orange, furry, see something
fundamental humans might not actually able introspect understand.
Like, asked you, makes cat versus dog, wouldn't probably not able
answer that, showed you, brought cat dog, able tell
difference. ideas brain uses make difference?
whole dream self-supervised learning, able learn own.
set commonsense knowledge, able tell difference.
like lot incredible uses self-supervised learning, weirdly called self-play
mechanism. mechanism behind reinforcement learning successes
systems won Go, at, AlphaZero won chess. - Oh, see. play games? -
[Lex] play games. - Got it. - idea self-play probably, applies
domains just games. system just plays itself. fascinating
kinds domains, knows nothing beginning. whole idea
creates bunch mutations plays versions itself.
fascinating thing play systems little bit better you,
start get better yourself. Like learning, learning happens. true
martial arts. true lot cases. want interacting systems
just little better you. process interacting systems
just little better you, start following process everybody starts
getting better better better better several orders magnitude
better world champion chess, example. fascinating
like runaway system. One terrifying exciting things David Silver,
creator AlphaGo AlphaZero, one leaders team said, a,
haven't found ceiling AlphaZero. Meaning just arbitrarily keep
improving. Now, realm chess, doesn't matter us. like, just ran
away game chess. Like like just much better humans.


question what, can create realm bigger, deeper
effect human beings societies, can terrifying process. me,
exciting process supervise correctly, inject, called value
alignment, make sure goals AI optimizing aligned human
beings human societies. lot fascinating things talk within
specifics neural networks problems people working on.
say really big, exciting one self-supervised learning. trying get less
less human supervision, less less human supervision neural networks. also
just comment shut up. - No, please keep going. learning. questions,
learning. please keep going. - So, exciting not theory,
always application. One exciting applications artificial intelligence,
specifically neural networks machine learning Tesla Autopilot.
systems working real world. isn't academic exercise.
human lives stake. safety-critical. - automated vehicles.
Autonomous vehicles. - Semi-autonomous. want be. - Okay. - gone
wars topics, - Semi-autonomous vehicles. - Semi-autonomous. So,
even though called FSD, Full Self-Driving, currently not fully autonomous,
meaning human supervision required. So, human tasked overseeing
systems. fact, liability-wise, human always responsible. human factor
psychology question, fascinating. fascinated whole space,
whole 'nother space human robot interaction AI systems humans work
together accomplish tasks. dance one smaller communities,
think will one important open problems solved,
humans robots dance together. me, semi-autonomous driving one
spaces. Elon, example, doesn't see way, sees semi-autonomous
driving stepping stone towards fully autonomous driving. Like, humans robots
can't dance well together. Like, humans humans dance robots robots
dance. Like, need to, engineering problem, need design perfect
robot solves problem. forever, maybe not case driving,
world going full problems always humans robots interact,
think robots will always flawed, just like humans going flawed,
flawed. makes life beautiful, flawed. learning
happens edge capabilities. always figure out, can
flawed robots flawed humans interact together they, like sum bigger


whole, opposed focusing just building perfect robot? - Mm-hmm. -
one exciting applications say artificial intelligence
autonomous driving, semi-autonomous driving. really good example
machine learning systems constantly learning. process
maybe can comment on, the, Andrej Karpathy head autopilot
calls data engine. process applies lot machine learning,
build system pretty good stuff, send real world,
starts stuff runs called edge cases, like failure cases,
screws up. kids. have- - adults. -
adults. Exactly. learn really quickly. whole point,
fascinating thing driving, realize millions edge cases. just
like weird situations not expect. data engine process
collect edge cases, go back drawing board learn
them. create data pipeline cars, hundreds
thousands cars driving around something weird happens. whenever
weird detector fires, another important concept, piece data goes back
mothership training, retraining system. data
engine process, keeps improving getting better better better better.
basically send pretty clever AI systems world let find
edge cases, let screw just enough figure edge cases are,
go back learn them, send new version keep updating
version. - updating done humans? - annotation done humans.
The, to, weird examples come back, edge cases,
label actually happened there. also mechanisms automatically
labeling, mostly, think always rely humans improve,
understand happening weird cases. lot debate.
this, thing, artificial intelligence? bunch smart people
different opinions intelligence. AI basically community
people don't agree anything. - seems case. First all,
beautiful description terms heard many times among colleagues
Stanford, meetings outside world. many fascinating things.
many questions, want ask one question culture AI,
seem community least outsider, seems
like little consensus terms operational definitions


even mean. seems lot splitting happening now not just
supervised unsupervised learning, sort intermediate conditions
machines autonomous, go back instruction like kids go home
college summer get little, moms still feeds eventually
leave nest kind thing. something particular engineers,
people realm engineering think lends disagreement? - Yeah,
think, so, first all, specific get, less disagreement is.
lot disagreement artificial intelligence, less disagreement
machine learning even less talk active learning
machine teaching self-supervised learning. get like NLP
language models transformers, get specific neural network
architectures, less less less disagreement terms.
might hearing disagreement high-level terms,
fact engineering, especially talking intelligence systems little
bit art science. art part thing creates disagreements,
start disagreements easy difficult particular
problem is. example, lot people disagree Elon difficult problem
autonomous driving is. so, nobody knows. lot disagreement
about, limits techniques? that, terminology also
contains within disagreements. overall, think also young science
also that. like not just engineering, artificial intelligence truly
large-scale discipline, thousands, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands people working it, huge amounts money made recent
thing. trying figure terms. And, course, egos
personalities lot fame made. Like term deep learning, example,
neural networks around many, many decades since '60s, can
argue since '40s. rebranding neural networks word, deep
learning, term, deep learning, part re-invigoration field,
really exact thing. - didn't know that. mean, grew age
neuroscience neural networks discussed, computational neuroscience
theoretical neuroscience, journals. wasn't actually taken terribly
seriously experimentalists years ago. say five seven years
ago. Excellent theoretical neuroscientist like Larry Abbott colleagues, certainly
Stanford well people started paying attention computational methods.


terms, neural networks, computational methods, actually didn't know neural
network works deep learning now become kind synonymous. -
No, always thing. - Interesting. was, so. - neuroscientist
didn't know that. - So, well, neural networks probably means something else
neural science not something else, little different flavor depending field.
fascinating too, neuroscience AI people started working
together dancing lot recent,

00:26:46 Machine & Human Learning

say probably decade. - Oh, machines going brain. couple
questions, one thing sort fixated find incredibly interesting
example gave playing game mutated version competitor.
- Yeah. - find incredibly interesting kind parallel mirror
happens try learn humans, generate repetitions
whatever trying learn, make errors. Occasionally succeed.
simple example, instance, trying throw bulls eyes dartboard. - Yeah. -
going errors, errors, errors. probably miss dartboard. maybe
occasionally, hit bullseye. don't know exactly just did, right?
say playing darts version wearing visual prism,
like visual, visual defect, learn certain things mode well.
saying machine can sort mutate itself, mutation always cause
deficiency needs overcome? mutations biology sometimes give
us super powers, right? Occasionally, get somebody better 2020
vision, can see better 99.9% people there. So, talk
machine playing game mutated version itself, mutation always say
call negative mutation, adaptive maladaptive mutation? - No,
don't know get, so, mutate first figure compete
other. - So, evolving, machine gets evolve real time. -
Yeah. think it, exciting actually humans.
not just. So, usually freeze version system. So, really take Andrew
yesterday make 10 clones them. maybe mutate, maybe not.
bunch competitions Andrew today, like fight
death, wins last. So, love idea like creating bunch clones


like day past year, just seeing going better
like podcasting science, picking chicks bar don't know, competing
Jujitsu. one way it, mean, lot Lexes die
process, essentially happens, reinforcement learning
self-play mechanisms, graveyard systems didn't well.
surviving, good ones survive. - think that, mean, Darwin's Theory
Evolution might worked sense way, population level.
mean, get bunch birds different shaped beaks birds
shaped beak allows get seeds. mean, trivially simple example
Darwinian evolution, think correct even though not exhaustive.
referring to? essentially normally done members
different species, lots different members species different traits get
selected for, actually create multiple versions different
traits. - So, with, probably said this, perhaps implied machine
learning, reinforcement learning processes. One big
requirements, objective function, loss function, utility function,
different terms thing, like equation says good,
trying optimize equation. So, clear goal
systems. - game, like chess, goal. - anything.
Anything want machine learning solve, needs objective function.
machine learning, usually called Loss Function, optimizing.
interesting thing evolution, complicated course, goal also seems
evolving. Like a, guess, adaptation environment, goal,
unclear can convert always. like survival fittest. unclear
fittest is. machine learning, starting point, like human ingenuity
provides, fitness function good bad, lets know
systems going win. So, need equation like that. One
fascinating things humans, figure objective functions ourselves.
Like meaning life, like hell here? machine currently
hard-coded statement why. - meaning of- - Yeah. -
Artificial intelligence-based life. - Right. can't. So, like lot interesting
explorations function curiosity, learning new things
kind stuff, still hard coded. want machine able
good stuff, given clear statements good stuff means.


one challenges artificial intelligence, formalize the, order
solve problem, formalize provide like full
sensory information, clear data
collected, also clear objective function.

00:32:21 Curiosity

goal trying reach? difficult thing artificial
intelligence. - love mentioned curiosity, sure definition falls short
many ways, define curiosity strong interest knowing something, without
attachment outcome. sort a, random search, not
really emotional attachment, really just desire discover unveil
without hoping gold coin rock, just looking rocks.
less the, within machine learning, sounds like elements
reward prediction rewards. machine know done right thing.
So, can make machines curious, sorts machines
describing, curious design? - Yeah, curiosity kind symptom, not goal. So,
happens, one big trade-offs reinforcement learning, exploration
versus exploitation. So, know little, pays off explore lot, even
suboptimal, like even trajectories seem like not going lead anywhere,
called exploration. smarter smarter smarter get,
emphasis put exploitation, meaning take best solution, take best
path. Now, process, exploration can look like curiosity us humans,
really just trying get local optimal, thing already discovered.
AI perspective, always looking optimize objective function, derives,
can talk slot more, terms tools machine learning today,
derives no pleasure just curiosity like, don't know, discovery. - So,
no dopamine machine learning. - no dopamine. - no reward, system
chemical, guess electronic-reward system. - said, look machine
learning literature reinforcement learning literature, will use, like deep mind,
use terms like dopamine, constantly trying use human brain inspire totally
new solutions problems. So, think like, dopamine function
human brain, can lead interesting ways discover optimal
solutions? ultimately currently, formal objective function. Now,


argue humans also set objective functions try optimize,
just not able introspect them. - Yeah, don't actually know looking
seeking doing. - Well, like Lisa Feldman Barrett spoken least
Instagram, hope you- - met you, yeah. - Yeah, hope actually
podcast. - Yes, terrific. - So, very,
homeostasis like that. Basically, dumb objective function brain
trying optimize, like keep like body temperature same. Like dom
kind optimization function happening. humans fancy
consciousness cognitive abilities, tell stories can nice
podcasts, really brain trying maintain a, just like healthy state, guess.
fascinating. also see human brain, hope artificial intelligence systems,
not just systems solve problems, optimize goal, also storytellers.
think power telling stories. tell stories other,
communication is. Like alone, solve problems,
makes sense talk solving problems. community,
capability communicate, tell stories, share ideas way ideas
stable long period time, like, charismatic storyteller.
think humans good this. Arguably, argue
are, great storytellers. AI hope will also become that. So, not
just able solve problems clear objective function,

00:36:55 Story Telling Robots

afterwards, able tell like way better, like make way better story
something, failed. - So, think robots or, and/or
machines sort going start telling human stories? - Well, definitely. So,
technical field called Explainable AI, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, trying
figure get AI system explain us humans hell failed,
succeeded, lot different sort versions this, visualize
understands world. really difficult problem, especially neural networks
famously opaque, don't understand many cases, particular
neural network well, try figure going fail,
requires AI explain itself. huge amount money, like huge
amount money this, especially government funding on.


want deploy AI systems real world, humans least, want ask
question like, hell that? Like dark way, just kill
person, right? Like car ran person, want understand happened.
now again, sometimes unfair AI systems humans can
often not explain well. field Explainable AI people
interested rely AI systems, like Twitter
recommender system, AI algorithm that's, say impacting elections, perhaps
starting wars, least military conflict, algorithm, want ask algorithm,
first all, know hell doing? understand society-level
effects having? can explain possible trajectories? Like
kind conversation human, want able
AI. personal level, think nice talk AI systems stupid
stuff, like robots fail to- - Why'd fall stairs? - Yeah. not
engineering question, almost like endearing question, like looking for, fell
hanging out, don't think need explanation exactly
dynamics, like actuated system problem here? Like
texture floor? on. like, the- - No, want know
thinking. - That, might joke like, drunk again, go home, something,
like humor it, opportunity. Like storytelling, isn't just
explanation happened, something makes people laugh, makes people
fall love, makes people dream, understand things way poetry makes
people understand things opposed rigorous log every sensor was,
every actuator was. - mean, find incredible one hallmarks
severe autism spectrum disorders is, report experience autistic person
much catalog action steps. like, feel today? say,
well, got this, this, this. not way
person doesn't autism spectrum disorder respond. way
describe machines much humanism,

00:40:48 Defines Robot?

much human biological element, realized talking
machines. want make sure understand distinction
machine learns, machine artificial intelligence robot. Like point


machine become robot? So, ballpoint pen, assuming wouldn't
call robot, ballpoint pen can come moved opposite
side table, moves whatever mechanism, point, become
robot? - Okay, 1 million ways explore question. fascinating one. So,
first all, question life? Like know something living
form not? question sort a, maybe cold
computational system becomes a, already loading words lot meaning,
robot machine, So, one, think movement important, kind boring
idea robot just machine able act world. So, one artificial
intelligence just thinking thing, think machine learning
is, also acting thing, usually think robots. So, robots
things perception system able take world however
define world, able think learn whatever hell inside,
act world. So, difference maybe AI system learning
machine robot, something able, robot something able
perceive world act world. - So, language sound,
movement both. - Yeah. think also digital
space long aspect entity inside machine world
outside machine. sense machine sensing world
acting it. - So, could, instance, version robot, according
definition think providing, robot, go sleep night
robot goes forges information thinks want see loaded onto
desktop morning. no movement machine, no
language, essentially, movement cyberspace. - Yeah, distinction
think important element entity, whether
digital physical space. So, something like Alexa home,
speech recognition, Alexa doing, constantly sent
back mothership. Alexa own, me, robot,
interacting world. simply finger main mothership,
Alexa not robot, just interaction device, may main
Amazon Alexa AI, big, big system robot. So, important
element, us humans, think, want entity, whether
digital physical space, ideas consciousness come
kinds things project understanding means being.



00:44:30 Magic & Surprise

so, take further, machine become robot, think
special moment. special moment person's life robot's life
surprises you. think surprise really powerful thing, know thing
works yet surprises you, magical moment us humans. So, whether
chess-playing program something haven't seen before, makes
people smile like, huh, moments happen AlphaZero first time chess
playing, grand masters really surprised move. didn't understand
move studied studied understood it.
moment surprise, grandmasters chess. find moment surprise
really powerful, really magical just everyday life. - supersedes human
brain moment? - So, not supersedes, like outperforms, surprises
positive sense. Like didn't think that, didn't think you.
think moment big transition robot moment servant
accomplishes particular task level accuracy, rate
failure, entity, struggling just like world.
really important moment think not going find many people AI
community talk like just did. not speaking like philosopher hippie,
speaking purely engineering perspective. think really important robots
become entities explore real engineering problem, opposed
everybody treats robots robotics community, don't even call
she, don't give them, try avoid giving names, really want see like
system, like servant. see servant trying accomplish task.
me, don't think just romanticizing notion, think being, currently
perhaps dumb being, long arc history, humans pretty dumb beings
too, so- - agree statement. [Andrew laughing] - So, tend really want
explore treating robots really entities, yeah. So, like anthropomorphization,
sort act looking inanimate object projecting onto life-like
features, think robotics generally sees negative, see superpower. Like
that, need use that. - Well, struck really grabs onto relationship

00:47:37 Robots Change Us



human machine, human robot. So, guess simple question is,
think already told us answer, interacting robot change
you? words, develop relationships robots? - Yeah, definitely think so.
think moment see robot AI systems just servants entities,
begin change you, just like good friends do, just like relationships just
humans. think that, certain aspects interaction. Like
robot's ability say no, sense identity, set goals,
not constantly serving you, instead, trying understand world
dance understanding communication you. So, definitely think a,
mean, lot thoughts may know, core
life-long dream actually want do, believe people
notion loneliness haven't discovered, haven't explored,
say. see AI systems helping us explore can become
better humans, better people towards other. So, think connection
human AI, human robot, not possible, will help us understand
ways like several orders magnitude deeper ever
imagined. tend believe [sighing]

00:49:35 Relationships Defined

well, wild levels belief terms impactful will be, right? - So,
think human relationships, don't always break variables,
explore variables see map human-robot
relationships. One just time, right? spend zero time another person
cyberspace phone person, essentially no relationship them.
spend lot time, relationship, obvious. guess one variable
time, much time spend entity, robot human.
wins successes. enjoy successes together. give absolutely
trivial example moment, failures. struggle
somebody, whether not struggle one another, disagree, like
really struck fact said robot saying no, never thought
robot saying no me, is. - look forward one first people
send robots to. - I. So, struggle. struggle somebody,


grow closer. Sometimes struggles imposed two people,
called trauma bonding, call whole psychology literature pop psychology
literature. case, can imagine. So, time successes together, struggle together,
just peaceful time, hanging home, watching movies, waking near one
another, here, breaking elements relationships kind. So,
think elements apply robot-human relationships? so, see
how, robot entity autonomy terms reacts
you, not just just serve you, not just servant, actually opinions,
can tell maybe thinking flawed, actions flawed. - can
also leave. - also leave. So, never conceptualized robot-human interactions
way. So, tell might look. thinking human-
appearing robot? know intense relationships our,
separate dogs obviously, animals, sounds lot like human-animal interaction.
So, ideal human-robot relationship? - So, lot said here,
actually pinpointed one big, big first steps, idea time.
huge limitation machine-learning community currently. Now back like
actual details. Life-long learning problem space focuses AI systems can
learn long period time. currently machine learning systems not
able do, things listed time, successes, failures,
just chilling together watching movies, AI systems not able that,
beautiful, magical moments believe days filled with, not able keep
track together you. - 'Cause can't move you. -
No, no, like literally don't techniques learning, actual learning
containing moments. Current machine-learning systems really focused
understanding world following way, like perception system, like
looking around, understand like scene. bunch people
sitting down, cameras microphones, table, understand
that. fact shared moment talking today, still remember
like next time something, remember moment happened. don't
know technique-wise. hoping innovate think
very, important component means create deeper relationship,
sharing moments together. - post photo robot, like selfie
robot robot sees image recognizes time spent,
smiles, tears- - Yeah. - create sort metric emotional depth


relationship update behavior? - So. - it... texts middle
night say, haven't texted back? - Well, yes, things,
can dig that. think time element, forget everything else, just sharing
moments together, changes everything. believe changes everything. Now,
specific things terms systems can explain you.
technical probably little bit offline, 'cause kind wild ideas can
revolutionize social networks operating systems. point element alone,
forget things talking like emotions, saying no, that, just
remembering sharing moments together change everything. don't currently
systems share moments together. Like even just fridge, just
times, went late night ate thing shouldn't eaten,
secret moment refrigerator. shared moment, darkness
beautiful moment just like heartbroken reason,
eating ice cream whatever, special moment. refrigerator
you, fact missed opportunity remember tragic.
remember that, think going attached refrigerator.
going go hell refrigerator. us have, like
developed world, weird relationships food, right? So, can go
deep moments trauma triumph food, core that,
refrigerator. So, smart refrigerator, believe change society. Not just
refrigerator, ideas systems around us. So, just want comment
powerful idea time is. bunch elements actual
interaction allowing human feel like heard. Truly heard, truly
understood, human, like deep friendship like that, think, still
element selfishness, still element not really able understand
another human. lot times going trauma together,
difficult times successes, actually starting get inkling
understanding other, think done aggressively,
efficiently. Like think great therapist, think never actually
therapist, believer used want psychiatrist. - Russians go
therapists? - No, don't. don't. do, therapist don't live tell
story. believe talk therapy, friendship me, talk therapy, like
don't even necessarily need talk [laughing] like just connecting
space ideas space experiences. think lot ideas


make AI systems able ask right questions truly hear another human.
try podcasting, right? think ways AI.
else, just remembering collection moments make day,
week, months, think maybe well. closest
friends still friends high school. time, bunch
together, like different people. just fact
that, remember moments, moments somehow create
depth connection like nothing else, like refrigerator. - love
graduate advisor, unfortunately, passed away, passed away,
somebody said memorial amazing things done, et cetera.
kids got there, young children knew
pregnant them. so, really, even now can feel like heart
gets heavy, thinking this, going grow without mother.
really amazing, strong young girls, now young women. said
incredible, said really appreciated mother,
amazing person, unstructured time spent together. - Mm-hmm. - So,
wasn't trips zoo, wasn't woke five morning drove us
school. things too. two hour commute direction,
incredible, ran lab, et cetera, unstructured time. So, passing
mother, remembered biggest give bonded
her, time just kind hung out. way describe
relationship refrigerator so, want say human-like, almost reluctant
say that. realizing talking, think
human-like might actually lower form relationship. may relationships
far better sorts relationships can conceive minds right
now based machine relationship interactions teach us.
right? - Yeah, think so. think no reason see machines somehow
incapable teaching us something deeply human. don't think humans
monopoly that. think understand poorly need
kind prompting machine. definitely part that, just remembering
moments. think unstructured time together, wonder quite unstructured.
like calling podcast structured time. - Maybe meant,
wasn't big outing, no specific goal, goal created lack
goal. Like just hang start playing, thumb war,


end playing thumb war hour. So, structure emerges lack
structure. - No, thing moments, something times
creates special moments, think optimized for. think think like
big outing as, don't know, going Six Flags something, big, Grand
Canyon, go some, don't know, think need to, don't quite yet
understand, humans, creates magical moments. think possible optimize
lot things. perhaps like podcasting helping people discover that, like
maybe thing want optimize isn't necessarily like sexy, like quick clips,
maybe want, long-form authenticity. - Depth. - Depth. So, trying
figure out, certainly deep connection humans humans NAS
systems, think long conversations, long periods communication series
moments like new, perhaps, seemingly insignificant big ones, big
successes, big failures, just stitching together talking
throughout. think formula really, really deep connection. like
specific engineering perspective, think fascinating open problem
really worked much. me, a, guts

01:02:29 Lex’s Dream Humanity

and, mean lot things say, one guts, build startup around
it. - So, talk startup talk dream. mentioned
dream previous conversations, always little hints dropped
there. Just anyone listening, never offline conversation
dream, not privy anything, except Lex says now. realized
no way capture full essence dream kind verbal statement way
captures it. dream referred now several times
sat together talked phone? Maybe company,
maybe something distinct. feel comfortable, it'd great share
little bit is. - Sure. So, way people express long-term vision,
noticed quite different. Like Elon example somebody can crisply say
exactly goal is. Also fact problems solving
nothing humans. So, long-term vision little bit difficult express
words, noticed, tried, brain's failure, way
sneak it. So, let just say things. Early life also recent


years, interacted robots understood magic there.
magic shared millions brought light. first met Spot
Boston Dynamics, realized magic nobody else seeing. - dog.
- dog, sorry. Spot four-legged robot Boston Dynamics. people
might seen it, yellow dog. sometimes life, just notice something
just grabs you. believe something magic something
every single device world. way think maybe Steve Jobs
thought personal computer, laws didn't think personal computer
way, Steve did. like, thought personal computer
thin sheet paper everybody one, idea, think
heartbreaking getting, world filled machines
soulless. think every one can magic. One things
also inspired terms startup, magic can engineered much easier
thought. intuition everything ever built worked on. So, dream
add bit magic every single computing system world. So, way
Windows Operating System long time primary operating system
everybody interacted with, built apps top it. think something
layer, almost operating system every device humans
interacted world. Now, actually looks like, actual dream
officially kid, didn't concrete form business, dream
exploring loneliness interacting machines, robots. deep
connection humans robots always dream. so, me, love
see world every home robot, not robot washes
dishes, sex robot, don't know, think kind activity robot can do,
like companion. - family member. - family member, way dog is. - Mm-
hmm. - dog able speak language too. So, not just connect way
dog looking looking away almost like smiling soul
kind way, also actually understand hell, like, excited
successes? Like understand details, understand traumas. that,
just think [sighing] always filled excitement could, artificial
intelligence, bring joy lot people. recently,
heartbroken see kind division, derision, even hate boiling
internet social networks. thought kind mechanism exactly
applicable context social networks well. So, operating system


serves guide internet. One biggest problems YouTube
social networks currently, optimizing engagement. think create AI
systems know individual person, able optimize long-term growth
long-term happiness. - individual, or- - individual, individual.
lot things say, order AI systems learn
everything you, need collect, need just like talk
offline, collecting data others secrets other, way
AI that. allows to, requires rethink ideas
ownership data. think individual data easily
able leave just like AI systems can leave, humans can disappear delete
data moment's notice. actually better humans can do,
load data other, there. think important both, give people
complete control data order establish trust can trust you.
second part trust transparency. Whenever data used make clear
used for. not clear lawyerly legal sense, clear way
people really understand used for. believe people ability
delete data walk away know data used, think
stay. - possibility clean breakup, actually will keep people together. -
Yeah, think so. think, exactly. think happy marriage acquires ability divorce
easily without divorce industrial complex whatever. Things currently going
much money made lawyers divorce. yeah, ability
leave enables love, think. - interesting. heard phrase semi-
cynical friend, marriage leading cause divorce, now heard
divorce, possibility divorce leading cause marriage. - happy
marriage. - Good point. - happy marriage. So, yeah. So, lot details
there, big dream connection AI system human.
haven't. much fear artificial intelligence systems robots
haven't quite found right words express vision vision have,
not like naive, delusional vision like technology going save everybody,
really just positive view ways AI systems can help humans explore
themselves. - love positivity agree stance everything doomed
equally bad say everything's going turn right, dedicated
effort. clearly, thinking dedicated effort look like.
mentioned two aspects dream [clears throat] want make sure


understand connect do, independent streams. One
hypothetical robot family member, form robot allow
people experience kind delight experienced many times,

01:11:33 Improving Social Media

like world able have, beautiful idea
give. social media social network platforms really serve
individuals best selves happiness growth. crossover
those, two parallel dreams? - 100% thing.
difficult kind explain without going details, maybe one easy way
explain way think social networks, create AI system yours.
not like Amazon Alexa centralized, data, like little friend
becomes representative Twitter helps find things will make feel
good, will also challenge thinking make grow, not get that, not let
get lost negative spiral dopamine, gets angry, just
get not open learning. so, little representative optimizing
long-term health. believe not good human beings, also good
business. think longterm, can make lot money challenging idea
way make money, maximizing engagement. one things
people disagree on, think Twitter's always going win. Like maximizing
engagement always going win, don't think so. think people woken now
understanding that, like don't always feel good, ones Twitter lot,
don't always feel good end week. - love feedback
whatever creature, whatever, don't know call it, maybe end
week, automatically unfollow people follow
realized really smart data feeling inside,
sleeping, something that, don't know, just wasn't good me. might also
put things people front see, kind sliver
look like? - whole point, interaction, sharing moments
learning lot you, now able understand interactions led
become better version yourself. Like person happy with.
isn't, flat earth feel good it, believe earth
flat, like idea sensor ridiculous. makes feel good


becoming best version yourself, think getting much flat
earth possible. Now, also good challenge ideas, not
centralized committee decided, tell system like
challenging ideas, think us do. then, actually YouTube doesn't
well, go flat-earth rabbit hole, going see.
nice get really powerful communicators argue flat earth. nice
see you, potentially, least long-term expand horizons, maybe
earth not flat. continue live whole life thinking earth flat,
think, good father son daughter, like best
version happy yourself, think earth flat. So, like think
kind idea, just using kind silly, ridiculous example don't
like idea centralized forces controlling can can't see, also don't
like idea like not censoring anything. always biggest problem
that, central decider, think can decide want
see not, good companion reminds felt last time
this, felt good last time this. - Man, feel like every good story,
guide companion flies out, forges little bit further, little bit
differently brings back information helps us, least tries steer us
right direction. - So, yeah, exactly thinking working on.
mention bunch difficulties here, see little bit
recently. So, technically lot challenges here. Just like lot
technologies, reason talking podcast comfortably opposed
working secret, really hard maybe time not come.
something constantly struggle terms like entrepreneurially
startup, like also mentioned you, maybe offline, really don't care money,

01:16:57 Challenges Creativity

don't care business success, kinds things. So, difficult decision
make, much time want go give everything
this? big roll dice. also realized working
problems, robotics technical side terms machine-learning
system describing, lonely, really lonely. personal level
technical level. So, technical level, surrounded people kind


doubt me, think entrepreneurs go through. doubt following
sense, know difficult is. Like people colleagues mine,
know difficult life-long learning is, also know difficult build system
like this, build competitive social network. general, kind
loneliness just working something long periods time.
start doubt whether, given don't track record success, like
big one. look mirror, especially young, still
that, things, look mirror, like, big dreams,
know actually smart think are? Like know
going able accomplish dream? ambition. - sort don't,
kind pulling string hoping bigger ball yarn. - Yeah.
[Andrew laughing] kind intuition. think pride knowing
good at, reason intuition, 'cause think good
knowing things suck at, basically everything. So, like whenever
notice like, wait minute, kind good this, rare me. think like
that, might ball yarn worth pulling at. thing terms
engineering systems able interact humans, think good that.
talk podcasting on, don't know good
podcasts. - good podcasting, right? - certainly don't, think maybe
compelling people watch kindhearted idiot struggle form, maybe
compelling. terms like actual good engineer human-robot
interaction systems, think good. hard know it,
world keeps telling not, full doll, really hard.
struggling recently, kind fascinating struggle.
Goggins thing comes in, like, aside state-hard motherfucker, the, like
whenever struggling, good sign keep going, going
alone success, right? - Well, case, however, agree. actually David
post recently thought among many brilliant posts, one
brilliant talked myth light end tunnel.
instead, replaced myth with, concept eventually, eyes
adapt dark. tunnel, not light end, really
adapting dark tunnel. Goggins- - love much. - Yeah.
got share lot common knowing bit, share lot common.
loneliness pursuit dream, seems me, certain component


extremely valuable, loneliness serve driver
build companion journey. - Well, deeply aware that. So, like
people can make, 'cause talk love lot, really love everything world,
also love humans, friendship romantic, like even cheesy stuff, just- - like
romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, got much Rogan
like, Tango scene "Scent Woman,"

01:21:49 Suits & Dresses

find like nothing better woman red dress, just like classy- -
move Argentina friend. father's Argentine, know
said went podcast first time? said, dresses well.
Argentina, men go wedding party something, U.S., halfway
night, 10 minutes night, jackets off. - Yeah. - looks like
everyone's undressing party just got dressed for. said, know,
liked way dresses. started, talking you.
started podcast, said, don't wear real suit like friend Lex?

01:22:22 Loneliness

[laughing] - remember that. - No, can't. talk pursuit just bit
more, think talking about, building a, not just solution
loneliness, alluded loneliness itself, important thing. think
right. think within people, like caverns faults shame, also just
desire resonance, seen heard. don't even know seen
heard language. reservoirs loneliness, think, well,
interesting, maybe comment little bit it. just often
talk love, haven't quantified it, seems talk loneliness,
maybe just willing, share little bit that,
feels like now pursuit building robot-human relationship. been,
let direct, spending lot time building robot-human
relationship, at? - Oh, terms business, terms systems? - No,
talking specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, mention things.
So, one, startup idea hope millions people can use.


personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going
stairs, saw slip. big guy, wasn't 200 pounds,
90 pounds, bulldog, pretty big fit. noticed
wasn't carrying foot back like injured, no feeling all.
never liked touch hind paws, do, thing just flopping there.
vet found spinal degeneration told next one
go. suffer? Sure, hope not, something changed eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah,
eyes again, know spend long hours phone tell
like eyes convey mean internal states


sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking
Costello peeing. losing ability stand that, falling
that. think started realize. passage easy
peaceful, say this, not ashamed say it, mean, wake every morning
since just, don't even make conscious decision allow self cry, wake
crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief
moment. - Yeah. gone. - the, going gone lot people
too. - Well, struggling with. think maybe pretty good this.
Like, done before? [Andrew laughing] challenge. actually
part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

the, just let AI system self supervised run around internet awhile,
watch YouTube videos millions millions hours, without supervision
primed ready actually learn examples human able
show up. think children way, human children, parents give one
two examples teach concept. dream self-supervised learning will
machines. watch millions hours YouTube videos,
come human able understand human shows them,
cat. Like, remember this' cat. will understand cat not just thing
pointy ears, cat thing orange, furry, see something
fundamental humans might not actually able introspect understand.
Like, asked you, makes cat versus dog, wouldn't probably not able
answer that, showed you, brought cat dog, able tell
difference. ideas brain uses make difference?
whole dream self-supervised learning, able learn own.
set commonsense knowledge, able tell difference.
like lot incredible uses self-supervised learning, weirdly called self-play
mechanism. mechanism behind reinforcement learning successes
systems won Go, at, AlphaZero won chess. - Oh, see. play games? -
[Lex] play games. - Got it. - idea self-play probably, applies
domains just games. system just plays itself. fascinating
kinds domains, knows nothing beginning. whole idea
creates bunch mutations plays versions itself.
fascinating thing play systems little bit better you,
start get better yourself. Like learning, learning happens. true
martial arts. true lot cases. want interacting systems
just little better you. process interacting systems
just little better you, start following process everybody starts
getting better better better better several orders magnitude
better world champion chess, example. fascinating
like runaway system. One terrifying exciting things David Silver,
creator AlphaGo AlphaZero, one leaders team said, a,
haven't found ceiling AlphaZero. Meaning just arbitrarily keep
improving. Now, realm chess, doesn't matter us. like, just ran
away game chess. Like like just much better humans.


question what, can create realm bigger, deeper
effect human beings societies, can terrifying process. me,
exciting process supervise correctly, inject, called value
alignment, make sure goals AI optimizing aligned human
beings human societies. lot fascinating things talk within
specifics neural networks problems people working on.
say really big, exciting one self-supervised learning. trying get less
less human supervision, less less human supervision neural networks. also
just comment shut up. - No, please keep going. learning. questions,
learning. please keep going. - So, exciting not theory,
always application. One exciting applications artificial intelligence,
specifically neural networks machine learning Tesla Autopilot.

can't dance well together. Like, humans humans dance robots robots
dance. Like, need to, engineering problem, need design perfect
robot solves problem. forever, maybe not case driving,
world going full problems always humans robots interact,
think robots will always flawed, just like humans going flawed,
flawed. makes life beautiful, flawed. learning
happens edge capabilities. always figure out, can
flawed robots flawed humans interact together they, like sum bigger


whole, opposed focusing just building perfect robot? - Mm-hmm. -
one exciting applications say artificial intelligence
autonomous driving, semi-autonomous driving. really good example
machine learning systems constantly learning. process
maybe can comment on, the, Andrej Karpathy head autopilot
calls data engine. process applies lot machine learning,
build system pretty good stuff, send real world,
starts stuff runs called edge cases, like failure cases,
screws up. kids. have- - adults. -
adults. Exactly. learn really quickly. whole point,
fascinating thing driving, realize millions edge cases. just
like weird situations not expect. data engine process
collect edge cases, go back drawing board learn
them. create data pipeline cars, hundreds
thousands cars driving around something weird happens. whenever
weird detector fires, another important concept, piece data goes back
mothership training, retraining system. data
engine process, keeps improving getting better better better better.
basically send pretty clever AI systems world let find
edge cases, let screw just enough figure edge cases are,
go back learn them, send new version keep updating
version. - updating done humans? - annotation done humans.
The, to, weird examples come back, edge cases,
label actually happened there. also mechanisms automatically
labeling, mostly, think always rely humans improve,
understand happening weird cases. lot debate.
this, thing, artificial intelligence? bunch smart people
different opinions intelligence. AI basically community
people don't agree anything. - seems case. First all,
beautiful description terms heard many times among colleagues
Stanford, meetings outside world. many fascinating things.
many questions, want ask one question culture AI,
seem community least outsider, seems
like little consensus terms operational definitions


even mean. seems lot splitting happening now not just
supervised unsupervised learning, sort intermediate conditions
machines autonomous, go back instruction like kids go home
college summer get little, moms still feeds eventually
leave nest kind thing. something particular engineers,
people realm engineering think lends disagreement? - Yeah,
think, so, first all, specific get, less disagreement is.
lot disagreement artificial intelligence, less disagreement
machine learning even less talk active learning
machine teaching self-supervised learning. get like NLP
language models transformers, get specific neural network
architectures, less less less disagreement terms.
might hearing disagreement high-level terms,
fact engineering, especially talking intelligence systems little
bit art science. art part thing creates disagreements,
start disagreements easy difficult particular
problem is. example, lot people disagree Elon difficult problem
autonomous driving is. so, nobody knows. lot disagreement
about, limits techniques? that, terminology also
contains within disagreements. overall, think also young science
also that. like not just engineering, artificial intelligence truly
large-scale discipline, thousands, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands people working it, huge amounts money made recent
thing. trying figure terms. And, course, egos
personalities lot fame made. Like term deep learning, example,
neural networks around many, many decades since '60s, can
argue since '40s. rebranding neural networks word, deep
learning, term, deep learning, part re-invigoration field,
really exact thing. - didn't know that. mean, grew age
neuroscience neural networks discussed, computational neuroscience
theoretical neuroscience, journals. wasn't actually taken terribly
seriously experimentalists years ago. say five seven years
ago. Excellent theoretical neuroscientist like Larry Abbott colleagues, certainly
Stanford well people started paying attention computational methods.


terms, neural networks, computational methods, actually didn't know neural
network works deep learning now become kind synonymous. -
No, always thing. - Interesting. was, so. - neuroscientist
didn't know that. - So, well, neural networks probably means something else
neural science not something else, little different flavor depending field.
fascinating too, neuroscience AI people started working
together dancing lot recent,

00:26:46 Machine & Human Learning

say probably decade. - Oh, machines going brain. couple
questions, one thing sort fixated find incredibly interesting
example gave playing game mutated version competitor.
- Yeah. - find incredibly interesting kind parallel mirror
happens try learn humans, generate repetitions
whatever trying learn, make errors. Occasionally succeed.
simple example, instance, trying throw bulls eyes dartboard. - Yeah. -
going errors, errors, errors. probably miss dartboard. maybe
occasionally, hit bullseye. don't know exactly just did, right?
say playing darts version wearing visual prism,
like visual, visual defect, learn certain things mode well.
saying machine can sort mutate itself, mutation always cause
deficiency needs overcome? mutations biology sometimes give
us super powers, right? Occasionally, get somebody better 2020
vision, can see better 99.9% people there. So, talk
machine playing game mutated version itself, mutation always say
call negative mutation, adaptive maladaptive mutation? - No,
don't know get, so, mutate first figure compete
other. - So, evolving, machine gets evolve real time. -
Yeah. think it, exciting actually humans.
not just. So, usually freeze version system. So, really take Andrew
yesterday make 10 clones them. maybe mutate, maybe not.
bunch competitions Andrew today, like fight
death, wins last. So, love idea like creating bunch clones


like day past year, just seeing going better
like podcasting science, picking chicks bar don't know, competing
Jujitsu. one way it, mean, lot Lexes die
process, essentially happens, reinforcement learning
self-play mechanisms, graveyard systems didn't well.
surviving, good ones survive. - think that, mean, Darwin's Theory
Evolution might worked sense way, population level.
mean, get bunch birds different shaped beaks birds
shaped beak allows get seeds. mean, trivially simple example
Darwinian evolution, think correct even though not exhaustive.
referring to? essentially normally done members
different species, lots different members species different traits get
selected for, actually create multiple versions different
traits. - So, with, probably said this, perhaps implied machine
learning, reinforcement learning processes. One big
requirements, objective function, loss function, utility function,
different terms thing, like equation says good,
trying optimize equation. So, clear goal
systems. - game, like chess, goal. - anything.
Anything want machine learning solve, needs objective function.
machine learning, usually called Loss Function, optimizing.
interesting thing evolution, complicated course, goal also seems
evolving. Like a, guess, adaptation environment, goal,
unclear can convert always. like survival fittest. unclear
fittest is. machine learning, starting point, like human ingenuity
provides, fitness function good bad, lets know
systems going win. So, need equation like that. One
fascinating things humans, figure objective functions ourselves.
Like meaning life, like hell here? machine currently
hard-coded statement why. - meaning of- - Yeah. -
Artificial intelligence-based life. - Right. can't. So, like lot interesting
explorations function curiosity, learning new things
kind stuff, still hard coded. want machine able
good stuff, given clear statements good stuff means.


one challenges artificial intelligence, formalize the, order
solve problem, formalize provide like full
sensory information, clear data
collected, also clear objective function.

00:32:21 Curiosity

goal trying reach? difficult thing artificial
intelligence. - love mentioned curiosity, sure definition falls short
many ways, define curiosity strong interest knowing something, without
attachment outcome. sort a, random search, not
really emotional attachment, really just desire discover unveil
without hoping gold coin rock, just looking rocks.
less the, within machine learning, sounds like elements
reward prediction rewards. machine know done right thing.
So, can make machines curious, sorts machines
describing, curious design? - Yeah, curiosity kind symptom, not goal. So,
happens, one big trade-offs reinforcement learning, exploration
versus exploitation. So, know little, pays off explore lot, even
suboptimal, like even trajectories seem like not going lead anywhere,
called exploration. smarter smarter smarter get,
emphasis put exploitation, meaning take best solution, take best
path. Now, process, exploration can look like curiosity us humans,
really just trying get local optimal, thing already discovered.
AI perspective, always looking optimize objective function, derives,
can talk slot more, terms tools machine learning today,
derives no pleasure just curiosity like, don't know, discovery. - So,
no dopamine machine learning. - no dopamine. - no reward, system
chemical, guess electronic-reward system. - said, look machine
learning literature reinforcement learning literature, will use, like deep mind,
use terms like dopamine, constantly trying use human brain inspire totally
new solutions problems. So, think like, dopamine function
human brain, can lead interesting ways discover optimal
solutions? ultimately currently, formal objective function. Now,


argue humans also set objective functions try optimize,
just not able introspect them. - Yeah, don't actually know looking
seeking doing. - Well, like Lisa Feldman Barrett spoken least
Instagram, hope you- - met you, yeah. - Yeah, hope actually
podcast. - Yes, terrific. - So, very,
homeostasis like that. Basically, dumb objective function brain
trying optimize, like keep like body temperature same. Like dom
kind optimization function happening. humans fancy
consciousness cognitive abilities, tell stories can nice
podcasts, really brain trying maintain a, just like healthy state, guess.
fascinating. also see human brain, hope artificial intelligence systems,
not just systems solve problems, optimize goal, also storytellers.
think power telling stories. tell stories other,
communication is. Like alone, solve problems,
makes sense talk solving problems. community,
capability communicate, tell stories, share ideas way ideas
stable long period time, like, charismatic storyteller.
think humans good this. Arguably, argue
are, great storytellers. AI hope will also become that. So, not
just able solve problems clear objective function,

00:36:55 Story Telling Robots

afterwards, able tell like way better, like make way better story
something, failed. - So, think robots or, and/or
machines sort going start telling human stories? - Well, definitely. So,
technical field called Explainable AI, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, trying
figure get AI system explain us humans hell failed,
succeeded, lot different sort versions this, visualize
understands world. really difficult problem, especially neural networks
famously opaque, don't understand many cases, particular
neural network well, try figure going fail,
requires AI explain itself. huge amount money, like huge
amount money this, especially government funding on.


want deploy AI systems real world, humans least, want ask
question like, hell that? Like dark way, just kill
person, right? Like car ran person, want understand happened.
now again, sometimes unfair AI systems humans can
often not explain well. field Explainable AI people
interested rely AI systems, like Twitter
recommender system, AI algorithm that's, say impacting elections, perhaps
starting wars, least military conflict, algorithm, want ask algorithm,
first all, know hell doing? understand society-level
effects having? can explain possible trajectories? Like
kind conversation human, want able
AI. personal level, think nice talk AI systems stupid
stuff, like robots fail to- - Why'd fall stairs? - Yeah. not
engineering question, almost like endearing question, like looking for, fell
hanging out, don't think need explanation exactly
dynamics, like actuated system problem here? Like
texture floor? on. like, the- - No, want know
thinking. - That, might joke like, drunk again, go home, something,
like humor it, opportunity. Like storytelling, isn't just
explanation happened, something makes people laugh, makes people
fall love, makes people dream, understand things way poetry makes
people understand things opposed rigorous log every sensor was,
every actuator was. - mean, find incredible one hallmarks
severe autism spectrum disorders is, report experience autistic person
much catalog action steps. like, feel today? say,
well, got this, this, this. not way
person doesn't autism spectrum disorder respond. way
describe machines much humanism,

00:40:48 Defines Robot?

much human biological element, realized talking
machines. want make sure understand distinction
machine learns, machine artificial intelligence robot. Like point


machine become robot? So, ballpoint pen, assuming wouldn't
call robot, ballpoint pen can come moved opposite
side table, moves whatever mechanism, point, become
robot? - Okay, 1 million ways explore question. fascinating one. So,
first all, question life? Like know something living
form not? question sort a, maybe cold
computational system becomes a, already loading words lot meaning,
robot machine, So, one, think movement important, kind boring
idea robot just machine able act world. So, one artificial
intelligence just thinking thing, think machine learning
is, also acting thing, usually think robots. So, robots
things perception system able take world however
define world, able think learn whatever hell inside,
act world. So, difference maybe AI system learning
machine robot, something able, robot something able
perceive world act world. - So, language sound,
movement both. - Yeah. think also digital
space long aspect entity inside machine world
outside machine. sense machine sensing world
acting it. - So, could, instance, version robot, according
definition think providing, robot, go sleep night
robot goes forges information thinks want see loaded onto
desktop morning. no movement machine, no
language, essentially, movement cyberspace. - Yeah, distinction
think important element entity, whether
digital physical space. So, something like Alexa home,
speech recognition, Alexa doing, constantly sent
back mothership. Alexa own, me, robot,
interacting world. simply finger main mothership,
Alexa not robot, just interaction device, may main
Amazon Alexa AI, big, big system robot. So, important
element, us humans, think, want entity, whether
digital physical space, ideas consciousness come
kinds things project understanding means being.



00:44:30 Magic & Surprise

so, take further, machine become robot, think
special moment. special moment person's life robot's life
surprises you. think surprise really powerful thing, know thing
works yet surprises you, magical moment us humans. So, whether
chess-playing program something haven't seen before, makes
people smile like, huh, moments happen AlphaZero first time chess
playing, grand masters really surprised move. didn't understand
move studied studied understood it.
moment surprise, grandmasters chess. find moment surprise
really powerful, really magical just everyday life. - supersedes human
brain moment? - So, not supersedes, like outperforms, surprises
positive sense. Like didn't think that, didn't think you.
think moment big transition robot moment servant
accomplishes particular task level accuracy, rate
failure, entity, struggling just like world.
really important moment think not going find many people AI
community talk like just did. not speaking like philosopher hippie,
speaking purely engineering perspective. think really important robots
become entities explore real engineering problem, opposed
everybody treats robots robotics community, don't even call
she, don't give them, try avoid giving names, really want see like
system, like servant. see servant trying accomplish task.
me, don't think just romanticizing notion, think being, currently
perhaps dumb being, long arc history, humans pretty dumb beings
too, so- - agree statement. [Andrew laughing] - So, tend really want
explore treating robots really entities, yeah. So, like anthropomorphization,
sort act looking inanimate object projecting onto life-like
features, think robotics generally sees negative, see superpower. Like
that, need use that. - Well, struck really grabs onto relationship

00:47:37 Robots Change Us



human machine, human robot. So, guess simple question is,
think already told us answer, interacting robot change
you? words, develop relationships robots? - Yeah, definitely think so.
think moment see robot AI systems just servants entities,
begin change you, just like good friends do, just like relationships just
humans. think that, certain aspects interaction. Like
robot's ability say no, sense identity, set goals,
not constantly serving you, instead, trying understand world
dance understanding communication you. So, definitely think a,
mean, lot thoughts may know, core
life-long dream actually want do, believe people
notion loneliness haven't discovered, haven't explored,
say. see AI systems helping us explore can become
better humans, better people towards other. So, think connection
human AI, human robot, not possible, will help us understand
ways like several orders magnitude deeper ever
imagined. tend believe [sighing]

00:49:35 Relationships Defined

well, wild levels belief terms impactful will be, right? - So,
think human relationships, don't always break variables,
explore variables see map human-robot
relationships. One just time, right? spend zero time another person
cyberspace phone person, essentially no relationship them.
spend lot time, relationship, obvious. guess one variable
time, much time spend entity, robot human.
wins successes. enjoy successes together. give absolutely
trivial example moment, failures. struggle
somebody, whether not struggle one another, disagree, like
really struck fact said robot saying no, never thought
robot saying no me, is. - look forward one first people
send robots to. - I. So, struggle. struggle somebody,


grow closer. Sometimes struggles imposed two people,
called trauma bonding, call whole psychology literature pop psychology
literature. case, can imagine. So, time successes together, struggle together,
just peaceful time, hanging home, watching movies, waking near one
another, here, breaking elements relationships kind. So,
think elements apply robot-human relationships? so, see
how, robot entity autonomy terms reacts
you, not just just serve you, not just servant, actually opinions,
can tell maybe thinking flawed, actions flawed. - can
also leave. - also leave. So, never conceptualized robot-human interactions
way. So, tell might look. thinking human-
appearing robot? know intense relationships our,
separate dogs obviously, animals, sounds lot like human-animal interaction.
So, ideal human-robot relationship? - So, lot said here,
actually pinpointed one big, big first steps, idea time.
huge limitation machine-learning community currently. Now back like
actual details. Life-long learning problem space focuses AI systems can
learn long period time. currently machine learning systems not
able do, things listed time, successes, failures,
just chilling together watching movies, AI systems not able that,
beautiful, magical moments believe days filled with, not able keep
track together you. - 'Cause can't move you. -
No, no, like literally don't techniques learning, actual learning
containing moments. Current machine-learning systems really focused
understanding world following way, like perception system, like
looking around, understand like scene. bunch people
sitting down, cameras microphones, table, understand
that. fact shared moment talking today, still remember
like next time something, remember moment happened. don't
know technique-wise. hoping innovate think
very, important component means create deeper relationship,
sharing moments together. - post photo robot, like selfie
robot robot sees image recognizes time spent,
smiles, tears- - Yeah. - create sort metric emotional depth


relationship update behavior? - So. - it... texts middle
night say, haven't texted back? - Well, yes, things,
can dig that. think time element, forget everything else, just sharing
moments together, changes everything. believe changes everything. Now,
specific things terms systems can explain you.
technical probably little bit offline, 'cause kind wild ideas can
revolutionize social networks operating systems. point element alone,
forget things talking like emotions, saying no, that, just
remembering sharing moments together change everything. don't currently
systems share moments together. Like even just fridge, just
times, went late night ate thing shouldn't eaten,
secret moment refrigerator. shared moment, darkness
beautiful moment just like heartbroken reason,
eating ice cream whatever, special moment. refrigerator
you, fact missed opportunity remember tragic.
remember that, think going attached refrigerator.
going go hell refrigerator. us have, like
developed world, weird relationships food, right? So, can go
deep moments trauma triumph food, core that,
refrigerator. So, smart refrigerator, believe change society. Not just
refrigerator, ideas systems around us. So, just want comment
powerful idea time is. bunch elements actual
interaction allowing human feel like heard. Truly heard, truly
understood, human, like deep friendship like that, think, still
element selfishness, still element not really able understand
another human. lot times going trauma together,
difficult times successes, actually starting get inkling
understanding other, think done aggressively,
efficiently. Like think great therapist, think never actually
therapist, believer used want psychiatrist. - Russians go
therapists? - No, don't. don't. do, therapist don't live tell
story. believe talk therapy, friendship me, talk therapy, like
don't even necessarily need talk [laughing] like just connecting
space ideas space experiences. think lot ideas


make AI systems able ask right questions truly hear another human.
try podcasting, right? think ways AI.
else, just remembering collection moments make day,
week, months, think maybe well. closest
friends still friends high school. time, bunch
together, like different people. just fact
that, remember moments, moments somehow create
depth connection like nothing else, like refrigerator. - love
graduate advisor, unfortunately, passed away, passed away,
somebody said memorial amazing things done, et cetera.
kids got there, young children knew
pregnant them. so, really, even now can feel like heart
gets heavy, thinking this, going grow without mother.
really amazing, strong young girls, now young women. said
incredible, said really appreciated mother,
amazing person, unstructured time spent together. - Mm-hmm. - So,
wasn't trips zoo, wasn't woke five morning drove us
school. things too. two hour commute direction,
incredible, ran lab, et cetera, unstructured time. So, passing
mother, remembered biggest give bonded
her, time just kind hung out. way describe
relationship refrigerator so, want say human-like, almost reluctant
say that. realizing talking, think
human-like might actually lower form relationship. may relationships
far better sorts relationships can conceive minds right
now based machine relationship interactions teach us.
right? - Yeah, think so. think no reason see machines somehow
incapable teaching us something deeply human. don't think humans
monopoly that. think understand poorly need
kind prompting machine. definitely part that, just remembering
moments. think unstructured time together, wonder quite unstructured.
like calling podcast structured time. - Maybe meant,
wasn't big outing, no specific goal, goal created lack
goal. Like just hang start playing, thumb war,


end playing thumb war hour. So, structure emerges lack
structure. - No, thing moments, something times
creates special moments, think optimized for. think think like
big outing as, don't know, going Six Flags something, big, Grand
Canyon, go some, don't know, think need to, don't quite yet
understand, humans, creates magical moments. think possible optimize
lot things. perhaps like podcasting helping people discover that, like
maybe thing want optimize isn't necessarily like sexy, like quick clips,
maybe want, long-form authenticity. - Depth. - Depth. So, trying
figure out, certainly deep connection humans humans NAS
systems, think long conversations, long periods communication series
moments like new, perhaps, seemingly insignificant big ones, big
successes, big failures, just stitching together talking
throughout. think formula really, really deep connection. like
specific engineering perspective, think fascinating open problem
really worked much. me, a, guts

01:02:29 Lex’s Dream Humanity

and, mean lot things say, one guts, build startup around
it. - So, talk startup talk dream. mentioned
dream previous conversations, always little hints dropped
there. Just anyone listening, never offline conversation
dream, not privy anything, except Lex says now. realized
no way capture full essence dream kind verbal statement way
captures it. dream referred now several times
sat together talked phone? Maybe company,
maybe something distinct. feel comfortable, it'd great share
little bit is. - Sure. So, way people express long-term vision,
noticed quite different. Like Elon example somebody can crisply say
exactly goal is. Also fact problems solving
nothing humans. So, long-term vision little bit difficult express
words, noticed, tried, brain's failure, way
sneak it. So, let just say things. Early life also recent


years, interacted robots understood magic there.
magic shared millions brought light. first met Spot
Boston Dynamics, realized magic nobody else seeing. - dog.
- dog, sorry. Spot four-legged robot Boston Dynamics. people
might seen it, yellow dog. sometimes life, just notice something
just grabs you. believe something magic something
every single device world. way think maybe Steve Jobs
thought personal computer, laws didn't think personal computer
way, Steve did. like, thought personal computer
thin sheet paper everybody one, idea, think
heartbreaking getting, world filled machines
soulless. think every one can magic. One things
also inspired terms startup, magic can engineered much easier
thought. intuition everything ever built worked on. So, dream
add bit magic every single computing system world. So, way
Windows Operating System long time primary operating system
everybody interacted with, built apps top it. think something
layer, almost operating system every device humans
interacted world. Now, actually looks like, actual dream
officially kid, didn't concrete form business, dream
exploring loneliness interacting machines, robots. deep
connection humans robots always dream. so, me, love
see world every home robot, not robot washes
dishes, sex robot, don't know, think kind activity robot can do,
like companion. - family member. - family member, way dog is. - Mm-
hmm. - dog able speak language too. So, not just connect way
dog looking looking away almost like smiling soul
kind way, also actually understand hell, like, excited
successes? Like understand details, understand traumas. that,
just think [sighing] always filled excitement could, artificial
intelligence, bring joy lot people. recently,
heartbroken see kind division, derision, even hate boiling
internet social networks. thought kind mechanism exactly
applicable context social networks well. So, operating system


serves guide internet. One biggest problems YouTube
social networks currently, optimizing engagement. think create AI
systems know individual person, able optimize long-term growth
long-term happiness. - individual, or- - individual, individual.
lot things say, order AI systems learn
everything you, need collect, need just like talk
offline, collecting data others secrets other, way
AI that. allows to, requires rethink ideas
ownership data. think individual data easily
able leave just like AI systems can leave, humans can disappear delete
data moment's notice. actually better humans can do,
load data other, there. think important both, give people
complete control data order establish trust can trust you.
second part trust transparency. Whenever data used make clear
used for. not clear lawyerly legal sense, clear way
people really understand used for. believe people ability
delete data walk away know data used, think
stay. - possibility clean breakup, actually will keep people together. -
Yeah, think so. think, exactly. think happy marriage acquires ability divorce
easily without divorce industrial complex whatever. Things currently going
much money made lawyers divorce. yeah, ability
leave enables love, think. - interesting. heard phrase semi-
cynical friend, marriage leading cause divorce, now heard
divorce, possibility divorce leading cause marriage. - happy
marriage. - Good point. - happy marriage. So, yeah. So, lot details
there, big dream connection AI system human.
haven't. much fear artificial intelligence systems robots
haven't quite found right words express vision vision have,
not like naive, delusional vision like technology going save everybody,
really just positive view ways AI systems can help humans explore
themselves. - love positivity agree stance everything doomed
equally bad say everything's going turn right, dedicated
effort. clearly, thinking dedicated effort look like.
mentioned two aspects dream [clears throat] want make sure


understand connect do, independent streams. One
hypothetical robot family member, form robot allow
people experience kind delight experienced many times,

01:11:33 Improving Social Media

like world able have, beautiful idea
give. social media social network platforms really serve
individuals best selves happiness growth. crossover
those, two parallel dreams? - 100% thing.
difficult kind explain without going details, maybe one easy way
explain way think social networks, create AI system yours.
not like Amazon Alexa centralized, data, like little friend
becomes representative Twitter helps find things will make feel
good, will also challenge thinking make grow, not get that, not let
get lost negative spiral dopamine, gets angry, just
get not open learning. so, little representative optimizing
long-term health. believe not good human beings, also good
business. think longterm, can make lot money challenging idea
way make money, maximizing engagement. one things
people disagree on, think Twitter's always going win. Like maximizing
engagement always going win, don't think so. think people woken now
understanding that, like don't always feel good, ones Twitter lot,
don't always feel good end week. - love feedback
whatever creature, whatever, don't know call it, maybe end
week, automatically unfollow people follow
realized really smart data feeling inside,
sleeping, something that, don't know, just wasn't good me. might also
put things people front see, kind sliver
look like? - whole point, interaction, sharing moments
learning lot you, now able understand interactions led
become better version yourself. Like person happy with.
isn't, flat earth feel good it, believe earth
flat, like idea sensor ridiculous. makes feel good


becoming best version yourself, think getting much flat
earth possible. Now, also good challenge ideas, not
centralized committee decided, tell system like
challenging ideas, think us do. then, actually YouTube doesn't
well, go flat-earth rabbit hole, going see.
nice get really powerful communicators argue flat earth. nice
see you, potentially, least long-term expand horizons, maybe
earth not flat. continue live whole life thinking earth flat,
think, good father son daughter, like best
version happy yourself, think earth flat. So, like think
kind idea, just using kind silly, ridiculous example don't
like idea centralized forces controlling can can't see, also don't
like idea like not censoring anything. always biggest problem
that, central decider, think can decide want
see not, good companion reminds felt last time
this, felt good last time this. - Man, feel like every good story,
guide companion flies out, forges little bit further, little bit
differently brings back information helps us, least tries steer us
right direction. - So, yeah, exactly thinking working on.
mention bunch difficulties here, see little bit
recently. So, technically lot challenges here. Just like lot
technologies, reason talking podcast comfortably opposed
working secret, really hard maybe time not come.
something constantly struggle terms like entrepreneurially
startup, like also mentioned you, maybe offline, really don't care money,

01:16:57 Challenges Creativity

don't care business success, kinds things. So, difficult decision
make, much time want go give everything
this? big roll dice. also realized working
problems, robotics technical side terms machine-learning
system describing, lonely, really lonely. personal level
technical level. So, technical level, surrounded people kind


doubt me, think entrepreneurs go through. doubt following
sense, know difficult is. Like people colleagues mine,
know difficult life-long learning is, also know difficult build system
like this, build competitive social network. general, kind
loneliness just working something long periods time.
start doubt whether, given don't track record success, like
big one. look mirror, especially young, still
that, things, look mirror, like, big dreams,
know actually smart think are? Like know
going able accomplish dream? ambition. - sort don't,
kind pulling string hoping bigger ball yarn. - Yeah.
[Andrew laughing] kind intuition. think pride knowing
good at, reason intuition, 'cause think good
knowing things suck at, basically everything. So, like whenever
notice like, wait minute, kind good this, rare me. think like
that, might ball yarn worth pulling at. thing terms
engineering systems able interact humans, think good that.
talk podcasting on, don't know good
podcasts. - good podcasting, right? - certainly don't, think maybe
compelling people watch kindhearted idiot struggle form, maybe
compelling. terms like actual good engineer human-robot
interaction systems, think good. hard know it,
world keeps telling not, full doll, really hard.
struggling recently, kind fascinating struggle.
Goggins thing comes in, like, aside state-hard motherfucker, the, like
whenever struggling, good sign keep going, going
alone success, right? - Well, case, however, agree. actually David
post recently thought among many brilliant posts, one
brilliant talked myth light end tunnel.
instead, replaced myth with, concept eventually, eyes
adapt dark. tunnel, not light end, really
adapting dark tunnel. Goggins- - love much. - Yeah.
got share lot common knowing bit, share lot common.
loneliness pursuit dream, seems me, certain component


extremely valuable, loneliness serve driver
build companion journey. - Well, deeply aware that. So, like
people can make, 'cause talk love lot, really love everything world,
also love humans, friendship romantic, like even cheesy stuff, just- - like
romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, got much Rogan
like, Tango scene "Scent Woman,"

01:21:49 Suits & Dresses

find like nothing better woman red dress, just like classy- -
move Argentina friend. father's Argentine, know
said went podcast first time? said, dresses well.
Argentina, men go wedding party something, U.S., halfway
night, 10 minutes night, jackets off. - Yeah. - looks like
everyone's undressing party just got dressed for. said, know,
liked way dresses. started, talking you.
started podcast, said, don't wear real suit like friend Lex?

01:22:22 Loneliness

[laughing] - remember that. - No, can't. talk pursuit just bit
more, think talking about, building a, not just solution
loneliness, alluded loneliness itself, important thing. think
right. think within people, like caverns faults shame, also just
desire resonance, seen heard. don't even know seen
heard language. reservoirs loneliness, think, well,
interesting, maybe comment little bit it. just often
talk love, haven't quantified it, seems talk loneliness,
maybe just willing, share little bit that,
feels like now pursuit building robot-human relationship. been,
let direct, spending lot time building robot-human
relationship, at? - Oh, terms business, terms systems? - No,
talking specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, mention things.
So, one, startup idea hope millions people can use.


personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going
stairs, saw slip. big guy, wasn't 200 pounds,
90 pounds, bulldog, pretty big fit. noticed
wasn't carrying foot back like injured, no feeling all.
never liked touch hind paws, do, thing just flopping there.
vet found spinal degeneration told next one
go. suffer? Sure, hope not, something changed eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah,
eyes again, know spend long hours phone tell
like eyes convey mean internal states


sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking
Costello peeing. losing ability stand that, falling
that. think started realize. passage easy
peaceful, say this, not ashamed say it, mean, wake every morning
since just, don't even make conscious decision allow self cry, wake
crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief
moment. - Yeah. gone. - the, going gone lot people
too. - Well, struggling with. think maybe pretty good this.
Like, done before? [Andrew laughing] challenge. actually
part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

question what, can create realm bigger, deeper
effect human beings societies, can terrifying process. me,
exciting process supervise correctly, inject, called value
alignment, make sure goals AI optimizing aligned human
beings human societies. lot fascinating things talk within
specifics neural networks problems people working on.
say really big, exciting one self-supervised learning. trying get less
less human supervision, less less human supervision neural networks. also
just comment shut up. - No, please keep going. learning. questions,
learning. please keep going. - So, exciting not theory,
always application. One exciting applications artificial intelligence,
specifically neural networks machine learning Tesla Autopilot.
systems working real world. isn't academic exercise.
human lives stake. safety-critical. - automated vehicles.
Autonomous vehicles. - Semi-autonomous. want be. - Okay. - gone
wars topics, - Semi-autonomous vehicles. - Semi-autonomous. So,
even though called FSD, Full Self-Driving, currently not fully autonomous,
meaning human supervision required. So, human tasked overseeing
systems. fact, liability-wise, human always responsible. human factor
psychology question, fascinating. fascinated whole space,
whole 'nother space human robot interaction AI systems humans work
together accomplish tasks. dance one smaller communities,
think will one important open problems solved,
humans robots dance together. me, semi-autonomous driving one
spaces. Elon, example, doesn't see way, sees semi-autonomous
driving stepping stone towards fully autonomous driving. Like, humans robots
can't dance well together. Like, humans humans dance robots robots
dance. Like, need to, engineering problem, need design perfect
robot solves problem. forever, maybe not case driving,
world going full problems always humans robots interact,
think robots will always flawed, just like humans going flawed,
flawed. makes life beautiful, flawed. learning
happens edge capabilities. always figure out, can
flawed robots flawed humans interact together they, like sum bigger


whole, opposed focusing just building perfect robot? - Mm-hmm. -
one exciting applications say artificial intelligence
autonomous driving, semi-autonomous driving. really good example
machine learning systems constantly learning. process
maybe can comment on, the, Andrej Karpathy head autopilot
calls data engine. process applies lot machine learning,
build system pretty good stuff, send real world,
starts stuff runs called edge cases, like failure cases,
screws up. kids. have- - adults. -
adults. Exactly. learn really quickly. whole point,
fascinating thing driving, realize millions edge cases. just
like weird situations not expect. data engine process
collect edge cases, go back drawing board learn
them. create data pipeline cars, hundreds
thousands cars driving around something weird happens. whenever
weird detector fires, another important concept, piece data goes back
mothership training, retraining system. data
engine process, keeps improving getting better better better better.
basically send pretty clever AI systems world let find
edge cases, let screw just enough figure edge cases are,
go back learn them, send new version keep updating
version. - updating done humans? - annotation done humans.
The, to, weird examples come back, edge cases,
label actually happened there. also mechanisms automatically
labeling, mostly, think always rely humans improve,
understand happening weird cases. lot debate.
this, thing, artificial intelligence? bunch smart people
different opinions intelligence. AI basically community
people don't agree anything. - seems case. First all,
beautiful description terms heard many times among colleagues
Stanford, meetings outside world. many fascinating things.
many questions, want ask one question culture AI,
seem community least outsider, seems
like little consensus terms operational definitions


even mean. seems lot splitting happening now not just
supervised unsupervised learning, sort intermediate conditions
machines autonomous, go back instruction like kids go home
college summer get little, moms still feeds eventually
leave nest kind thing. something particular engineers,
people realm engineering think lends disagreement? - Yeah,
think, so, first all, specific get, less disagreement is.
lot disagreement artificial intelligence, less disagreement
machine learning even less talk active learning
machine teaching self-supervised learning. get like NLP
language models transformers, get specific neural network
architectures, less less less disagreement terms.
might hearing disagreement high-level terms,
fact engineering, especially talking intelligence systems little
bit art science. art part thing creates disagreements,
start disagreements easy difficult particular
problem is. example, lot people disagree Elon difficult problem
autonomous driving is. so, nobody knows. lot disagreement
about, limits techniques? that, terminology also
contains within disagreements. overall, think also young science
also that. like not just engineering, artificial intelligence truly
large-scale discipline, thousands, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands people working it, huge amounts money made recent
thing. trying figure terms. And, course, egos
personalities lot fame made. Like term deep learning, example,
neural networks around many, many decades since '60s, can
argue since '40s. rebranding neural networks word, deep
learning, term, deep learning, part re-invigoration field,
really exact thing. - didn't know that. mean, grew age
neuroscience neural networks discussed, computational neuroscience
theoretical neuroscience, journals. wasn't actually taken terribly
seriously experimentalists years ago. say five seven years
ago. Excellent theoretical neuroscientist like Larry Abbott colleagues, certainly
Stanford well people started paying attention computational methods.


terms, neural networks, computational methods, actually didn't know neural
network works deep learning now become kind synonymous. -
No, always thing. - Interesting. was, so. - neuroscientist
didn't know that. - So, well, neural networks probably means something else
neural science not something else, little different flavor depending field.
fascinating too, neuroscience AI people started working
together dancing lot recent,

00:26:46 Machine & Human Learning

say probably decade. - Oh, machines going brain. couple
questions, one thing sort fixated find incredibly interesting
example gave playing game mutated version competitor.
- Yeah. - find incredibly interesting kind parallel mirror
happens try learn humans, generate repetitions
whatever trying learn, make errors. Occasionally succeed.
simple example, instance, trying throw bulls eyes dartboard. - Yeah. -
going errors, errors, errors. probably miss dartboard. maybe
occasionally, hit bullseye. don't know exactly just did, right?
say playing darts version wearing visual prism,
like visual, visual defect, learn certain things mode well.
saying machine can sort mutate itself, mutation always cause
deficiency needs overcome? mutations biology sometimes give
us super powers, right? Occasionally, get somebody better 2020
vision, can see better 99.9% people there. So, talk
machine playing game mutated version itself, mutation always say
call negative mutation, adaptive maladaptive mutation? - No,
don't know get, so, mutate first figure compete
other. - So, evolving, machine gets evolve real time. -
Yeah. think it, exciting actually humans.
not just. So, usually freeze version system. So, really take Andrew
yesterday make 10 clones them. maybe mutate, maybe not.
bunch competitions Andrew today, like fight
death, wins last. So, love idea like creating bunch clones


like day past year, just seeing going better
like podcasting science, picking chicks bar don't know, competing
Jujitsu. one way it, mean, lot Lexes die
process, essentially happens, reinforcement learning
self-play mechanisms, graveyard systems didn't well.
surviving, good ones survive. - think that, mean, Darwin's Theory
Evolution might worked sense way, population level.
mean, get bunch birds different shaped beaks birds
shaped beak allows get seeds. mean, trivially simple example
Darwinian evolution, think correct even though not exhaustive.
referring to? essentially normally done members
different species, lots different members species different traits get
selected for, actually create multiple versions different
traits. - So, with, probably said this, perhaps implied machine
learning, reinforcement learning processes. One big
requirements, objective function, loss function, utility function,
different terms thing, like equation says good,
trying optimize equation. So, clear goal
systems. - game, like chess, goal. - anything.
Anything want machine learning solve, needs objective function.
machine learning, usually called Loss Function, optimizing.
interesting thing evolution, complicated course, goal also seems
evolving. Like a, guess, adaptation environment, goal,
unclear can convert always. like survival fittest. unclear
fittest is. machine learning, starting point, like human ingenuity
provides, fitness function good bad, lets know
systems going win. So, need equation like that. One
fascinating things humans, figure objective functions ourselves.
Like meaning life, like hell here? machine currently
hard-coded statement why. - meaning of- - Yeah. -
Artificial intelligence-based life. - Right. can't. So, like lot interesting
explorations function curiosity, learning new things
kind stuff, still hard coded. want machine able
good stuff, given clear statements good stuff means.


one challenges artificial intelligence, formalize the, order
solve problem, formalize provide like full
sensory information, clear data
collected, also clear objective function.

00:32:21 Curiosity

goal trying reach? difficult thing artificial
intelligence. - love mentioned curiosity, sure definition falls short
many ways, define curiosity strong interest knowing something, without
attachment outcome. sort a, random search, not
really emotional attachment, really just desire discover unveil
without hoping gold coin rock, just looking rocks.
less the, within machine learning, sounds like elements
reward prediction rewards. machine know done right thing.
So, can make machines curious, sorts machines
describing, curious design? - Yeah, curiosity kind symptom, not goal. So,
happens, one big trade-offs reinforcement learning, exploration
versus exploitation. So, know little, pays off explore lot, even
suboptimal, like even trajectories seem like not going lead anywhere,
called exploration. smarter smarter smarter get,
emphasis put exploitation, meaning take best solution, take best
path. Now, process, exploration can look like curiosity us humans,
really just trying get local optimal, thing already discovered.
AI perspective, always looking optimize objective function, derives,
can talk slot more, terms tools machine learning today,
derives no pleasure just curiosity like, don't know, discovery. - So,
no dopamine machine learning. - no dopamine. - no reward, system
chemical, guess electronic-reward system. - said, look machine
learning literature reinforcement learning literature, will use, like deep mind,
use terms like dopamine, constantly trying use human brain inspire totally
new solutions problems. So, think like, dopamine function
human brain, can lead interesting ways discover optimal
solutions? ultimately currently, formal objective function. Now,


argue humans also set objective functions try optimize,
just not able introspect them. - Yeah, don't actually know looking
seeking doing. - Well, like Lisa Feldman Barrett spoken least
Instagram, hope you- - met you, yeah. - Yeah, hope actually
podcast. - Yes, terrific. - So, very,
homeostasis like that. Basically, dumb objective function brain
trying optimize, like keep like body temperature same. Like dom
kind optimization function happening. humans fancy
consciousness cognitive abilities, tell stories can nice
podcasts, really brain trying maintain a, just like healthy state, guess.
fascinating. also see human brain, hope artificial intelligence systems,
not just systems solve problems, optimize goal, also storytellers.
think power telling stories. tell stories other,
communication is. Like alone, solve problems,
makes sense talk solving problems. community,
capability communicate, tell stories, share ideas way ideas
stable long period time, like, charismatic storyteller.
think humans good this. Arguably, argue
are, great storytellers. AI hope will also become that. So, not
just able solve problems clear objective function,

00:36:55 Story Telling Robots

afterwards, able tell like way better, like make way better story
something, failed. - So, think robots or, and/or
machines sort going start telling human stories? - Well, definitely. So,
technical field called Explainable AI, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, trying
figure get AI system explain us humans hell failed,
succeeded, lot different sort versions this, visualize
understands world. really difficult problem, especially neural networks
famously opaque, don't understand many cases, particular
neural network well, try figure going fail,
requires AI explain itself. huge amount money, like huge
amount money this, especially government funding on.


want deploy AI systems real world, humans least, want ask
question like, hell that? Like dark way, just kill
person, right? Like car ran person, want understand happened.
now again, sometimes unfair AI systems humans can
often not explain well. field Explainable AI people
interested rely AI systems, like Twitter
recommender system, AI algorithm that's, say impacting elections, perhaps
starting wars, least military conflict, algorithm, want ask algorithm,
first all, know hell doing? understand society-level
effects having? can explain possible trajectories? Like
kind conversation human, want able
AI. personal level, think nice talk AI systems stupid
stuff, like robots fail to- - Why'd fall stairs? - Yeah. not
engineering question, almost like endearing question, like looking for, fell
hanging out, don't think need explanation exactly
dynamics, like actuated system problem here? Like
texture floor? on. like, the- - No, want know
thinking. - That, might joke like, drunk again, go home, something,
like humor it, opportunity. Like storytelling, isn't just
explanation happened, something makes people laugh, makes people
fall love, makes people dream, understand things way poetry makes
people understand things opposed rigorous log every sensor was,
every actuator was. - mean, find incredible one hallmarks
severe autism spectrum disorders is, report experience autistic person
much catalog action steps. like, feel today? say,
well, got this, this, this. not way
person doesn't autism spectrum disorder respond. way
describe machines much humanism,

00:40:48 Defines Robot?

much human biological element, realized talking
machines. want make sure understand distinction
machine learns, machine artificial intelligence robot. Like point


machine become robot? So, ballpoint pen, assuming wouldn't
call robot, ballpoint pen can come moved opposite
side table, moves whatever mechanism, point, become
robot? - Okay, 1 million ways explore question. fascinating one. So,
first all, question life? Like know something living
form not? question sort a, maybe cold
computational system becomes a, already loading words lot meaning,
robot machine, So, one, think movement important, kind boring
idea robot just machine able act world. So, one artificial
intelligence just thinking thing, think machine learning
is, also acting thing, usually think robots. So, robots
things perception system able take world however
define world, able think learn whatever hell inside,
act world. So, difference maybe AI system learning
machine robot, something able, robot something able
perceive world act world. - So, language sound,
movement both. - Yeah. think also digital
space long aspect entity inside machine world
outside machine. sense machine sensing world
acting it. - So, could, instance, version robot, according
definition think providing, robot, go sleep night
robot goes forges information thinks want see loaded onto
desktop morning. no movement machine, no
language, essentially, movement cyberspace. - Yeah, distinction
think important element entity, whether
digital physical space. So, something like Alexa home,
speech recognition, Alexa doing, constantly sent
back mothership. Alexa own, me, robot,
interacting world. simply finger main mothership,
Alexa not robot, just interaction device, may main
Amazon Alexa AI, big, big system robot. So, important
element, us humans, think, want entity, whether
digital physical space, ideas consciousness come
kinds things project understanding means being.



00:44:30 Magic & Surprise

so, take further, machine become robot, think
special moment. special moment person's life robot's life
surprises you. think surprise really powerful thing, know thing
works yet surprises you, magical moment us humans. So, whether
chess-playing program something haven't seen before, makes
people smile like, huh, moments happen AlphaZero first time chess
playing, grand masters really surprised move. didn't understand
move studied studied understood it.
moment surprise, grandmasters chess. find moment surprise
really powerful, really magical just everyday life. - supersedes human
brain moment? - So, not supersedes, like outperforms, surprises
positive sense. Like didn't think that, didn't think you.
think moment big transition robot moment servant
accomplishes particular task level accuracy, rate
failure, entity, struggling just like world.
really important moment think not going find many people AI
community talk like just did. not speaking like philosopher hippie,
speaking purely engineering perspective. think really important robots
become entities explore real engineering problem, opposed
everybody treats robots robotics community, don't even call
she, don't give them, try avoid giving names, really want see like
system, like servant. see servant trying accomplish task.
me, don't think just romanticizing notion, think being, currently
perhaps dumb being, long arc history, humans pretty dumb beings
too, so- - agree statement. [Andrew laughing] - So, tend really want
explore treating robots really entities, yeah. So, like anthropomorphization,
sort act looking inanimate object projecting onto life-like
features, think robotics generally sees negative, see superpower. Like
that, need use that. - Well, struck really grabs onto relationship

00:47:37 Robots Change Us



human machine, human robot. So, guess simple question is,
think already told us answer, interacting robot change
you? words, develop relationships robots? - Yeah, definitely think so.
think moment see robot AI systems just servants entities,
begin change you, just like good friends do, just like relationships just
humans. think that, certain aspects interaction. Like
robot's ability say no, sense identity, set goals,
not constantly serving you, instead, trying understand world
dance understanding communication you. So, definitely think a,
mean, lot thoughts may know, core
life-long dream actually want do, believe people
notion loneliness haven't discovered, haven't explored,
say. see AI systems helping us explore can become
better humans, better people towards other. So, think connection
human AI, human robot, not possible, will help us understand
ways like several orders magnitude deeper ever
imagined. tend believe [sighing]

00:49:35 Relationships Defined

well, wild levels belief terms impactful will be, right? - So,
think human relationships, don't always break variables,
explore variables see map human-robot
relationships. One just time, right? spend zero time another person
cyberspace phone person, essentially no relationship them.
spend lot time, relationship, obvious. guess one variable
time, much time spend entity, robot human.
wins successes. enjoy successes together. give absolutely
trivial example moment, failures. struggle
somebody, whether not struggle one another, disagree, like
really struck fact said robot saying no, never thought
robot saying no me, is. - look forward one first people
send robots to. - I. So, struggle. struggle somebody,


grow closer. Sometimes struggles imposed two people,
called trauma bonding, call whole psychology literature pop psychology
literature. case, can imagine. So, time successes together, struggle together,
just peaceful time, hanging home, watching movies, waking near one
another, here, breaking elements relationships kind. So,
think elements apply robot-human relationships? so, see
how, robot entity autonomy terms reacts
you, not just just serve you, not just servant, actually opinions,
can tell maybe thinking flawed, actions flawed. - can
also leave. - also leave. So, never conceptualized robot-human interactions
way. So, tell might look. thinking human-
appearing robot? know intense relationships our,
separate dogs obviously, animals, sounds lot like human-animal interaction.
So, ideal human-robot relationship? - So, lot said here,
actually pinpointed one big, big first steps, idea time.
huge limitation machine-learning community currently. Now back like
actual details. Life-long learning problem space focuses AI systems can
learn long period time. currently machine learning systems not
able do, things listed time, successes, failures,
just chilling together watching movies, AI systems not able that,
beautiful, magical moments believe days filled with, not able keep
track together you. - 'Cause can't move you. -
No, no, like literally don't techniques learning, actual learning
containing moments. Current machine-learning systems really focused
understanding world following way, like perception system, like
looking around, understand like scene. bunch people
sitting down, cameras microphones, table, understand
that. fact shared moment talking today, still remember
like next time something, remember moment happened. don't
know technique-wise. hoping innovate think
very, important component means create deeper relationship,
sharing moments together. - post photo robot, like selfie
robot robot sees image recognizes time spent,
smiles, tears- - Yeah. - create sort metric emotional depth


relationship update behavior? - So. - it... texts middle
night say, haven't texted back? - Well, yes, things,
can dig that. think time element, forget everything else, just sharing
moments together, changes everything. believe changes everything. Now,
specific things terms systems can explain you.
technical probably little bit offline, 'cause kind wild ideas can
revolutionize social networks operating systems. point element alone,
forget things talking like emotions, saying no, that, just
remembering sharing moments together change everything. don't currently
systems share moments together. Like even just fridge, just
times, went late night ate thing shouldn't eaten,
secret moment refrigerator. shared moment, darkness
beautiful moment just like heartbroken reason,
eating ice cream whatever, special moment. refrigerator
you, fact missed opportunity remember tragic.
remember that, think going attached refrigerator.
going go hell refrigerator. us have, like
developed world, weird relationships food, right? So, can go
deep moments trauma triumph food, core that,
refrigerator. So, smart refrigerator, believe change society. Not just
refrigerator, ideas systems around us. So, just want comment
powerful idea time is. bunch elements actual
interaction allowing human feel like heard. Truly heard, truly
understood, human, like deep friendship like that, think, still
element selfishness, still element not really able understand
another human. lot times going trauma together,
difficult times successes, actually starting get inkling
understanding other, think done aggressively,
efficiently. Like think great therapist, think never actually
therapist, believer used want psychiatrist. - Russians go
therapists? - No, don't. don't. do, therapist don't live tell
story. believe talk therapy, friendship me, talk therapy, like
don't even necessarily need talk [laughing] like just connecting
space ideas space experiences. think lot ideas


make AI systems able ask right questions truly hear another human.
try podcasting, right? think ways AI.
else, just remembering collection moments make day,
week, months, think maybe well. closest
friends still friends high school. time, bunch
together, like different people. just fact
that, remember moments, moments somehow create
depth connection like nothing else, like refrigerator. - love
graduate advisor, unfortunately, passed away, passed away,
somebody said memorial amazing things done, et cetera.
kids got there, young children knew
pregnant them. so, really, even now can feel like heart
gets heavy, thinking this, going grow without mother.
really amazing, strong young girls, now young women. said
incredible, said really appreciated mother,
amazing person, unstructured time spent together. - Mm-hmm. - So,
wasn't trips zoo, wasn't woke five morning drove us
school. things too. two hour commute direction,
incredible, ran lab, et cetera, unstructured time. So, passing
mother, remembered biggest give bonded
her, time just kind hung out. way describe
relationship refrigerator so, want say human-like, almost reluctant
say that. realizing talking, think
human-like might actually lower form relationship. may relationships
far better sorts relationships can conceive minds right
now based machine relationship interactions teach us.
right? - Yeah, think so. think no reason see machines somehow
incapable teaching us something deeply human. don't think humans
monopoly that. think understand poorly need
kind prompting machine. definitely part that, just remembering
moments. think unstructured time together, wonder quite unstructured.
like calling podcast structured time. - Maybe meant,
wasn't big outing, no specific goal, goal created lack
goal. Like just hang start playing, thumb war,


end playing thumb war hour. So, structure emerges lack
structure. - No, thing moments, something times
creates special moments, think optimized for. think think like
big outing as, don't know, going Six Flags something, big, Grand
Canyon, go some, don't know, think need to, don't quite yet
understand, humans, creates magical moments. think possible optimize
lot things. perhaps like podcasting helping people discover that, like
maybe thing want optimize isn't necessarily like sexy, like quick clips,
maybe want, long-form authenticity. - Depth. - Depth. So, trying
figure out, certainly deep connection humans humans NAS
systems, think long conversations, long periods communication series
moments like new, perhaps, seemingly insignificant big ones, big
successes, big failures, just stitching together talking
throughout. think formula really, really deep connection. like
specific engineering perspective, think fascinating open problem
really worked much. me, a, guts

01:02:29 Lex’s Dream Humanity

and, mean lot things say, one guts, build startup around
it. - So, talk startup talk dream. mentioned
dream previous conversations, always little hints dropped
there. Just anyone listening, never offline conversation
dream, not privy anything, except Lex says now. realized
no way capture full essence dream kind verbal statement way
captures it. dream referred now several times
sat together talked phone? Maybe company,
maybe something distinct. feel comfortable, it'd great share
little bit is. - Sure. So, way people express long-term vision,
noticed quite different. Like Elon example somebody can crisply say
exactly goal is. Also fact problems solving
nothing humans. So, long-term vision little bit difficult express
words, noticed, tried, brain's failure, way
sneak it. So, let just say things. Early life also recent


years, interacted robots understood magic there.
magic shared millions brought light. first met Spot
Boston Dynamics, realized magic nobody else seeing. - dog.
- dog, sorry. Spot four-legged robot Boston Dynamics. people
might seen it, yellow dog. sometimes life, just notice something
just grabs you. believe something magic something
every single device world. way think maybe Steve Jobs
thought personal computer, laws didn't think personal computer
way, Steve did. like, thought personal computer
thin sheet paper everybody one, idea, think
heartbreaking getting, world filled machines
soulless. think every one can magic. One things
also inspired terms startup, magic can engineered much easier
thought. intuition everything ever built worked on. So, dream
add bit magic every single computing system world. So, way
Windows Operating System long time primary operating system
everybody interacted with, built apps top it. think something
layer, almost operating system every device humans
interacted world. Now, actually looks like, actual dream
officially kid, didn't concrete form business, dream
exploring loneliness interacting machines, robots. deep
connection humans robots always dream. so, me, love
see world every home robot, not robot washes
dishes, sex robot, don't know, think kind activity robot can do,
like companion. - family member. - family member, way dog is. - Mm-
hmm. - dog able speak language too. So, not just connect way
dog looking looking away almost like smiling soul
kind way, also actually understand hell, like, excited
successes? Like understand details, understand traumas. that,
just think [sighing] always filled excitement could, artificial
intelligence, bring joy lot people. recently,
heartbroken see kind division, derision, even hate boiling
internet social networks. thought kind mechanism exactly
applicable context social networks well. So, operating system


serves guide internet. One biggest problems YouTube
social networks currently, optimizing engagement. think create AI
systems know individual person, able optimize long-term growth
long-term happiness. - individual, or- - individual, individual.
lot things say, order AI systems learn
everything you, need collect, need just like talk
offline, collecting data others secrets other, way
AI that. allows to, requires rethink ideas
ownership data. think individual data easily
able leave just like AI systems can leave, humans can disappear delete
data moment's notice. actually better humans can do,
load data other, there. think important both, give people
complete control data order establish trust can trust you.
second part trust transparency. Whenever data used make clear
used for. not clear lawyerly legal sense, clear way
people really understand used for. believe people ability
delete data walk away know data used, think
stay. - possibility clean breakup, actually will keep people together. -
Yeah, think so. think, exactly. think happy marriage acquires ability divorce
easily without divorce industrial complex whatever. Things currently going
much money made lawyers divorce. yeah, ability
leave enables love, think. - interesting. heard phrase semi-
cynical friend, marriage leading cause divorce, now heard
divorce, possibility divorce leading cause marriage. - happy
marriage. - Good point. - happy marriage. So, yeah. So, lot details
there, big dream connection AI system human.
haven't. much fear artificial intelligence systems robots
haven't quite found right words express vision vision have,
not like naive, delusional vision like technology going save everybody,
really just positive view ways AI systems can help humans explore
themselves. - love positivity agree stance everything doomed
equally bad say everything's going turn right, dedicated
effort. clearly, thinking dedicated effort look like.
mentioned two aspects dream [clears throat] want make sure


understand connect do, independent streams. One
hypothetical robot family member, form robot allow
people experience kind delight experienced many times,

01:11:33 Improving Social Media

like world able have, beautiful idea
give. social media social network platforms really serve
individuals best selves happiness growth. crossover
those, two parallel dreams? - 100% thing.
difficult kind explain without going details, maybe one easy way
explain way think social networks, create AI system yours.
not like Amazon Alexa centralized, data, like little friend
becomes representative Twitter helps find things will make feel
good, will also challenge thinking make grow, not get that, not let
get lost negative spiral dopamine, gets angry, just
get not open learning. so, little representative optimizing
long-term health. believe not good human beings, also good
business. think longterm, can make lot money challenging idea
way make money, maximizing engagement. one things
people disagree on, think Twitter's always going win. Like maximizing
engagement always going win, don't think so. think people woken now
understanding that, like don't always feel good, ones Twitter lot,
don't always feel good end week. - love feedback
whatever creature, whatever, don't know call it, maybe end
week, automatically unfollow people follow
realized really smart data feeling inside,
sleeping, something that, don't know, just wasn't good me. might also
put things people front see, kind sliver
look like? - whole point, interaction, sharing moments
learning lot you, now able understand interactions led
become better version yourself. Like person happy with.
isn't, flat earth feel good it, believe earth
flat, like idea sensor ridiculous. makes feel good


becoming best version yourself, think getting much flat
earth possible. Now, also good challenge ideas, not
centralized committee decided, tell system like
challenging ideas, think us do. then, actually YouTube doesn't
well, go flat-earth rabbit hole, going see.
nice get really powerful communicators argue flat earth. nice
see you, potentially, least long-term expand horizons, maybe
earth not flat. continue live whole life thinking earth flat,
think, good father son daughter, like best
version happy yourself, think earth flat. So, like think
kind idea, just using kind silly, ridiculous example don't
like idea centralized forces controlling can can't see, also don't
like idea like not censoring anything. always biggest problem
that, central decider, think can decide want
see not, good companion reminds felt last time
this, felt good last time this. - Man, feel like every good story,
guide companion flies out, forges little bit further, little bit
differently brings back information helps us, least tries steer us
right direction. - So, yeah, exactly thinking working on.
mention bunch difficulties here, see little bit
recently. So, technically lot challenges here. Just like lot
technologies, reason talking podcast comfortably opposed
working secret, really hard maybe time not come.
something constantly struggle terms like entrepreneurially
startup, like also mentioned you, maybe offline, really don't care money,

01:16:57 Challenges Creativity

don't care business success, kinds things. So, difficult decision
make, much time want go give everything
this? big roll dice. also realized working
problems, robotics technical side terms machine-learning
system describing, lonely, really lonely. personal level
technical level. So, technical level, surrounded people kind


doubt me, think entrepreneurs go through. doubt following
sense, know difficult is. Like people colleagues mine,
know difficult life-long learning is, also know difficult build system
like this, build competitive social network. general, kind
loneliness just working something long periods time.
start doubt whether, given don't track record success, like
big one. look mirror, especially young, still
that, things, look mirror, like, big dreams,
know actually smart think are? Like know
going able accomplish dream? ambition. - sort don't,
kind pulling string hoping bigger ball yarn. - Yeah.
[Andrew laughing] kind intuition. think pride knowing
good at, reason intuition, 'cause think good
knowing things suck at, basically everything. So, like whenever
notice like, wait minute, kind good this, rare me. think like
that, might ball yarn worth pulling at. thing terms
engineering systems able interact humans, think good that.
talk podcasting on, don't know good
podcasts. - good podcasting, right? - certainly don't, think maybe
compelling people watch kindhearted idiot struggle form, maybe
compelling. terms like actual good engineer human-robot
interaction systems, think good. hard know it,
world keeps telling not, full doll, really hard.
struggling recently, kind fascinating struggle.
Goggins thing comes in, like, aside state-hard motherfucker, the, like
whenever struggling, good sign keep going, going
alone success, right? - Well, case, however, agree. actually David
post recently thought among many brilliant posts, one
brilliant talked myth light end tunnel.
instead, replaced myth with, concept eventually, eyes
adapt dark. tunnel, not light end, really
adapting dark tunnel. Goggins- - love much. - Yeah.
got share lot common knowing bit, share lot common.
loneliness pursuit dream, seems me, certain component


extremely valuable, loneliness serve driver
build companion journey. - Well, deeply aware that. So, like
people can make, 'cause talk love lot, really love everything world,
also love humans, friendship romantic, like even cheesy stuff, just- - like
romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, got much Rogan
like, Tango scene "Scent Woman,"

01:21:49 Suits & Dresses

find like nothing better woman red dress, just like classy- -
move Argentina friend. father's Argentine, know
said went podcast first time? said, dresses well.
Argentina, men go wedding party something, U.S., halfway
night, 10 minutes night, jackets off. - Yeah. - looks like
everyone's undressing party just got dressed for. said, know,
liked way dresses. started, talking you.
started podcast, said, don't wear real suit like friend Lex?

01:22:22 Loneliness

[laughing] - remember that. - No, can't. talk pursuit just bit
more, think talking about, building a, not just solution
loneliness, alluded loneliness itself, important thing. think
right. think within people, like caverns faults shame, also just
desire resonance, seen heard. don't even know seen
heard language. reservoirs loneliness, think, well,
interesting, maybe comment little bit it. just often
talk love, haven't quantified it, seems talk loneliness,
maybe just willing, share little bit that,
feels like now pursuit building robot-human relationship. been,
let direct, spending lot time building robot-human
relationship, at? - Oh, terms business, terms systems? - No,
talking specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, mention things.
So, one, startup idea hope millions people can use.


personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going
stairs, saw slip. big guy, wasn't 200 pounds,
90 pounds, bulldog, pretty big fit. noticed
wasn't carrying foot back like injured, no feeling all.
never liked touch hind paws, do, thing just flopping there.
vet found spinal degeneration told next one
go. suffer? Sure, hope not, something changed eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah,
eyes again, know spend long hours phone tell
like eyes convey mean internal states


sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking
Costello peeing. losing ability stand that, falling
that. think started realize. passage easy
peaceful, say this, not ashamed say it, mean, wake every morning
since just, don't even make conscious decision allow self cry, wake
crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief
moment. - Yeah. gone. - the, going gone lot people
too. - Well, struggling with. think maybe pretty good this.
Like, done before? [Andrew laughing] challenge. actually
part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

whole, opposed focusing just building perfect robot? - Mm-hmm. -
one exciting applications say artificial intelligence
autonomous driving, semi-autonomous driving. really good example
machine learning systems constantly learning. process
maybe can comment on, the, Andrej Karpathy head autopilot
calls data engine. process applies lot machine learning,
build system pretty good stuff, send real world,
starts stuff runs called edge cases, like failure cases,
screws up. kids. have- - adults. -
adults. Exactly. learn really quickly. whole point,
fascinating thing driving, realize millions edge cases. just
like weird situations not expect. data engine process
collect edge cases, go back drawing board learn
them. create data pipeline cars, hundreds
thousands cars driving around something weird happens. whenever
weird detector fires, another important concept, piece data goes back
mothership training, retraining system. data
engine process, keeps improving getting better better better better.
basically send pretty clever AI systems world let find
edge cases, let screw just enough figure edge cases are,
go back learn them, send new version keep updating
version. - updating done humans? - annotation done humans.
The, to, weird examples come back, edge cases,
label actually happened there. also mechanisms automatically
labeling, mostly, think always rely humans improve,
understand happening weird cases. lot debate.
this, thing, artificial intelligence? bunch smart people
different opinions intelligence. AI basically community
people don't agree anything. - seems case. First all,
beautiful description terms heard many times among colleagues
Stanford, meetings outside world. many fascinating things.
many questions, want ask one question culture AI,
seem community least outsider, seems
like little consensus terms operational definitions


even mean. seems lot splitting happening now not just
supervised unsupervised learning, sort intermediate conditions
machines autonomous, go back instruction like kids go home
college summer get little, moms still feeds eventually
leave nest kind thing. something particular engineers,
people realm engineering think lends disagreement? - Yeah,
think, so, first all, specific get, less disagreement is.
lot disagreement artificial intelligence, less disagreement
machine learning even less talk active learning
machine teaching self-supervised learning. get like NLP
language models transformers, get specific neural network
architectures, less less less disagreement terms.
might hearing disagreement high-level terms,
fact engineering, especially talking intelligence systems little
bit art science. art part thing creates disagreements,
start disagreements easy difficult particular
problem is. example, lot people disagree Elon difficult problem
autonomous driving is. so, nobody knows. lot disagreement
about, limits techniques? that, terminology also
contains within disagreements. overall, think also young science
also that. like not just engineering, artificial intelligence truly
large-scale discipline, thousands, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands people working it, huge amounts money made recent
thing. trying figure terms. And, course, egos
personalities lot fame made. Like term deep learning, example,
neural networks around many, many decades since '60s, can
argue since '40s. rebranding neural networks word, deep
learning, term, deep learning, part re-invigoration field,
really exact thing. - didn't know that. mean, grew age
neuroscience neural networks discussed, computational neuroscience
theoretical neuroscience, journals. wasn't actually taken terribly
seriously experimentalists years ago. say five seven years
ago. Excellent theoretical neuroscientist like Larry Abbott colleagues, certainly
Stanford well people started paying attention computational methods.


terms, neural networks, computational methods, actually didn't know neural
network works deep learning now become kind synonymous. -
No, always thing. - Interesting. was, so. - neuroscientist
didn't know that. - So, well, neural networks probably means something else
neural science not something else, little different flavor depending field.
fascinating too, neuroscience AI people started working
together dancing lot recent,

00:26:46 Machine & Human Learning

say probably decade. - Oh, machines going brain. couple
questions, one thing sort fixated find incredibly interesting
example gave playing game mutated version competitor.
- Yeah. - find incredibly interesting kind parallel mirror
happens try learn humans, generate repetitions
whatever trying learn, make errors. Occasionally succeed.
simple example, instance, trying throw bulls eyes dartboard. - Yeah. -
going errors, errors, errors. probably miss dartboard. maybe
occasionally, hit bullseye. don't know exactly just did, right?
say playing darts version wearing visual prism,
like visual, visual defect, learn certain things mode well.
saying machine can sort mutate itself, mutation always cause
deficiency needs overcome? mutations biology sometimes give
us super powers, right? Occasionally, get somebody better 2020
vision, can see better 99.9% people there. So, talk
machine playing game mutated version itself, mutation always say
call negative mutation, adaptive maladaptive mutation? - No,
don't know get, so, mutate first figure compete
other. - So, evolving, machine gets evolve real time. -
Yeah. think it, exciting actually humans.
not just. So, usually freeze version system. So, really take Andrew
yesterday make 10 clones them. maybe mutate, maybe not.
bunch competitions Andrew today, like fight
death, wins last. So, love idea like creating bunch clones


like day past year, just seeing going better
like podcasting science, picking chicks bar don't know, competing
Jujitsu. one way it, mean, lot Lexes die
process, essentially happens, reinforcement learning
self-play mechanisms, graveyard systems didn't well.
surviving, good ones survive. - think that, mean, Darwin's Theory
Evolution might worked sense way, population level.
mean, get bunch birds different shaped beaks birds
shaped beak allows get seeds. mean, trivially simple example
Darwinian evolution, think correct even though not exhaustive.
referring to? essentially normally done members
different species, lots different members species different traits get
selected for, actually create multiple versions different
traits. - So, with, probably said this, perhaps implied machine
learning, reinforcement learning processes. One big
requirements, objective function, loss function, utility function,
different terms thing, like equation says good,
trying optimize equation. So, clear goal
systems. - game, like chess, goal. - anything.
Anything want machine learning solve, needs objective function.
machine learning, usually called Loss Function, optimizing.
interesting thing evolution, complicated course, goal also seems
evolving. Like a, guess, adaptation environment, goal,
unclear can convert always. like survival fittest. unclear
fittest is. machine learning, starting point, like human ingenuity
provides, fitness function good bad, lets know
systems going win. So, need equation like that. One
fascinating things humans, figure objective functions ourselves.
Like meaning life, like hell here? machine currently
hard-coded statement why. - meaning of- - Yeah. -
Artificial intelligence-based life. - Right. can't. So, like lot interesting
explorations function curiosity, learning new things
kind stuff, still hard coded. want machine able
good stuff, given clear statements good stuff means.


one challenges artificial intelligence, formalize the, order
solve problem, formalize provide like full
sensory information, clear data
collected, also clear objective function.

00:32:21 Curiosity

goal trying reach? difficult thing artificial
intelligence. - love mentioned curiosity, sure definition falls short
many ways, define curiosity strong interest knowing something, without
attachment outcome. sort a, random search, not
really emotional attachment, really just desire discover unveil
without hoping gold coin rock, just looking rocks.
less the, within machine learning, sounds like elements
reward prediction rewards. machine know done right thing.
So, can make machines curious, sorts machines
describing, curious design? - Yeah, curiosity kind symptom, not goal. So,
happens, one big trade-offs reinforcement learning, exploration
versus exploitation. So, know little, pays off explore lot, even
suboptimal, like even trajectories seem like not going lead anywhere,
called exploration. smarter smarter smarter get,
emphasis put exploitation, meaning take best solution, take best
path. Now, process, exploration can look like curiosity us humans,
really just trying get local optimal, thing already discovered.
AI perspective, always looking optimize objective function, derives,
can talk slot more, terms tools machine learning today,
derives no pleasure just curiosity like, don't know, discovery. - So,
no dopamine machine learning. - no dopamine. - no reward, system
chemical, guess electronic-reward system. - said, look machine
learning literature reinforcement learning literature, will use, like deep mind,
use terms like dopamine, constantly trying use human brain inspire totally
new solutions problems. So, think like, dopamine function
human brain, can lead interesting ways discover optimal
solutions? ultimately currently, formal objective function. Now,


argue humans also set objective functions try optimize,
just not able introspect them. - Yeah, don't actually know looking
seeking doing. - Well, like Lisa Feldman Barrett spoken least
Instagram, hope you- - met you, yeah. - Yeah, hope actually
podcast. - Yes, terrific. - So, very,
homeostasis like that. Basically, dumb objective function brain
trying optimize, like keep like body temperature same. Like dom
kind optimization function happening. humans fancy
consciousness cognitive abilities, tell stories can nice
podcasts, really brain trying maintain a, just like healthy state, guess.
fascinating. also see human brain, hope artificial intelligence systems,
not just systems solve problems, optimize goal, also storytellers.
think power telling stories. tell stories other,
communication is. Like alone, solve problems,
makes sense talk solving problems. community,
capability communicate, tell stories, share ideas way ideas
stable long period time, like, charismatic storyteller.
think humans good this. Arguably, argue
are, great storytellers. AI hope will also become that. So, not
just able solve problems clear objective function,

00:36:55 Story Telling Robots

afterwards, able tell like way better, like make way better story
something, failed. - So, think robots or, and/or
machines sort going start telling human stories? - Well, definitely. So,
technical field called Explainable AI, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, trying
figure get AI system explain us humans hell failed,
succeeded, lot different sort versions this, visualize
understands world. really difficult problem, especially neural networks
famously opaque, don't understand many cases, particular
neural network well, try figure going fail,
requires AI explain itself. huge amount money, like huge
amount money this, especially government funding on.


want deploy AI systems real world, humans least, want ask
question like, hell that? Like dark way, just kill
person, right? Like car ran person, want understand happened.
now again, sometimes unfair AI systems humans can
often not explain well. field Explainable AI people
interested rely AI systems, like Twitter
recommender system, AI algorithm that's, say impacting elections, perhaps
starting wars, least military conflict, algorithm, want ask algorithm,
first all, know hell doing? understand society-level
effects having? can explain possible trajectories? Like
kind conversation human, want able
AI. personal level, think nice talk AI systems stupid
stuff, like robots fail to- - Why'd fall stairs? - Yeah. not
engineering question, almost like endearing question, like looking for, fell
hanging out, don't think need explanation exactly
dynamics, like actuated system problem here? Like
texture floor? on. like, the- - No, want know
thinking. - That, might joke like, drunk again, go home, something,
like humor it, opportunity. Like storytelling, isn't just
explanation happened, something makes people laugh, makes people
fall love, makes people dream, understand things way poetry makes
people understand things opposed rigorous log every sensor was,
every actuator was. - mean, find incredible one hallmarks
severe autism spectrum disorders is, report experience autistic person
much catalog action steps. like, feel today? say,
well, got this, this, this. not way
person doesn't autism spectrum disorder respond. way
describe machines much humanism,

00:40:48 Defines Robot?

much human biological element, realized talking
machines. want make sure understand distinction
machine learns, machine artificial intelligence robot. Like point


machine become robot? So, ballpoint pen, assuming wouldn't
call robot, ballpoint pen can come moved opposite
side table, moves whatever mechanism, point, become
robot? - Okay, 1 million ways explore question. fascinating one. So,
first all, question life? Like know something living
form not? question sort a, maybe cold
computational system becomes a, already loading words lot meaning,
robot machine, So, one, think movement important, kind boring
idea robot just machine able act world. So, one artificial
intelligence just thinking thing, think machine learning
is, also acting thing, usually think robots. So, robots
things perception system able take world however
define world, able think learn whatever hell inside,
act world. So, difference maybe AI system learning
machine robot, something able, robot something able
perceive world act world. - So, language sound,
movement both. - Yeah. think also digital
space long aspect entity inside machine world
outside machine. sense machine sensing world
acting it. - So, could, instance, version robot, according
definition think providing, robot, go sleep night
robot goes forges information thinks want see loaded onto
desktop morning. no movement machine, no
language, essentially, movement cyberspace. - Yeah, distinction
think important element entity, whether
digital physical space. So, something like Alexa home,
speech recognition, Alexa doing, constantly sent
back mothership. Alexa own, me, robot,
interacting world. simply finger main mothership,
Alexa not robot, just interaction device, may main
Amazon Alexa AI, big, big system robot. So, important
element, us humans, think, want entity, whether
digital physical space, ideas consciousness come
kinds things project understanding means being.

so, take further, machine become robot, think
special moment. special moment person's life robot's life
surprises you. think surprise really powerful thing, know thing
works yet surprises you, magical moment us humans. So, whether
chess-playing program something haven't seen before, makes
people smile like, huh, moments happen AlphaZero first time chess
playing, grand masters really surprised move. didn't understand
move studied studied understood it.
moment surprise, grandmasters chess. find moment surprise
really powerful, really magical just everyday life. - supersedes human
brain moment? - So, not supersedes, like outperforms, surprises
positive sense. Like didn't think that, didn't think you.
think moment big transition robot moment servant
accomplishes particular task level accuracy, rate
failure, entity, struggling just like world.
really important moment think not going find many people AI
community talk like just did. not speaking like philosopher hippie,
speaking purely engineering perspective. think really important robots
become entities explore real engineering problem, opposed
everybody treats robots robotics community, don't even call
she, don't give them, try avoid giving names, really want see like
system, like servant. see servant trying accomplish task.
me, don't think just romanticizing notion, think being, currently
perhaps dumb being, long arc history, humans pretty dumb beings
too, so- - agree statement. [Andrew laughing] - So, tend really want
explore treating robots really entities, yeah. So, like anthropomorphization,
sort act looking inanimate object projecting onto life-like
features, think robotics generally sees negative, see superpower. Like
that, need use that. - Well, struck really grabs onto relationship

00:47:37 Robots Change Us



human machine, human robot. So, guess simple question is,
think already told us answer, interacting robot change
you? words, develop relationships robots? - Yeah, definitely think so.
think moment see robot AI systems just servants entities,
begin change you, just like good friends do, just like relationships just
humans. think that, certain aspects interaction. Like
robot's ability say no, sense identity, set goals,
not constantly serving you, instead, trying understand world
dance understanding communication you. So, definitely think a,
mean, lot thoughts may know, core
life-long dream actually want do, believe people
notion loneliness haven't discovered, haven't explored,
say. see AI systems helping us explore can become
better humans, better people towards other. So, think connection
human AI, human robot, not possible, will help us understand
ways like several orders magnitude deeper ever
imagined. tend believe [sighing]

00:49:35 Relationships Defined

well, wild levels belief terms impactful will be, right? - So,
think human relationships, don't always break variables,
explore variables see map human-robot
relationships. One just time, right? spend zero time another person
cyberspace phone person, essentially no relationship them.
spend lot time, relationship, obvious. guess one variable
time, much time spend entity, robot human.
wins successes. enjoy successes together. give absolutely
trivial example moment, failures. struggle
somebody, whether not struggle one another, disagree, like
really struck fact said robot saying no, never thought
robot saying no me, is. - look forward one first people
send robots to. - I. So, struggle. struggle somebody,


grow closer. Sometimes struggles imposed two people,
called trauma bonding, call whole psychology literature pop psychology
literature. case, can imagine. So, time successes together, struggle together,
just peaceful time, hanging home, watching movies, waking near one
another, here, breaking elements relationships kind. So,
think elements apply robot-human relationships? so, see
how, robot entity autonomy terms reacts
you, not just just serve you, not just servant, actually opinions,
can tell maybe thinking flawed, actions flawed. - can
also leave. - also leave. So, never conceptualized robot-human interactions
way. So, tell might look. thinking human-
appearing robot? know intense relationships our,
separate dogs obviously, animals, sounds lot like human-animal interaction.
So, ideal human-robot relationship? - So, lot said here,
actually pinpointed one big, big first steps, idea time.
huge limitation machine-learning community currently. Now back like
actual details. Life-long learning problem space focuses AI systems can
learn long period time. currently machine learning systems not
able do, things listed time, successes, failures,
just chilling together watching movies, AI systems not able that,
beautiful, magical moments believe days filled with, not able keep
track together you. - 'Cause can't move you. -
No, no, like literally don't techniques learning, actual learning
containing moments. Current machine-learning systems really focused
understanding world following way, like perception system, like
looking around, understand like scene. bunch people
sitting down, cameras microphones, table, understand
that. fact shared moment talking today, still remember
like next time something, remember moment happened. don't
know technique-wise. hoping innovate think
very, important component means create deeper relationship,
sharing moments together. - post photo robot, like selfie
robot robot sees image recognizes time spent,
smiles, tears- - Yeah. - create sort metric emotional depth


relationship update behavior? - So. - it... texts middle
night say, haven't texted back? - Well, yes, things,
can dig that. think time element, forget everything else, just sharing
moments together, changes everything. believe changes everything. Now,
specific things terms systems can explain you.
technical probably little bit offline, 'cause kind wild ideas can
revolutionize social networks operating systems. point element alone,
forget things talking like emotions, saying no, that, just
remembering sharing moments together change everything. don't currently
systems share moments together. Like even just fridge, just
times, went late night ate thing shouldn't eaten,
secret moment refrigerator. shared moment, darkness
beautiful moment just like heartbroken reason,
eating ice cream whatever, special moment. refrigerator
you, fact missed opportunity remember tragic.
remember that, think going attached refrigerator.
going go hell refrigerator. us have, like
developed world, weird relationships food, right? So, can go
deep moments trauma triumph food, core that,
refrigerator. So, smart refrigerator, believe change society. Not just
refrigerator, ideas systems around us. So, just want comment
powerful idea time is. bunch elements actual
interaction allowing human feel like heard. Truly heard, truly
understood, human, like deep friendship like that, think, still
element selfishness, still element not really able understand
another human. lot times going trauma together,
difficult times successes, actually starting get inkling
understanding other, think done aggressively,
efficiently. Like think great therapist, think never actually
therapist, believer used want psychiatrist. - Russians go
therapists? - No, don't. don't. do, therapist don't live tell
story. believe talk therapy, friendship me, talk therapy, like
don't even necessarily need talk [laughing] like just connecting
space ideas space experiences. think lot ideas


make AI systems able ask right questions truly hear another human.
try podcasting, right? think ways AI.
else, just remembering collection moments make day,
week, months, think maybe well. closest
friends still friends high school. time, bunch
together, like different people. just fact
that, remember moments, moments somehow create
depth connection like nothing else, like refrigerator. - love
graduate advisor, unfortunately, passed away, passed away,
somebody said memorial amazing things done, et cetera.
kids got there, young children knew
pregnant them. so, really, even now can feel like heart
gets heavy, thinking this, going grow without mother.
really amazing, strong young girls, now young women. said
incredible, said really appreciated mother,
amazing person, unstructured time spent together. - Mm-hmm. - So,
wasn't trips zoo, wasn't woke five morning drove us
school. things too. two hour commute direction,
incredible, ran lab, et cetera, unstructured time. So, passing
mother, remembered biggest give bonded
her, time just kind hung out. way describe
relationship refrigerator so, want say human-like, almost reluctant
say that. realizing talking, think
human-like might actually lower form relationship. may relationships
far better sorts relationships can conceive minds right
now based machine relationship interactions teach us.
right? - Yeah, think so. think no reason see machines somehow
incapable teaching us something deeply human. don't think humans
monopoly that. think understand poorly need
kind prompting machine. definitely part that, just remembering
moments. think unstructured time together, wonder quite unstructured.
like calling podcast structured time. - Maybe meant,
wasn't big outing, no specific goal, goal created lack
goal. Like just hang start playing, thumb war,


end playing thumb war hour. So, structure emerges lack
structure. - No, thing moments, something times
creates special moments, think optimized for. think think like
big outing as, don't know, going Six Flags something, big, Grand
Canyon, go some, don't know, think need to, don't quite yet
understand, humans, creates magical moments. think possible optimize
lot things. perhaps like podcasting helping people discover that, like
maybe thing want optimize isn't necessarily like sexy, like quick clips,
maybe want, long-form authenticity. - Depth. - Depth. So, trying
figure out, certainly deep connection humans humans NAS
systems, think long conversations, long periods communication series
moments like new, perhaps, seemingly insignificant big ones, big
successes, big failures, just stitching together talking
throughout. think formula really, really deep connection. like
specific engineering perspective, think fascinating open problem
really worked much. me, a, guts

01:02:29 Lex’s Dream Humanity

and, mean lot things say, one guts, build startup around
it. - So, talk startup talk dream. mentioned
dream previous conversations, always little hints dropped
there. Just anyone listening, never offline conversation
dream, not privy anything, except Lex says now. realized
no way capture full essence dream kind verbal statement way
captures it. dream referred now several times
sat together talked phone? Maybe company,
maybe something distinct. feel comfortable, it'd great share
little bit is. - Sure. So, way people express long-term vision,
noticed quite different. Like Elon example somebody can crisply say
exactly goal is. Also fact problems solving
nothing humans. So, long-term vision little bit difficult express
words, noticed, tried, brain's failure, way
sneak it. So, let just say things. Early life also recent


years, interacted robots understood magic there.
magic shared millions brought light. first met Spot
Boston Dynamics, realized magic nobody else seeing. - dog.
- dog, sorry. Spot four-legged robot Boston Dynamics. people
might seen it, yellow dog. sometimes life, just notice something
just grabs you. believe something magic something
every single device world. way think maybe Steve Jobs
thought personal computer, laws didn't think personal computer
way, Steve did. like, thought personal computer
thin sheet paper everybody one, idea, think
heartbreaking getting, world filled machines
soulless. think every one can magic. One things
also inspired terms startup, magic can engineered much easier
thought. intuition everything ever built worked on. So, dream
add bit magic every single computing system world. So, way
Windows Operating System long time primary operating system
everybody interacted with, built apps top it. think something
layer, almost operating system every device humans
interacted world. Now, actually looks like, actual dream
officially kid, didn't concrete form business, dream
exploring loneliness interacting machines, robots. deep
connection humans robots always dream. so, me, love
see world every home robot, not robot washes
dishes, sex robot, don't know, think kind activity robot can do,
like companion. - family member. - family member, way dog is. - Mm-
hmm. - dog able speak language too. So, not just connect way
dog looking looking away almost like smiling soul
kind way, also actually understand hell, like, excited
successes? Like understand details, understand traumas. that,
just think [sighing] always filled excitement could, artificial
intelligence, bring joy lot people. recently,
heartbroken see kind division, derision, even hate boiling
internet social networks. thought kind mechanism exactly
applicable context social networks well. So, operating system


serves guide internet. One biggest problems YouTube
social networks currently, optimizing engagement. think create AI
systems know individual person, able optimize long-term growth
long-term happiness. - individual, or- - individual, individual.
lot things say, order AI systems learn
everything you, need collect, need just like talk
offline, collecting data others secrets other, way
AI that. allows to, requires rethink ideas
ownership data. think individual data easily
able leave just like AI systems can leave, humans can disappear delete
data moment's notice. actually better humans can do,
load data other, there. think important both, give people
complete control data order establish trust can trust you.
second part trust transparency. Whenever data used make clear
used for. not clear lawyerly legal sense, clear way
people really understand used for. believe people ability
delete data walk away know data used, think
stay. - possibility clean breakup, actually will keep people together. -
Yeah, think so. think, exactly. think happy marriage acquires ability divorce
easily without divorce industrial complex whatever. Things currently going
much money made lawyers divorce. yeah, ability
leave enables love, think. - interesting. heard phrase semi-
cynical friend, marriage leading cause divorce, now heard
divorce, possibility divorce leading cause marriage. - happy
marriage. - Good point. - happy marriage. So, yeah. So, lot details
there, big dream connection AI system human.
haven't. much fear artificial intelligence systems robots
haven't quite found right words express vision vision have,
not like naive, delusional vision like technology going save everybody,
really just positive view ways AI systems can help humans explore
themselves. - love positivity agree stance everything doomed
equally bad say everything's going turn right, dedicated
effort. clearly, thinking dedicated effort look like.
mentioned two aspects dream [clears throat] want make sure


understand connect do, independent streams. One
hypothetical robot family member, form robot allow
people experience kind delight experienced many times,

01:11:33 Improving Social Media

like world able have, beautiful idea
give. social media social network platforms really serve
individuals best selves happiness growth. crossover
those, two parallel dreams? - 100% thing.
difficult kind explain without going details, maybe one easy way
explain way think social networks, create AI system yours.
not like Amazon Alexa centralized, data, like little friend
becomes representative Twitter helps find things will make feel
good, will also challenge thinking make grow, not get that, not let
get lost negative spiral dopamine, gets angry, just
get not open learning. so, little representative optimizing
long-term health. believe not good human beings, also good
business. think longterm, can make lot money challenging idea
way make money, maximizing engagement. one things
people disagree on, think Twitter's always going win. Like maximizing
engagement always going win, don't think so. think people woken now
understanding that, like don't always feel good, ones Twitter lot,
don't always feel good end week. - love feedback
whatever creature, whatever, don't know call it, maybe end
week, automatically unfollow people follow
realized really smart data feeling inside,
sleeping, something that, don't know, just wasn't good me. might also
put things people front see, kind sliver
look like? - whole point, interaction, sharing moments
learning lot you, now able understand interactions led
become better version yourself. Like person happy with.
isn't, flat earth feel good it, believe earth
flat, like idea sensor ridiculous. makes feel good


becoming best version yourself, think getting much flat
earth possible. Now, also good challenge ideas, not
centralized committee decided, tell system like
challenging ideas, think us do. then, actually YouTube doesn't
well, go flat-earth rabbit hole, going see.
nice get really powerful communicators argue flat earth. nice
see you, potentially, least long-term expand horizons, maybe
earth not flat. continue live whole life thinking earth flat,
think, good father son daughter, like best
version happy yourself, think earth flat. So, like think
kind idea, just using kind silly, ridiculous example don't
like idea centralized forces controlling can can't see, also don't
like idea like not censoring anything. always biggest problem
that, central decider, think can decide want
see not, good companion reminds felt last time
this, felt good last time this. - Man, feel like every good story,
guide companion flies out, forges little bit further, little bit
differently brings back information helps us, least tries steer us
right direction. - So, yeah, exactly thinking working on.
mention bunch difficulties here, see little bit
recently. So, technically lot challenges here. Just like lot
technologies, reason talking podcast comfortably opposed
working secret, really hard maybe time not come.
something constantly struggle terms like entrepreneurially
startup, like also mentioned you, maybe offline, really don't care money,

01:16:57 Challenges Creativity

don't care business success, kinds things. So, difficult decision
make, much time want go give everything
this? big roll dice. also realized working
problems, robotics technical side terms machine-learning
system describing, lonely, really lonely. personal level
technical level. So, technical level, surrounded people kind


doubt me, think entrepreneurs go through. doubt following
sense, know difficult is. Like people colleagues mine,
know difficult life-long learning is, also know difficult build system
like this, build competitive social network. general, kind
loneliness just working something long periods time.
start doubt whether, given don't track record success, like
big one. look mirror, especially young, still
that, things, look mirror, like, big dreams,
know actually smart think are? Like know
going able accomplish dream? ambition. - sort don't,
kind pulling string hoping bigger ball yarn. - Yeah.
[Andrew laughing] kind intuition. think pride knowing
good at, reason intuition, 'cause think good
knowing things suck at, basically everything. So, like whenever
notice like, wait minute, kind good this, rare me. think like
that, might ball yarn worth pulling at. thing terms
engineering systems able interact humans, think good that.
talk podcasting on, don't know good
podcasts. - good podcasting, right? - certainly don't, think maybe
compelling people watch kindhearted idiot struggle form, maybe
compelling. terms like actual good engineer human-robot
interaction systems, think good. hard know it,
world keeps telling not, full doll, really hard.
struggling recently, kind fascinating struggle.
Goggins thing comes in, like, aside state-hard motherfucker, the, like
whenever struggling, good sign keep going, going
alone success, right? - Well, case, however, agree. actually David
post recently thought among many brilliant posts, one
brilliant talked myth light end tunnel.
instead, replaced myth with, concept eventually, eyes
adapt dark. tunnel, not light end, really
adapting dark tunnel. Goggins- - love much. - Yeah.
got share lot common knowing bit, share lot common.
loneliness pursuit dream, seems me, certain component


extremely valuable, loneliness serve driver
build companion journey. - Well, deeply aware that. So, like
people can make, 'cause talk love lot, really love everything world,
also love humans, friendship romantic, like even cheesy stuff, just- - like
romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, got much Rogan
like, Tango scene "Scent Woman,"

01:21:49 Suits & Dresses

find like nothing better woman red dress, just like classy- -
move Argentina friend. father's Argentine, know
said went podcast first time? said, dresses well.
Argentina, men go wedding party something, U.S., halfway
night, 10 minutes night, jackets off. - Yeah. - looks like
everyone's undressing party just got dressed for. said, know,
liked way dresses. started, talking you.
started podcast, said, don't wear real suit like friend Lex?

01:22:22 Loneliness

[laughing] - remember that. - No, can't. talk pursuit just bit
more, think talking about, building a, not just solution
loneliness, alluded loneliness itself, important thing. think
right. think within people, like caverns faults shame, also just
desire resonance, seen heard. don't even know seen
heard language. reservoirs loneliness, think, well,
interesting, maybe comment little bit it. just often
talk love, haven't quantified it, seems talk loneliness,
maybe just willing, share little bit that,
feels like now pursuit building robot-human relationship. been,
let direct, spending lot time building robot-human
relationship, at? - Oh, terms business, terms systems? - No,
talking specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, mention things.
So, one, startup idea hope millions people can use.


personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going

me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know

ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]

Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like

time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now

kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

even mean. seems lot splitting happening now not just
supervised unsupervised learning, sort intermediate conditions
machines autonomous, go back instruction like kids go home
college summer get little, moms still feeds eventually
leave nest kind thing. something particular engineers,
people realm engineering think lends disagreement? - Yeah,
think, so, first all, specific get, less disagreement is.
lot disagreement artificial intelligence, less disagreement
machine learning even less talk active learning
machine teaching self-supervised learning. get like NLP
language models transformers, get specific neural network
architectures, less less less disagreement terms.
might hearing disagreement high-level terms,
fact engineering, especially talking intelligence systems little
bit art science. art part thing creates disagreements,
start disagreements easy difficult particular
problem is. example, lot people disagree Elon difficult problem
autonomous driving is. so, nobody knows. lot disagreement
about, limits techniques? that, terminology also
contains within disagreements. overall, think also young science
also that. like not just engineering, artificial intelligence truly
large-scale discipline, thousands, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands people working it, huge amounts money made recent
thing. trying figure terms. And, course, egos
personalities lot fame made. Like term deep learning, example,
neural networks around many, many decades since '60s, can
argue since '40s. rebranding neural networks word, deep
learning, term, deep learning, part re-invigoration field,
really exact thing. - didn't know that. mean, grew age
neuroscience neural networks discussed, computational neuroscience
theoretical neuroscience, journals. wasn't actually taken terribly
seriously experimentalists years ago. say five seven years
ago. Excellent theoretical neuroscientist like Larry Abbott colleagues, certainly
Stanford well people started paying attention computational methods.


terms, neural networks, computational methods, actually didn't know neural
network works deep learning now become kind synonymous. -
No, always thing. - Interesting. was, so. - neuroscientist
didn't know that. - So, well, neural networks probably means something else
neural science not something else, little different flavor depending field.
fascinating too, neuroscience AI people started working
together dancing lot recent,

00:26:46 Machine & Human Learning

say probably decade. - Oh, machines going brain. couple
questions, one thing sort fixated find incredibly interesting
example gave playing game mutated version competitor.
- Yeah. - find incredibly interesting kind parallel mirror
happens try learn humans, generate repetitions
whatever trying learn, make errors. Occasionally succeed.
simple example, instance, trying throw bulls eyes dartboard. - Yeah. -
going errors, errors, errors. probably miss dartboard. maybe
occasionally, hit bullseye. don't know exactly just did, right?
say playing darts version wearing visual prism,
like visual, visual defect, learn certain things mode well.
saying machine can sort mutate itself, mutation always cause
deficiency needs overcome? mutations biology sometimes give
us super powers, right? Occasionally, get somebody better 2020
vision, can see better 99.9% people there. So, talk
machine playing game mutated version itself, mutation always say
call negative mutation, adaptive maladaptive mutation? - No,
don't know get, so, mutate first figure compete
other. - So, evolving, machine gets evolve real time. -
Yeah. think it, exciting actually humans.
not just. So, usually freeze version system. So, really take Andrew
yesterday make 10 clones them. maybe mutate, maybe not.
bunch competitions Andrew today, like fight
death, wins last. So, love idea like creating bunch clones


like day past year, just seeing going better
like podcasting science, picking chicks bar don't know, competing
Jujitsu. one way it, mean, lot Lexes die
process, essentially happens, reinforcement learning
self-play mechanisms, graveyard systems didn't well.
surviving, good ones survive. - think that, mean, Darwin's Theory
Evolution might worked sense way, population level.
mean, get bunch birds different shaped beaks birds
shaped beak allows get seeds. mean, trivially simple example
Darwinian evolution, think correct even though not exhaustive.
referring to? essentially normally done members
different species, lots different members species different traits get
selected for, actually create multiple versions different
traits. - So, with, probably said this, perhaps implied machine
learning, reinforcement learning processes. One big
requirements, objective function, loss function, utility function,
different terms thing, like equation says good,
trying optimize equation. So, clear goal
systems. - game, like chess, goal. - anything.
Anything want machine learning solve, needs objective function.
machine learning, usually called Loss Function, optimizing.
interesting thing evolution, complicated course, goal also seems
evolving. Like a, guess, adaptation environment, goal,
unclear can convert always. like survival fittest. unclear
fittest is. machine learning, starting point, like human ingenuity
provides, fitness function good bad, lets know
systems going win. So, need equation like that. One
fascinating things humans, figure objective functions ourselves.
Like meaning life, like hell here? machine currently
hard-coded statement why. - meaning of- - Yeah. -
Artificial intelligence-based life. - Right. can't. So, like lot interesting
explorations function curiosity, learning new things
kind stuff, still hard coded. want machine able
good stuff, given clear statements good stuff means.


one challenges artificial intelligence, formalize the, order
solve problem, formalize provide like full
sensory information, clear data
collected, also clear objective function.

00:32:21 Curiosity

goal trying reach? difficult thing artificial
intelligence. - love mentioned curiosity, sure definition falls short
many ways, define curiosity strong interest knowing something, without
attachment outcome. sort a, random search, not
really emotional attachment, really just desire discover unveil
without hoping gold coin rock, just looking rocks.
less the, within machine learning, sounds like elements
reward prediction rewards. machine know done right thing.
So, can make machines curious, sorts machines
describing, curious design? - Yeah, curiosity kind symptom, not goal. So,
happens, one big trade-offs reinforcement learning, exploration
versus exploitation. So, know little, pays off explore lot, even
suboptimal, like even trajectories seem like not going lead anywhere,
called exploration. smarter smarter smarter get,
emphasis put exploitation, meaning take best solution, take best
path. Now, process, exploration can look like curiosity us humans,
really just trying get local optimal, thing already discovered.
AI perspective, always looking optimize objective function, derives,
can talk slot more, terms tools machine learning today,
derives no pleasure just curiosity like, don't know, discovery. - So,
no dopamine machine learning. - no dopamine. - no reward, system
chemical, guess electronic-reward system. - said, look machine
learning literature reinforcement learning literature, will use, like deep mind,
use terms like dopamine, constantly trying use human brain inspire totally
new solutions problems. So, think like, dopamine function
human brain, can lead interesting ways discover optimal
solutions? ultimately currently, formal objective function. Now,


argue humans also set objective functions try optimize,
just not able introspect them. - Yeah, don't actually know looking
seeking doing. - Well, like Lisa Feldman Barrett spoken least
Instagram, hope you- - met you, yeah. - Yeah, hope actually
podcast. - Yes, terrific. - So, very,
homeostasis like that. Basically, dumb objective function brain
trying optimize, like keep like body temperature same. Like dom
kind optimization function happening. humans fancy
consciousness cognitive abilities, tell stories can nice
podcasts, really brain trying maintain a, just like healthy state, guess.
fascinating. also see human brain, hope artificial intelligence systems,
not just systems solve problems, optimize goal, also storytellers.
think power telling stories. tell stories other,
communication is. Like alone, solve problems,
makes sense talk solving problems. community,
capability communicate, tell stories, share ideas way ideas
stable long period time, like, charismatic storyteller.
think humans good this. Arguably, argue
are, great storytellers. AI hope will also become that. So, not
just able solve problems clear objective function,

00:36:55 Story Telling Robots

afterwards, able tell like way better, like make way better story
something, failed. - So, think robots or, and/or
machines sort going start telling human stories? - Well, definitely. So,
technical field called Explainable AI, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, trying
figure get AI system explain us humans hell failed,
succeeded, lot different sort versions this, visualize
understands world. really difficult problem, especially neural networks
famously opaque, don't understand many cases, particular
neural network well, try figure going fail,
requires AI explain itself. huge amount money, like huge
amount money this, especially government funding on.


want deploy AI systems real world, humans least, want ask
question like, hell that? Like dark way, just kill
person, right? Like car ran person, want understand happened.
now again, sometimes unfair AI systems humans can
often not explain well. field Explainable AI people
interested rely AI systems, like Twitter
recommender system, AI algorithm that's, say impacting elections, perhaps
starting wars, least military conflict, algorithm, want ask algorithm,
first all, know hell doing? understand society-level
effects having? can explain possible trajectories? Like
kind conversation human, want able
AI. personal level, think nice talk AI systems stupid
stuff, like robots fail to- - Why'd fall stairs? - Yeah. not
engineering question, almost like endearing question, like looking for, fell
hanging out, don't think need explanation exactly
dynamics, like actuated system problem here? Like
texture floor? on. like, the- - No, want know
thinking. - That, might joke like, drunk again, go home, something,
like humor it, opportunity. Like storytelling, isn't just
explanation happened, something makes people laugh, makes people
fall love, makes people dream, understand things way poetry makes
people understand things opposed rigorous log every sensor was,
every actuator was. - mean, find incredible one hallmarks
severe autism spectrum disorders is, report experience autistic person
much catalog action steps. like, feel today? say,
well, got this, this, this. not way
person doesn't autism spectrum disorder respond. way
describe machines much humanism,

00:40:48 Defines Robot?

much human biological element, realized talking
machines. want make sure understand distinction
machine learns, machine artificial intelligence robot. Like point


machine become robot? So, ballpoint pen, assuming wouldn't
call robot, ballpoint pen can come moved opposite
side table, moves whatever mechanism, point, become
robot? - Okay, 1 million ways explore question. fascinating one. So,
first all, question life? Like know something living
form not? question sort a, maybe cold
computational system becomes a, already loading words lot meaning,
robot machine, So, one, think movement important, kind boring
idea robot just machine able act world. So, one artificial
intelligence just thinking thing, think machine learning
is, also acting thing, usually think robots. So, robots
things perception system able take world however
define world, able think learn whatever hell inside,
act world. So, difference maybe AI system learning
machine robot, something able, robot something able
perceive world act world. - So, language sound,
movement both. - Yeah. think also digital
space long aspect entity inside machine world
outside machine. sense machine sensing world
acting it. - So, could, instance, version robot, according
definition think providing, robot, go sleep night
robot goes forges information thinks want see loaded onto
desktop morning. no movement machine, no
language, essentially, movement cyberspace. - Yeah, distinction
think important element entity, whether
digital physical space. So, something like Alexa home,
speech recognition, Alexa doing, constantly sent
back mothership. Alexa own, me, robot,
interacting world. simply finger main mothership,
Alexa not robot, just interaction device, may main
Amazon Alexa AI, big, big system robot. So, important
element, us humans, think, want entity, whether
digital physical space, ideas consciousness come
kinds things project understanding means being.



00:44:30 Magic & Surprise

so, take further, machine become robot, think
special moment. special moment person's life robot's life
surprises you. think surprise really powerful thing, know thing
works yet surprises you, magical moment us humans. So, whether
chess-playing program something haven't seen before, makes
people smile like, huh, moments happen AlphaZero first time chess
playing, grand masters really surprised move. didn't understand
move studied studied understood it.
moment surprise, grandmasters chess. find moment surprise
really powerful, really magical just everyday life. - supersedes human
brain moment? - So, not supersedes, like outperforms, surprises
positive sense. Like didn't think that, didn't think you.
think moment big transition robot moment servant
accomplishes particular task level accuracy, rate
failure, entity, struggling just like world.
really important moment think not going find many people AI
community talk like just did. not speaking like philosopher hippie,
speaking purely engineering perspective. think really important robots
become entities explore real engineering problem, opposed
everybody treats robots robotics community, don't even call
she, don't give them, try avoid giving names, really want see like
system, like servant. see servant trying accomplish task.
me, don't think just romanticizing notion, think being, currently
perhaps dumb being, long arc history, humans pretty dumb beings
too, so- - agree statement. [Andrew laughing] - So, tend really want
explore treating robots really entities, yeah. So, like anthropomorphization,
sort act looking inanimate object projecting onto life-like
features, think robotics generally sees negative, see superpower. Like
that, need use that. - Well, struck really grabs onto relationship

00:47:37 Robots Change Us



human machine, human robot. So, guess simple question is,
think already told us answer, interacting robot change
you? words, develop relationships robots? - Yeah, definitely think so.
think moment see robot AI systems just servants entities,
begin change you, just like good friends do, just like relationships just
humans. think that, certain aspects interaction. Like
robot's ability say no, sense identity, set goals,
not constantly serving you, instead, trying understand world
dance understanding communication you. So, definitely think a,
mean, lot thoughts may know, core
life-long dream actually want do, believe people
notion loneliness haven't discovered, haven't explored,
say. see AI systems helping us explore can become
better humans, better people towards other. So, think connection
human AI, human robot, not possible, will help us understand
ways like several orders magnitude deeper ever
imagined. tend believe [sighing]

00:49:35 Relationships Defined

well, wild levels belief terms impactful will be, right? - So,
think human relationships, don't always break variables,
explore variables see map human-robot
relationships. One just time, right? spend zero time another person
cyberspace phone person, essentially no relationship them.
spend lot time, relationship, obvious. guess one variable
time, much time spend entity, robot human.
wins successes. enjoy successes together. give absolutely
trivial example moment, failures. struggle
somebody, whether not struggle one another, disagree, like
really struck fact said robot saying no, never thought
robot saying no me, is. - look forward one first people
send robots to. - I. So, struggle. struggle somebody,


grow closer. Sometimes struggles imposed two people,
called trauma bonding, call whole psychology literature pop psychology
literature. case, can imagine. So, time successes together, struggle together,
just peaceful time, hanging home, watching movies, waking near one
another, here, breaking elements relationships kind. So,
think elements apply robot-human relationships? so, see
how, robot entity autonomy terms reacts
you, not just just serve you, not just servant, actually opinions,
can tell maybe thinking flawed, actions flawed. - can
also leave. - also leave. So, never conceptualized robot-human interactions
way. So, tell might look. thinking human-
appearing robot? know intense relationships our,
separate dogs obviously, animals, sounds lot like human-animal interaction.
So, ideal human-robot relationship? - So, lot said here,
actually pinpointed one big, big first steps, idea time.
huge limitation machine-learning community currently. Now back like
actual details. Life-long learning problem space focuses AI systems can
learn long period time. currently machine learning systems not
able do, things listed time, successes, failures,
just chilling together watching movies, AI systems not able that,
beautiful, magical moments believe days filled with, not able keep
track together you. - 'Cause can't move you. -
No, no, like literally don't techniques learning, actual learning
containing moments. Current machine-learning systems really focused
understanding world following way, like perception system, like
looking around, understand like scene. bunch people
sitting down, cameras microphones, table, understand
that. fact shared moment talking today, still remember
like next time something, remember moment happened. don't
know technique-wise. hoping innovate think
very, important component means create deeper relationship,
sharing moments together. - post photo robot, like selfie
robot robot sees image recognizes time spent,
smiles, tears- - Yeah. - create sort metric emotional depth


relationship update behavior? - So. - it... texts middle
night say, haven't texted back? - Well, yes, things,
can dig that. think time element, forget everything else, just sharing
moments together, changes everything. believe changes everything. Now,
specific things terms systems can explain you.
technical probably little bit offline, 'cause kind wild ideas can
revolutionize social networks operating systems. point element alone,
forget things talking like emotions, saying no, that, just
remembering sharing moments together change everything. don't currently
systems share moments together. Like even just fridge, just
times, went late night ate thing shouldn't eaten,
secret moment refrigerator. shared moment, darkness
beautiful moment just like heartbroken reason,
eating ice cream whatever, special moment. refrigerator
you, fact missed opportunity remember tragic.
remember that, think going attached refrigerator.
going go hell refrigerator. us have, like
developed world, weird relationships food, right? So, can go
deep moments trauma triumph food, core that,
refrigerator. So, smart refrigerator, believe change society. Not just
refrigerator, ideas systems around us. So, just want comment
powerful idea time is. bunch elements actual
interaction allowing human feel like heard. Truly heard, truly
understood, human, like deep friendship like that, think, still
element selfishness, still element not really able understand
another human. lot times going trauma together,
difficult times successes, actually starting get inkling
understanding other, think done aggressively,
efficiently. Like think great therapist, think never actually
therapist, believer used want psychiatrist. - Russians go
therapists? - No, don't. don't. do, therapist don't live tell
story. believe talk therapy, friendship me, talk therapy, like
don't even necessarily need talk [laughing] like just connecting
space ideas space experiences. think lot ideas


make AI systems able ask right questions truly hear another human.
try podcasting, right? think ways AI.
else, just remembering collection moments make day,
week, months, think maybe well. closest
friends still friends high school. time, bunch
together, like different people. just fact
that, remember moments, moments somehow create
depth connection like nothing else, like refrigerator. - love
graduate advisor, unfortunately, passed away, passed away,
somebody said memorial amazing things done, et cetera.
kids got there, young children knew
pregnant them. so, really, even now can feel like heart
gets heavy, thinking this, going grow without mother.
really amazing, strong young girls, now young women. said
incredible, said really appreciated mother,
amazing person, unstructured time spent together. - Mm-hmm. - So,
wasn't trips zoo, wasn't woke five morning drove us
school. things too. two hour commute direction,
incredible, ran lab, et cetera, unstructured time. So, passing
mother, remembered biggest give bonded
her, time just kind hung out. way describe
relationship refrigerator so, want say human-like, almost reluctant
say that. realizing talking, think
human-like might actually lower form relationship. may relationships
far better sorts relationships can conceive minds right
now based machine relationship interactions teach us.
right? - Yeah, think so. think no reason see machines somehow
incapable teaching us something deeply human. don't think humans
monopoly that. think understand poorly need
kind prompting machine. definitely part that, just remembering
moments. think unstructured time together, wonder quite unstructured.
like calling podcast structured time. - Maybe meant,
wasn't big outing, no specific goal, goal created lack
goal. Like just hang start playing, thumb war,


end playing thumb war hour. So, structure emerges lack
structure. - No, thing moments, something times
creates special moments, think optimized for. think think like
big outing as, don't know, going Six Flags something, big, Grand
Canyon, go some, don't know, think need to, don't quite yet
understand, humans, creates magical moments. think possible optimize
lot things. perhaps like podcasting helping people discover that, like
maybe thing want optimize isn't necessarily like sexy, like quick clips,
maybe want, long-form authenticity. - Depth. - Depth. So, trying
figure out, certainly deep connection humans humans NAS
systems, think long conversations, long periods communication series
moments like new, perhaps, seemingly insignificant big ones, big
successes, big failures, just stitching together talking
throughout. think formula really, really deep connection. like
specific engineering perspective, think fascinating open problem
really worked much. me, a, guts

01:02:29 Lex’s Dream Humanity

and, mean lot things say, one guts, build startup around
it. - So, talk startup talk dream. mentioned
dream previous conversations, always little hints dropped
there. Just anyone listening, never offline conversation
dream, not privy anything, except Lex says now. realized
no way capture full essence dream kind verbal statement way
captures it. dream referred now several times
sat together talked phone? Maybe company,
maybe something distinct. feel comfortable, it'd great share
little bit is. - Sure. So, way people express long-term vision,
noticed quite different. Like Elon example somebody can crisply say
exactly goal is. Also fact problems solving
nothing humans. So, long-term vision little bit difficult express
words, noticed, tried, brain's failure, way
sneak it. So, let just say things. Early life also recent


years, interacted robots understood magic there.
magic shared millions brought light. first met Spot
Boston Dynamics, realized magic nobody else seeing. - dog.
- dog, sorry. Spot four-legged robot Boston Dynamics. people
might seen it, yellow dog. sometimes life, just notice something
just grabs you. believe something magic something
every single device world. way think maybe Steve Jobs
thought personal computer, laws didn't think personal computer
way, Steve did. like, thought personal computer
thin sheet paper everybody one, idea, think
heartbreaking getting, world filled machines
soulless. think every one can magic. One things
also inspired terms startup, magic can engineered much easier
thought. intuition everything ever built worked on. So, dream
add bit magic every single computing system world. So, way
Windows Operating System long time primary operating system
everybody interacted with, built apps top it. think something
layer, almost operating system every device humans
interacted world. Now, actually looks like, actual dream
officially kid, didn't concrete form business, dream
exploring loneliness interacting machines, robots. deep
connection humans robots always dream. so, me, love
see world every home robot, not robot washes
dishes, sex robot, don't know, think kind activity robot can do,
like companion. - family member. - family member, way dog is. - Mm-
hmm. - dog able speak language too. So, not just connect way
dog looking looking away almost like smiling soul
kind way, also actually understand hell, like, excited
successes? Like understand details, understand traumas. that,
just think [sighing] always filled excitement could, artificial
intelligence, bring joy lot people. recently,
heartbroken see kind division, derision, even hate boiling
internet social networks. thought kind mechanism exactly
applicable context social networks well. So, operating system


serves guide internet. One biggest problems YouTube
social networks currently, optimizing engagement. think create AI
systems know individual person, able optimize long-term growth
long-term happiness. - individual, or- - individual, individual.
lot things say, order AI systems learn
everything you, need collect, need just like talk
offline, collecting data others secrets other, way
AI that. allows to, requires rethink ideas
ownership data. think individual data easily
able leave just like AI systems can leave, humans can disappear delete
data moment's notice. actually better humans can do,
load data other, there. think important both, give people
complete control data order establish trust can trust you.
second part trust transparency. Whenever data used make clear
used for. not clear lawyerly legal sense, clear way
people really understand used for. believe people ability
delete data walk away know data used, think
stay. - possibility clean breakup, actually will keep people together. -
Yeah, think so. think, exactly. think happy marriage acquires ability divorce
easily without divorce industrial complex whatever. Things currently going
much money made lawyers divorce. yeah, ability
leave enables love, think. - interesting. heard phrase semi-
cynical friend, marriage leading cause divorce, now heard
divorce, possibility divorce leading cause marriage. - happy
marriage. - Good point. - happy marriage. So, yeah. So, lot details
there, big dream connection AI system human.
haven't. much fear artificial intelligence systems robots
haven't quite found right words express vision vision have,
not like naive, delusional vision like technology going save everybody,
really just positive view ways AI systems can help humans explore
themselves. - love positivity agree stance everything doomed
equally bad say everything's going turn right, dedicated
effort. clearly, thinking dedicated effort look like.
mentioned two aspects dream [clears throat] want make sure


understand connect do, independent streams. One
hypothetical robot family member, form robot allow
people experience kind delight experienced many times,

01:11:33 Improving Social Media

like world able have, beautiful idea
give. social media social network platforms really serve
individuals best selves happiness growth. crossover
those, two parallel dreams? - 100% thing.
difficult kind explain without going details, maybe one easy way
explain way think social networks, create AI system yours.
not like Amazon Alexa centralized, data, like little friend
becomes representative Twitter helps find things will make feel
good, will also challenge thinking make grow, not get that, not let
get lost negative spiral dopamine, gets angry, just
get not open learning. so, little representative optimizing
long-term health. believe not good human beings, also good
business. think longterm, can make lot money challenging idea
way make money, maximizing engagement. one things
people disagree on, think Twitter's always going win. Like maximizing
engagement always going win, don't think so. think people woken now
understanding that, like don't always feel good, ones Twitter lot,
don't always feel good end week. - love feedback
whatever creature, whatever, don't know call it, maybe end
week, automatically unfollow people follow
realized really smart data feeling inside,
sleeping, something that, don't know, just wasn't good me. might also
put things people front see, kind sliver
look like? - whole point, interaction, sharing moments
learning lot you, now able understand interactions led
become better version yourself. Like person happy with.
isn't, flat earth feel good it, believe earth
flat, like idea sensor ridiculous. makes feel good


becoming best version yourself, think getting much flat
earth possible. Now, also good challenge ideas, not
centralized committee decided, tell system like
challenging ideas, think us do. then, actually YouTube doesn't
well, go flat-earth rabbit hole, going see.
nice get really powerful communicators argue flat earth. nice
see you, potentially, least long-term expand horizons, maybe
earth not flat. continue live whole life thinking earth flat,
think, good father son daughter, like best
version happy yourself, think earth flat. So, like think
kind idea, just using kind silly, ridiculous example don't
like idea centralized forces controlling can can't see, also don't
like idea like not censoring anything. always biggest problem
that, central decider, think can decide want
see not, good companion reminds felt last time
this, felt good last time this. - Man, feel like every good story,
guide companion flies out, forges little bit further, little bit
differently brings back information helps us, least tries steer us
right direction. - So, yeah, exactly thinking working on.
mention bunch difficulties here, see little bit
recently. So, technically lot challenges here. Just like lot
technologies, reason talking podcast comfortably opposed
working secret, really hard maybe time not come.
something constantly struggle terms like entrepreneurially
startup, like also mentioned you, maybe offline, really don't care money,

01:16:57 Challenges Creativity

don't care business success, kinds things. So, difficult decision
make, much time want go give everything
this? big roll dice. also realized working
problems, robotics technical side terms machine-learning
system describing, lonely, really lonely. personal level
technical level. So, technical level, surrounded people kind


doubt me, think entrepreneurs go through. doubt following
sense, know difficult is. Like people colleagues mine,
know difficult life-long learning is, also know difficult build system
like this, build competitive social network. general, kind
loneliness just working something long periods time.
start doubt whether, given don't track record success, like
big one. look mirror, especially young, still
that, things, look mirror, like, big dreams,
know actually smart think are? Like know
going able accomplish dream? ambition. - sort don't,
kind pulling string hoping bigger ball yarn. - Yeah.
[Andrew laughing] kind intuition. think pride knowing
good at, reason intuition, 'cause think good
knowing things suck at, basically everything. So, like whenever
notice like, wait minute, kind good this, rare me. think like
that, might ball yarn worth pulling at. thing terms
engineering systems able interact humans, think good that.
talk podcasting on, don't know good
podcasts. - good podcasting, right? - certainly don't, think maybe
compelling people watch kindhearted idiot struggle form, maybe
compelling. terms like actual good engineer human-robot
interaction systems, think good. hard know it,
world keeps telling not, full doll, really hard.
struggling recently, kind fascinating struggle.
Goggins thing comes in, like, aside state-hard motherfucker, the, like
whenever struggling, good sign keep going, going
alone success, right? - Well, case, however, agree. actually David
post recently thought among many brilliant posts, one
brilliant talked myth light end tunnel.
instead, replaced myth with, concept eventually, eyes
adapt dark. tunnel, not light end, really
adapting dark tunnel. Goggins- - love much. - Yeah.
got share lot common knowing bit, share lot common.
loneliness pursuit dream, seems me, certain component


extremely valuable, loneliness serve driver
build companion journey. - Well, deeply aware that. So, like
people can make, 'cause talk love lot, really love everything world,
also love humans, friendship romantic, like even cheesy stuff, just- - like
romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, got much Rogan
like, Tango scene "Scent Woman,"

01:21:49 Suits & Dresses

find like nothing better woman red dress, just like classy- -
move Argentina friend. father's Argentine, know
said went podcast first time? said, dresses well.
Argentina, men go wedding party something, U.S., halfway
night, 10 minutes night, jackets off. - Yeah. - looks like
everyone's undressing party just got dressed for. said, know,
liked way dresses. started, talking you.
started podcast, said, don't wear real suit like friend Lex?

01:22:22 Loneliness

[laughing] - remember that. - No, can't. talk pursuit just bit
more, think talking about, building a, not just solution
loneliness, alluded loneliness itself, important thing. think
right. think within people, like caverns faults shame, also just
desire resonance, seen heard. don't even know seen
heard language. reservoirs loneliness, think, well,
interesting, maybe comment little bit it. just often
talk love, haven't quantified it, seems talk loneliness,
maybe just willing, share little bit that,
feels like now pursuit building robot-human relationship. been,
let direct, spending lot time building robot-human
relationship, at? - Oh, terms business, terms systems? - No,
talking specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, mention things.
So, one, startup idea hope millions people can use.


personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going
stairs, saw slip. big guy, wasn't 200 pounds,
90 pounds, bulldog, pretty big fit. noticed
wasn't carrying foot back like injured, no feeling all.
never liked touch hind paws, do, thing just flopping there.
vet found spinal degeneration told next one
go. suffer? Sure, hope not, something changed eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah,
eyes again, know spend long hours phone tell
like eyes convey mean internal states


sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking
Costello peeing. losing ability stand that, falling
that. think started realize. passage easy
peaceful, say this, not ashamed say it, mean, wake every morning
since just, don't even make conscious decision allow self cry, wake
crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief
moment. - Yeah. gone. - the, going gone lot people
too. - Well, struggling with. think maybe pretty good this.
Like, done before? [Andrew laughing] challenge. actually
part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

terms, neural networks, computational methods, actually didn't know neural
network works deep learning now become kind synonymous. -
No, always thing. - Interesting. was, so. - neuroscientist
didn't know that. - So, well, neural networks probably means something else
neural science not something else, little different flavor depending field.
fascinating too, neuroscience AI people started working
together dancing lot recent,

00:26:46 Machine & Human Learning

say probably decade. - Oh, machines going brain. couple
questions, one thing sort fixated find incredibly interesting
example gave playing game mutated version competitor.
- Yeah. - find incredibly interesting kind parallel mirror
happens try learn humans, generate repetitions
whatever trying learn, make errors. Occasionally succeed.
simple example, instance, trying throw bulls eyes dartboard. - Yeah. -
going errors, errors, errors. probably miss dartboard. maybe
occasionally, hit bullseye. don't know exactly just did, right?
say playing darts version wearing visual prism,
like visual, visual defect, learn certain things mode well.
saying machine can sort mutate itself, mutation always cause
deficiency needs overcome? mutations biology sometimes give
us super powers, right? Occasionally, get somebody better 2020
vision, can see better 99.9% people there. So, talk
machine playing game mutated version itself, mutation always say
call negative mutation, adaptive maladaptive mutation? - No,
don't know get, so, mutate first figure compete
other. - So, evolving, machine gets evolve real time. -
Yeah. think it, exciting actually humans.
not just. So, usually freeze version system. So, really take Andrew
yesterday make 10 clones them. maybe mutate, maybe not.
bunch competitions Andrew today, like fight
death, wins last. So, love idea like creating bunch clones


like day past year, just seeing going better
like podcasting science, picking chicks bar don't know, competing
Jujitsu. one way it, mean, lot Lexes die
process, essentially happens, reinforcement learning
self-play mechanisms, graveyard systems didn't well.
surviving, good ones survive. - think that, mean, Darwin's Theory
Evolution might worked sense way, population level.
mean, get bunch birds different shaped beaks birds
shaped beak allows get seeds. mean, trivially simple example
Darwinian evolution, think correct even though not exhaustive.
referring to? essentially normally done members
different species, lots different members species different traits get
selected for, actually create multiple versions different
traits. - So, with, probably said this, perhaps implied machine
learning, reinforcement learning processes. One big
requirements, objective function, loss function, utility function,
different terms thing, like equation says good,
trying optimize equation. So, clear goal
systems. - game, like chess, goal. - anything.
Anything want machine learning solve, needs objective function.
machine learning, usually called Loss Function, optimizing.
interesting thing evolution, complicated course, goal also seems
evolving. Like a, guess, adaptation environment, goal,
unclear can convert always. like survival fittest. unclear
fittest is. machine learning, starting point, like human ingenuity
provides, fitness function good bad, lets know
systems going win. So, need equation like that. One
fascinating things humans, figure objective functions ourselves.
Like meaning life, like hell here? machine currently
hard-coded statement why. - meaning of- - Yeah. -
Artificial intelligence-based life. - Right. can't. So, like lot interesting
explorations function curiosity, learning new things
kind stuff, still hard coded. want machine able
good stuff, given clear statements good stuff means.


one challenges artificial intelligence, formalize the, order
solve problem, formalize provide like full
sensory information, clear data
collected, also clear objective function.

00:32:21 Curiosity

goal trying reach? difficult thing artificial
intelligence. - love mentioned curiosity, sure definition falls short
many ways, define curiosity strong interest knowing something, without
attachment outcome. sort a, random search, not
really emotional attachment, really just desire discover unveil
without hoping gold coin rock, just looking rocks.
less the, within machine learning, sounds like elements
reward prediction rewards. machine know done right thing.
So, can make machines curious, sorts machines
describing, curious design? - Yeah, curiosity kind symptom, not goal. So,
happens, one big trade-offs reinforcement learning, exploration
versus exploitation. So, know little, pays off explore lot, even
suboptimal, like even trajectories seem like not going lead anywhere,
called exploration. smarter smarter smarter get,
emphasis put exploitation, meaning take best solution, take best
path. Now, process, exploration can look like curiosity us humans,
really just trying get local optimal, thing already discovered.
AI perspective, always looking optimize objective function, derives,
can talk slot more, terms tools machine learning today,
derives no pleasure just curiosity like, don't know, discovery. - So,
no dopamine machine learning. - no dopamine. - no reward, system
chemical, guess electronic-reward system. - said, look machine
learning literature reinforcement learning literature, will use, like deep mind,
use terms like dopamine, constantly trying use human brain inspire totally
new solutions problems. So, think like, dopamine function
human brain, can lead interesting ways discover optimal
solutions? ultimately currently, formal objective function. Now,


argue humans also set objective functions try optimize,
just not able introspect them. - Yeah, don't actually know looking
seeking doing. - Well, like Lisa Feldman Barrett spoken least
Instagram, hope you- - met you, yeah. - Yeah, hope actually
podcast. - Yes, terrific. - So, very,
homeostasis like that. Basically, dumb objective function brain
trying optimize, like keep like body temperature same. Like dom
kind optimization function happening. humans fancy
consciousness cognitive abilities, tell stories can nice
podcasts, really brain trying maintain a, just like healthy state, guess.
fascinating. also see human brain, hope artificial intelligence systems,
not just systems solve problems, optimize goal, also storytellers.
think power telling stories. tell stories other,
communication is. Like alone, solve problems,
makes sense talk solving problems. community,
capability communicate, tell stories, share ideas way ideas
stable long period time, like, charismatic storyteller.
think humans good this. Arguably, argue
are, great storytellers. AI hope will also become that. So, not
just able solve problems clear objective function,

00:36:55 Story Telling Robots

afterwards, able tell like way better, like make way better story
something, failed. - So, think robots or, and/or
machines sort going start telling human stories? - Well, definitely. So,
technical field called Explainable AI, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, trying
figure get AI system explain us humans hell failed,
succeeded, lot different sort versions this, visualize
understands world. really difficult problem, especially neural networks
famously opaque, don't understand many cases, particular
neural network well, try figure going fail,
requires AI explain itself. huge amount money, like huge
amount money this, especially government funding on.


want deploy AI systems real world, humans least, want ask
question like, hell that? Like dark way, just kill
person, right? Like car ran person, want understand happened.
now again, sometimes unfair AI systems humans can
often not explain well. field Explainable AI people
interested rely AI systems, like Twitter
recommender system, AI algorithm that's, say impacting elections, perhaps
starting wars, least military conflict, algorithm, want ask algorithm,
first all, know hell doing? understand society-level
effects having? can explain possible trajectories? Like
kind conversation human, want able
AI. personal level, think nice talk AI systems stupid
stuff, like robots fail to- - Why'd fall stairs? - Yeah. not
engineering question, almost like endearing question, like looking for, fell
hanging out, don't think need explanation exactly
dynamics, like actuated system problem here? Like
texture floor? on. like, the- - No, want know
thinking. - That, might joke like, drunk again, go home, something,
like humor it, opportunity. Like storytelling, isn't just
explanation happened, something makes people laugh, makes people
fall love, makes people dream, understand things way poetry makes
people understand things opposed rigorous log every sensor was,
every actuator was. - mean, find incredible one hallmarks
severe autism spectrum disorders is, report experience autistic person
much catalog action steps. like, feel today? say,
well, got this, this, this. not way
person doesn't autism spectrum disorder respond. way
describe machines much humanism,

00:40:48 Defines Robot?

much human biological element, realized talking
machines. want make sure understand distinction
machine learns, machine artificial intelligence robot. Like point


machine become robot? So, ballpoint pen, assuming wouldn't
call robot, ballpoint pen can come moved opposite
side table, moves whatever mechanism, point, become
robot? - Okay, 1 million ways explore question. fascinating one. So,
first all, question life? Like know something living
form not? question sort a, maybe cold
computational system becomes a, already loading words lot meaning,
robot machine, So, one, think movement important, kind boring
idea robot just machine able act world. So, one artificial
intelligence just thinking thing, think machine learning
is, also acting thing, usually think robots. So, robots
things perception system able take world however
define world, able think learn whatever hell inside,
act world. So, difference maybe AI system learning
machine robot, something able, robot something able
perceive world act world. - So, language sound,
movement both. - Yeah. think also digital
space long aspect entity inside machine world
outside machine. sense machine sensing world
acting it. - So, could, instance, version robot, according
definition think providing, robot, go sleep night
robot goes forges information thinks want see loaded onto
desktop morning. no movement machine, no
language, essentially, movement cyberspace. - Yeah, distinction
think important element entity, whether
digital physical space. So, something like Alexa home,
speech recognition, Alexa doing, constantly sent
back mothership. Alexa own, me, robot,
interacting world. simply finger main mothership,
Alexa not robot, just interaction device, may main
Amazon Alexa AI, big, big system robot. So, important
element, us humans, think, want entity, whether
digital physical space, ideas consciousness come
kinds things project understanding means being.



00:44:30 Magic & Surprise

so, take further, machine become robot, think
special moment. special moment person's life robot's life
surprises you. think surprise really powerful thing, know thing
works yet surprises you, magical moment us humans. So, whether
chess-playing program something haven't seen before, makes
people smile like, huh, moments happen AlphaZero first time chess
playing, grand masters really surprised move. didn't understand
move studied studied understood it.
moment surprise, grandmasters chess. find moment surprise
really powerful, really magical just everyday life. - supersedes human
brain moment? - So, not supersedes, like outperforms, surprises
positive sense. Like didn't think that, didn't think you.
think moment big transition robot moment servant
accomplishes particular task level accuracy, rate
failure, entity, struggling just like world.
really important moment think not going find many people AI
community talk like just did. not speaking like philosopher hippie,
speaking purely engineering perspective. think really important robots
become entities explore real engineering problem, opposed
everybody treats robots robotics community, don't even call
she, don't give them, try avoid giving names, really want see like
system, like servant. see servant trying accomplish task.
me, don't think just romanticizing notion, think being, currently
perhaps dumb being, long arc history, humans pretty dumb beings
too, so- - agree statement. [Andrew laughing] - So, tend really want
explore treating robots really entities, yeah. So, like anthropomorphization,
sort act looking inanimate object projecting onto life-like
features, think robotics generally sees negative, see superpower. Like
that, need use that. - Well, struck really grabs onto relationship

00:47:37 Robots Change Us



human machine, human robot. So, guess simple question is,
think already told us answer, interacting robot change
you? words, develop relationships robots? - Yeah, definitely think so.
think moment see robot AI systems just servants entities,
begin change you, just like good friends do, just like relationships just
humans. think that, certain aspects interaction. Like
robot's ability say no, sense identity, set goals,
not constantly serving you, instead, trying understand world
dance understanding communication you. So, definitely think a,
mean, lot thoughts may know, core
life-long dream actually want do, believe people
notion loneliness haven't discovered, haven't explored,
say. see AI systems helping us explore can become
better humans, better people towards other. So, think connection
human AI, human robot, not possible, will help us understand
ways like several orders magnitude deeper ever
imagined. tend believe [sighing]

00:49:35 Relationships Defined

well, wild levels belief terms impactful will be, right? - So,
think human relationships, don't always break variables,
explore variables see map human-robot
relationships. One just time, right? spend zero time another person
cyberspace phone person, essentially no relationship them.
spend lot time, relationship, obvious. guess one variable
time, much time spend entity, robot human.
wins successes. enjoy successes together. give absolutely
trivial example moment, failures. struggle
somebody, whether not struggle one another, disagree, like
really struck fact said robot saying no, never thought
robot saying no me, is. - look forward one first people
send robots to. - I. So, struggle. struggle somebody,


grow closer. Sometimes struggles imposed two people,
called trauma bonding, call whole psychology literature pop psychology
literature. case, can imagine. So, time successes together, struggle together,
just peaceful time, hanging home, watching movies, waking near one
another, here, breaking elements relationships kind. So,
think elements apply robot-human relationships? so, see
how, robot entity autonomy terms reacts
you, not just just serve you, not just servant, actually opinions,
can tell maybe thinking flawed, actions flawed. - can
also leave. - also leave. So, never conceptualized robot-human interactions
way. So, tell might look. thinking human-
appearing robot? know intense relationships our,
separate dogs obviously, animals, sounds lot like human-animal interaction.
So, ideal human-robot relationship? - So, lot said here,
actually pinpointed one big, big first steps, idea time.
huge limitation machine-learning community currently. Now back like
actual details. Life-long learning problem space focuses AI systems can
learn long period time. currently machine learning systems not
able do, things listed time, successes, failures,
just chilling together watching movies, AI systems not able that,
beautiful, magical moments believe days filled with, not able keep
track together you. - 'Cause can't move you. -
No, no, like literally don't techniques learning, actual learning
containing moments. Current machine-learning systems really focused
understanding world following way, like perception system, like
looking around, understand like scene. bunch people
sitting down, cameras microphones, table, understand
that. fact shared moment talking today, still remember
like next time something, remember moment happened. don't
know technique-wise. hoping innovate think
very, important component means create deeper relationship,
sharing moments together. - post photo robot, like selfie
robot robot sees image recognizes time spent,
smiles, tears- - Yeah. - create sort metric emotional depth


relationship update behavior? - So. - it... texts middle
night say, haven't texted back? - Well, yes, things,
can dig that. think time element, forget everything else, just sharing
moments together, changes everything. believe changes everything. Now,
specific things terms systems can explain you.
technical probably little bit offline, 'cause kind wild ideas can
revolutionize social networks operating systems. point element alone,
forget things talking like emotions, saying no, that, just
remembering sharing moments together change everything. don't currently
systems share moments together. Like even just fridge, just
times, went late night ate thing shouldn't eaten,
secret moment refrigerator. shared moment, darkness
beautiful moment just like heartbroken reason,
eating ice cream whatever, special moment. refrigerator
you, fact missed opportunity remember tragic.
remember that, think going attached refrigerator.
going go hell refrigerator. us have, like
developed world, weird relationships food, right? So, can go
deep moments trauma triumph food, core that,
refrigerator. So, smart refrigerator, believe change society. Not just
refrigerator, ideas systems around us. So, just want comment
powerful idea time is. bunch elements actual
interaction allowing human feel like heard. Truly heard, truly
understood, human, like deep friendship like that, think, still
element selfishness, still element not really able understand
another human. lot times going trauma together,
difficult times successes, actually starting get inkling
understanding other, think done aggressively,
efficiently. Like think great therapist, think never actually
therapist, believer used want psychiatrist. - Russians go
therapists? - No, don't. don't. do, therapist don't live tell
story. believe talk therapy, friendship me, talk therapy, like
don't even necessarily need talk [laughing] like just connecting
space ideas space experiences. think lot ideas


make AI systems able ask right questions truly hear another human.
try podcasting, right? think ways AI.
else, just remembering collection moments make day,
week, months, think maybe well. closest
friends still friends high school. time, bunch
together, like different people. just fact
that, remember moments, moments somehow create
depth connection like nothing else, like refrigerator. - love
graduate advisor, unfortunately, passed away, passed away,
somebody said memorial amazing things done, et cetera.
kids got there, young children knew
pregnant them. so, really, even now can feel like heart
gets heavy, thinking this, going grow without mother.
really amazing, strong young girls, now young women. said
incredible, said really appreciated mother,
amazing person, unstructured time spent together. - Mm-hmm. - So,
wasn't trips zoo, wasn't woke five morning drove us
school. things too. two hour commute direction,
incredible, ran lab, et cetera, unstructured time. So, passing
mother, remembered biggest give bonded
her, time just kind hung out. way describe
relationship refrigerator so, want say human-like, almost reluctant
say that. realizing talking, think
human-like might actually lower form relationship. may relationships
far better sorts relationships can conceive minds right
now based machine relationship interactions teach us.
right? - Yeah, think so. think no reason see machines somehow
incapable teaching us something deeply human. don't think humans
monopoly that. think understand poorly need
kind prompting machine. definitely part that, just remembering
moments. think unstructured time together, wonder quite unstructured.
like calling podcast structured time. - Maybe meant,
wasn't big outing, no specific goal, goal created lack
goal. Like just hang start playing, thumb war,


end playing thumb war hour. So, structure emerges lack
structure. - No, thing moments, something times
creates special moments, think optimized for. think think like
big outing as, don't know, going Six Flags something, big, Grand
Canyon, go some, don't know, think need to, don't quite yet
understand, humans, creates magical moments. think possible optimize
lot things. perhaps like podcasting helping people discover that, like
maybe thing want optimize isn't necessarily like sexy, like quick clips,
maybe want, long-form authenticity. - Depth. - Depth. So, trying
figure out, certainly deep connection humans humans NAS
systems, think long conversations, long periods communication series
moments like new, perhaps, seemingly insignificant big ones, big
successes, big failures, just stitching together talking
throughout. think formula really, really deep connection. like
specific engineering perspective, think fascinating open problem
really worked much. me, a, guts

01:02:29 Lex’s Dream Humanity

and, mean lot things say, one guts, build startup around
it. - So, talk startup talk dream. mentioned
dream previous conversations, always little hints dropped
there. Just anyone listening, never offline conversation
dream, not privy anything, except Lex says now. realized
no way capture full essence dream kind verbal statement way
captures it. dream referred now several times
sat together talked phone? Maybe company,
maybe something distinct. feel comfortable, it'd great share
little bit is. - Sure. So, way people express long-term vision,
noticed quite different. Like Elon example somebody can crisply say
exactly goal is. Also fact problems solving
nothing humans. So, long-term vision little bit difficult express
words, noticed, tried, brain's failure, way
sneak it. So, let just say things. Early life also recent


years, interacted robots understood magic there.
magic shared millions brought light. first met Spot
Boston Dynamics, realized magic nobody else seeing. - dog.
- dog, sorry. Spot four-legged robot Boston Dynamics. people
might seen it, yellow dog. sometimes life, just notice something
just grabs you. believe something magic something
every single device world. way think maybe Steve Jobs
thought personal computer, laws didn't think personal computer
way, Steve did. like, thought personal computer
thin sheet paper everybody one, idea, think
heartbreaking getting, world filled machines
soulless. think every one can magic. One things
also inspired terms startup, magic can engineered much easier
thought. intuition everything ever built worked on. So, dream
add bit magic every single computing system world. So, way
Windows Operating System long time primary operating system
everybody interacted with, built apps top it. think something
layer, almost operating system every device humans
interacted world. Now, actually looks like, actual dream
officially kid, didn't concrete form business, dream
exploring loneliness interacting machines, robots. deep
connection humans robots always dream. so, me, love
see world every home robot, not robot washes
dishes, sex robot, don't know, think kind activity robot can do,
like companion. - family member. - family member, way dog is. - Mm-
hmm. - dog able speak language too. So, not just connect way
dog looking looking away almost like smiling soul
kind way, also actually understand hell, like, excited
successes? Like understand details, understand traumas. that,
just think [sighing] always filled excitement could, artificial
intelligence, bring joy lot people. recently,
heartbroken see kind division, derision, even hate boiling
internet social networks. thought kind mechanism exactly
applicable context social networks well. So, operating system


serves guide internet. One biggest problems YouTube
social networks currently, optimizing engagement. think create AI
systems know individual person, able optimize long-term growth
long-term happiness. - individual, or- - individual, individual.
lot things say, order AI systems learn
everything you, need collect, need just like talk
offline, collecting data others secrets other, way
AI that. allows to, requires rethink ideas
ownership data. think individual data easily
able leave just like AI systems can leave, humans can disappear delete
data moment's notice. actually better humans can do,
load data other, there. think important both, give people
complete control data order establish trust can trust you.
second part trust transparency. Whenever data used make clear
used for. not clear lawyerly legal sense, clear way
people really understand used for. believe people ability
delete data walk away know data used, think
stay. - possibility clean breakup, actually will keep people together. -
Yeah, think so. think, exactly. think happy marriage acquires ability divorce
easily without divorce industrial complex whatever. Things currently going
much money made lawyers divorce. yeah, ability
leave enables love, think. - interesting. heard phrase semi-
cynical friend, marriage leading cause divorce, now heard
divorce, possibility divorce leading cause marriage. - happy
marriage. - Good point. - happy marriage. So, yeah. So, lot details
there, big dream connection AI system human.
haven't. much fear artificial intelligence systems robots
haven't quite found right words express vision vision have,
not like naive, delusional vision like technology going save everybody,
really just positive view ways AI systems can help humans explore
themselves. - love positivity agree stance everything doomed
equally bad say everything's going turn right, dedicated
effort. clearly, thinking dedicated effort look like.
mentioned two aspects dream [clears throat] want make sure


understand connect do, independent streams. One
hypothetical robot family member, form robot allow
people experience kind delight experienced many times,

01:11:33 Improving Social Media

like world able have, beautiful idea
give. social media social network platforms really serve
individuals best selves happiness growth. crossover
those, two parallel dreams? - 100% thing.
difficult kind explain without going details, maybe one easy way
explain way think social networks, create AI system yours.
not like Amazon Alexa centralized, data, like little friend
becomes representative Twitter helps find things will make feel
good, will also challenge thinking make grow, not get that, not let
get lost negative spiral dopamine, gets angry, just
get not open learning. so, little representative optimizing
long-term health. believe not good human beings, also good
business. think longterm, can make lot money challenging idea
way make money, maximizing engagement. one things
people disagree on, think Twitter's always going win. Like maximizing
engagement always going win, don't think so. think people woken now
understanding that, like don't always feel good, ones Twitter lot,
don't always feel good end week. - love feedback
whatever creature, whatever, don't know call it, maybe end
week, automatically unfollow people follow
realized really smart data feeling inside,
sleeping, something that, don't know, just wasn't good me. might also
put things people front see, kind sliver
look like? - whole point, interaction, sharing moments
learning lot you, now able understand interactions led
become better version yourself. Like person happy with.
isn't, flat earth feel good it, believe earth
flat, like idea sensor ridiculous. makes feel good


becoming best version yourself, think getting much flat
earth possible. Now, also good challenge ideas, not
centralized committee decided, tell system like
challenging ideas, think us do. then, actually YouTube doesn't
well, go flat-earth rabbit hole, going see.
nice get really powerful communicators argue flat earth. nice
see you, potentially, least long-term expand horizons, maybe
earth not flat. continue live whole life thinking earth flat,
think, good father son daughter, like best
version happy yourself, think earth flat. So, like think
kind idea, just using kind silly, ridiculous example don't
like idea centralized forces controlling can can't see, also don't
like idea like not censoring anything. always biggest problem
that, central decider, think can decide want
see not, good companion reminds felt last time
this, felt good last time this. - Man, feel like every good story,
guide companion flies out, forges little bit further, little bit
differently brings back information helps us, least tries steer us
right direction. - So, yeah, exactly thinking working on.
mention bunch difficulties here, see little bit
recently. So, technically lot challenges here. Just like lot
technologies, reason talking podcast comfortably opposed
working secret, really hard maybe time not come.
something constantly struggle terms like entrepreneurially
startup, like also mentioned you, maybe offline, really don't care money,

01:16:57 Challenges Creativity

don't care business success, kinds things. So, difficult decision
make, much time want go give everything
this? big roll dice. also realized working
problems, robotics technical side terms machine-learning
system describing, lonely, really lonely. personal level
technical level. So, technical level, surrounded people kind


doubt me, think entrepreneurs go through. doubt following
sense, know difficult is. Like people colleagues mine,
know difficult life-long learning is, also know difficult build system
like this, build competitive social network. general, kind
loneliness just working something long periods time.
start doubt whether, given don't track record success, like
big one. look mirror, especially young, still
that, things, look mirror, like, big dreams,
know actually smart think are? Like know
going able accomplish dream? ambition. - sort don't,
kind pulling string hoping bigger ball yarn. - Yeah.
[Andrew laughing] kind intuition. think pride knowing
good at, reason intuition, 'cause think good
knowing things suck at, basically everything. So, like whenever
notice like, wait minute, kind good this, rare me. think like
that, might ball yarn worth pulling at. thing terms
engineering systems able interact humans, think good that.
talk podcasting on, don't know good
podcasts. - good podcasting, right? - certainly don't, think maybe
compelling people watch kindhearted idiot struggle form, maybe
compelling. terms like actual good engineer human-robot
interaction systems, think good. hard know it,
world keeps telling not, full doll, really hard.
struggling recently, kind fascinating struggle.
Goggins thing comes in, like, aside state-hard motherfucker, the, like
whenever struggling, good sign keep going, going
alone success, right? - Well, case, however, agree. actually David
post recently thought among many brilliant posts, one
brilliant talked myth light end tunnel.
instead, replaced myth with, concept eventually, eyes
adapt dark. tunnel, not light end, really
adapting dark tunnel. Goggins- - love much. - Yeah.
got share lot common knowing bit, share lot common.
loneliness pursuit dream, seems me, certain component


extremely valuable, loneliness serve driver
build companion journey. - Well, deeply aware that. So, like
people can make, 'cause talk love lot, really love everything world,
also love humans, friendship romantic, like even cheesy stuff, just- - like
romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, got much Rogan
like, Tango scene "Scent Woman,"

01:21:49 Suits & Dresses

find like nothing better woman red dress, just like classy- -
move Argentina friend. father's Argentine, know
said went podcast first time? said, dresses well.
Argentina, men go wedding party something, U.S., halfway
night, 10 minutes night, jackets off. - Yeah. - looks like
everyone's undressing party just got dressed for. said, know,
liked way dresses. started, talking you.
started podcast, said, don't wear real suit like friend Lex?

01:22:22 Loneliness

[laughing] - remember that. - No, can't. talk pursuit just bit
more, think talking about, building a, not just solution
loneliness, alluded loneliness itself, important thing. think
right. think within people, like caverns faults shame, also just
desire resonance, seen heard. don't even know seen
heard language. reservoirs loneliness, think, well,
interesting, maybe comment little bit it. just often
talk love, haven't quantified it, seems talk loneliness,
maybe just willing, share little bit that,
feels like now pursuit building robot-human relationship. been,
let direct, spending lot time building robot-human
relationship, at? - Oh, terms business, terms systems? - No,
talking specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, mention things.
So, one, startup idea hope millions people can use.


personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going
stairs, saw slip. big guy, wasn't 200 pounds,
90 pounds, bulldog, pretty big fit. noticed
wasn't carrying foot back like injured, no feeling all.
never liked touch hind paws, do, thing just flopping there.
vet found spinal degeneration told next one
go. suffer? Sure, hope not, something changed eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah,
eyes again, know spend long hours phone tell
like eyes convey mean internal states


sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking
Costello peeing. losing ability stand that, falling
that. think started realize. passage easy
peaceful, say this, not ashamed say it, mean, wake every morning
since just, don't even make conscious decision allow self cry, wake
crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief
moment. - Yeah. gone. - the, going gone lot people
too. - Well, struggling with. think maybe pretty good this.
Like, done before? [Andrew laughing] challenge. actually
part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

like day past year, just seeing going better
like podcasting science, picking chicks bar don't know, competing
Jujitsu. one way it, mean, lot Lexes die
process, essentially happens, reinforcement learning
self-play mechanisms, graveyard systems didn't well.
surviving, good ones survive. - think that, mean, Darwin's Theory
Evolution might worked sense way, population level.
mean, get bunch birds different shaped beaks birds
shaped beak allows get seeds. mean, trivially simple example
Darwinian evolution, think correct even though not exhaustive.
referring to? essentially normally done members
different species, lots different members species different traits get
selected for, actually create multiple versions different
traits. - So, with, probably said this, perhaps implied machine
learning, reinforcement learning processes. One big
requirements, objective function, loss function, utility function,
different terms thing, like equation says good,
trying optimize equation. So, clear goal
systems. - game, like chess, goal. - anything.
Anything want machine learning solve, needs objective function.
machine learning, usually called Loss Function, optimizing.
interesting thing evolution, complicated course, goal also seems
evolving. Like a, guess, adaptation environment, goal,
unclear can convert always. like survival fittest. unclear
fittest is. machine learning, starting point, like human ingenuity
provides, fitness function good bad, lets know
systems going win. So, need equation like that. One
fascinating things humans, figure objective functions ourselves.
Like meaning life, like hell here? machine currently
hard-coded statement why. - meaning of- - Yeah. -
Artificial intelligence-based life. - Right. can't. So, like lot interesting
explorations function curiosity, learning new things
kind stuff, still hard coded. want machine able
good stuff, given clear statements good stuff means.


one challenges artificial intelligence, formalize the, order
solve problem, formalize provide like full
sensory information, clear data
collected, also clear objective function.

00:32:21 Curiosity

goal trying reach? difficult thing artificial
intelligence. - love mentioned curiosity, sure definition falls short
many ways, define curiosity strong interest knowing something, without
attachment outcome. sort a, random search, not
really emotional attachment, really just desire discover unveil
without hoping gold coin rock, just looking rocks.
less the, within machine learning, sounds like elements
reward prediction rewards. machine know done right thing.
So, can make machines curious, sorts machines
describing, curious design? - Yeah, curiosity kind symptom, not goal. So,
happens, one big trade-offs reinforcement learning, exploration
versus exploitation. So, know little, pays off explore lot, even
suboptimal, like even trajectories seem like not going lead anywhere,
called exploration. smarter smarter smarter get,
emphasis put exploitation, meaning take best solution, take best
path. Now, process, exploration can look like curiosity us humans,
really just trying get local optimal, thing already discovered.
AI perspective, always looking optimize objective function, derives,
can talk slot more, terms tools machine learning today,
derives no pleasure just curiosity like, don't know, discovery. - So,
no dopamine machine learning. - no dopamine. - no reward, system
chemical, guess electronic-reward system. - said, look machine
learning literature reinforcement learning literature, will use, like deep mind,
use terms like dopamine, constantly trying use human brain inspire totally
new solutions problems. So, think like, dopamine function
human brain, can lead interesting ways discover optimal
solutions? ultimately currently, formal objective function. Now,


argue humans also set objective functions try optimize,
just not able introspect them. - Yeah, don't actually know looking
seeking doing. - Well, like Lisa Feldman Barrett spoken least
Instagram, hope you- - met you, yeah. - Yeah, hope actually
podcast. - Yes, terrific. - So, very,
homeostasis like that. Basically, dumb objective function brain
trying optimize, like keep like body temperature same. Like dom
kind optimization function happening. humans fancy
consciousness cognitive abilities, tell stories can nice
podcasts, really brain trying maintain a, just like healthy state, guess.
fascinating. also see human brain, hope artificial intelligence systems,
not just systems solve problems, optimize goal, also storytellers.
think power telling stories. tell stories other,
communication is. Like alone, solve problems,
makes sense talk solving problems. community,
capability communicate, tell stories, share ideas way ideas
stable long period time, like, charismatic storyteller.
think humans good this. Arguably, argue
are, great storytellers. AI hope will also become that. So, not
just able solve problems clear objective function,

00:36:55 Story Telling Robots

afterwards, able tell like way better, like make way better story
something, failed. - So, think robots or, and/or
machines sort going start telling human stories? - Well, definitely. So,
technical field called Explainable AI, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, trying
figure get AI system explain us humans hell failed,
succeeded, lot different sort versions this, visualize
understands world. really difficult problem, especially neural networks
famously opaque, don't understand many cases, particular
neural network well, try figure going fail,
requires AI explain itself. huge amount money, like huge
amount money this, especially government funding on.


want deploy AI systems real world, humans least, want ask
question like, hell that? Like dark way, just kill
person, right? Like car ran person, want understand happened.
now again, sometimes unfair AI systems humans can
often not explain well. field Explainable AI people
interested rely AI systems, like Twitter
recommender system, AI algorithm that's, say impacting elections, perhaps
starting wars, least military conflict, algorithm, want ask algorithm,
first all, know hell doing? understand society-level
effects having? can explain possible trajectories? Like
kind conversation human, want able
AI. personal level, think nice talk AI systems stupid
stuff, like robots fail to- - Why'd fall stairs? - Yeah. not
engineering question, almost like endearing question, like looking for, fell
hanging out, don't think need explanation exactly
dynamics, like actuated system problem here? Like
texture floor? on. like, the- - No, want know
thinking. - That, might joke like, drunk again, go home, something,
like humor it, opportunity. Like storytelling, isn't just
explanation happened, something makes people laugh, makes people
fall love, makes people dream, understand things way poetry makes
people understand things opposed rigorous log every sensor was,
every actuator was. - mean, find incredible one hallmarks
severe autism spectrum disorders is, report experience autistic person
much catalog action steps. like, feel today? say,
well, got this, this, this. not way
person doesn't autism spectrum disorder respond. way
describe machines much humanism,

00:40:48 Defines Robot?

much human biological element, realized talking
machines. want make sure understand distinction
machine learns, machine artificial intelligence robot. Like point


machine become robot? So, ballpoint pen, assuming wouldn't
call robot, ballpoint pen can come moved opposite
side table, moves whatever mechanism, point, become
robot? - Okay, 1 million ways explore question. fascinating one. So,
first all, question life? Like know something living
form not? question sort a, maybe cold
computational system becomes a, already loading words lot meaning,
robot machine, So, one, think movement important, kind boring
idea robot just machine able act world. So, one artificial
intelligence just thinking thing, think machine learning
is, also acting thing, usually think robots. So, robots
things perception system able take world however
define world, able think learn whatever hell inside,
act world. So, difference maybe AI system learning
machine robot, something able, robot something able
perceive world act world. - So, language sound,
movement both. - Yeah. think also digital
space long aspect entity inside machine world
outside machine. sense machine sensing world
acting it. - So, could, instance, version robot, according
definition think providing, robot, go sleep night
robot goes forges information thinks want see loaded onto
desktop morning. no movement machine, no
language, essentially, movement cyberspace. - Yeah, distinction
think important element entity, whether
digital physical space. So, something like Alexa home,
speech recognition, Alexa doing, constantly sent
back mothership. Alexa own, me, robot,
interacting world. simply finger main mothership,
Alexa not robot, just interaction device, may main
Amazon Alexa AI, big, big system robot. So, important
element, us humans, think, want entity, whether
digital physical space, ideas consciousness come
kinds things project understanding means being.



00:44:30 Magic & Surprise

so, take further, machine become robot, think
special moment. special moment person's life robot's life
surprises you. think surprise really powerful thing, know thing
works yet surprises you, magical moment us humans. So, whether
chess-playing program something haven't seen before, makes
people smile like, huh, moments happen AlphaZero first time chess
playing, grand masters really surprised move. didn't understand
move studied studied understood it.
moment surprise, grandmasters chess. find moment surprise
really powerful, really magical just everyday life. - supersedes human
brain moment? - So, not supersedes, like outperforms, surprises
positive sense. Like didn't think that, didn't think you.
think moment big transition robot moment servant
accomplishes particular task level accuracy, rate
failure, entity, struggling just like world.
really important moment think not going find many people AI
community talk like just did. not speaking like philosopher hippie,
speaking purely engineering perspective. think really important robots
become entities explore real engineering problem, opposed
everybody treats robots robotics community, don't even call
she, don't give them, try avoid giving names, really want see like
system, like servant. see servant trying accomplish task.
me, don't think just romanticizing notion, think being, currently
perhaps dumb being, long arc history, humans pretty dumb beings
too, so- - agree statement. [Andrew laughing] - So, tend really want
explore treating robots really entities, yeah. So, like anthropomorphization,
sort act looking inanimate object projecting onto life-like
features, think robotics generally sees negative, see superpower. Like
that, need use that. - Well, struck really grabs onto relationship

00:47:37 Robots Change Us



human machine, human robot. So, guess simple question is,
think already told us answer, interacting robot change
you? words, develop relationships robots? - Yeah, definitely think so.
think moment see robot AI systems just servants entities,
begin change you, just like good friends do, just like relationships just
humans. think that, certain aspects interaction. Like
robot's ability say no, sense identity, set goals,
not constantly serving you, instead, trying understand world
dance understanding communication you. So, definitely think a,
mean, lot thoughts may know, core
life-long dream actually want do, believe people
notion loneliness haven't discovered, haven't explored,
say. see AI systems helping us explore can become
better humans, better people towards other. So, think connection
human AI, human robot, not possible, will help us understand
ways like several orders magnitude deeper ever
imagined. tend believe [sighing]

00:49:35 Relationships Defined

well, wild levels belief terms impactful will be, right? - So,
think human relationships, don't always break variables,
explore variables see map human-robot
relationships. One just time, right? spend zero time another person
cyberspace phone person, essentially no relationship them.
spend lot time, relationship, obvious. guess one variable
time, much time spend entity, robot human.
wins successes. enjoy successes together. give absolutely
trivial example moment, failures. struggle
somebody, whether not struggle one another, disagree, like
really struck fact said robot saying no, never thought
robot saying no me, is. - look forward one first people
send robots to. - I. So, struggle. struggle somebody,


grow closer. Sometimes struggles imposed two people,
called trauma bonding, call whole psychology literature pop psychology
literature. case, can imagine. So, time successes together, struggle together,
just peaceful time, hanging home, watching movies, waking near one
another, here, breaking elements relationships kind. So,
think elements apply robot-human relationships? so, see
how, robot entity autonomy terms reacts
you, not just just serve you, not just servant, actually opinions,
can tell maybe thinking flawed, actions flawed. - can
also leave. - also leave. So, never conceptualized robot-human interactions
way. So, tell might look. thinking human-
appearing robot? know intense relationships our,
separate dogs obviously, animals, sounds lot like human-animal interaction.
So, ideal human-robot relationship? - So, lot said here,
actually pinpointed one big, big first steps, idea time.
huge limitation machine-learning community currently. Now back like
actual details. Life-long learning problem space focuses AI systems can
learn long period time. currently machine learning systems not
able do, things listed time, successes, failures,
just chilling together watching movies, AI systems not able that,
beautiful, magical moments believe days filled with, not able keep
track together you. - 'Cause can't move you. -
No, no, like literally don't techniques learning, actual learning
containing moments. Current machine-learning systems really focused
understanding world following way, like perception system, like
looking around, understand like scene. bunch people
sitting down, cameras microphones, table, understand
that. fact shared moment talking today, still remember
like next time something, remember moment happened. don't
know technique-wise. hoping innovate think
very, important component means create deeper relationship,
sharing moments together. - post photo robot, like selfie
robot robot sees image recognizes time spent,
smiles, tears- - Yeah. - create sort metric emotional depth


relationship update behavior? - So. - it... texts middle
night say, haven't texted back? - Well, yes, things,
can dig that. think time element, forget everything else, just sharing
moments together, changes everything. believe changes everything. Now,
specific things terms systems can explain you.
technical probably little bit offline, 'cause kind wild ideas can
revolutionize social networks operating systems. point element alone,
forget things talking like emotions, saying no, that, just
remembering sharing moments together change everything. don't currently
systems share moments together. Like even just fridge, just
times, went late night ate thing shouldn't eaten,
secret moment refrigerator. shared moment, darkness
beautiful moment just like heartbroken reason,
eating ice cream whatever, special moment. refrigerator
you, fact missed opportunity remember tragic.
remember that, think going attached refrigerator.
going go hell refrigerator. us have, like
developed world, weird relationships food, right? So, can go
deep moments trauma triumph food, core that,
refrigerator. So, smart refrigerator, believe change society. Not just
refrigerator, ideas systems around us. So, just want comment
powerful idea time is. bunch elements actual
interaction allowing human feel like heard. Truly heard, truly
understood, human, like deep friendship like that, think, still
element selfishness, still element not really able understand
another human. lot times going trauma together,
difficult times successes, actually starting get inkling
understanding other, think done aggressively,
efficiently. Like think great therapist, think never actually
therapist, believer used want psychiatrist. - Russians go
therapists? - No, don't. don't. do, therapist don't live tell
story. believe talk therapy, friendship me, talk therapy, like
don't even necessarily need talk [laughing] like just connecting
space ideas space experiences. think lot ideas


make AI systems able ask right questions truly hear another human.
try podcasting, right? think ways AI.
else, just remembering collection moments make day,
week, months, think maybe well. closest
friends still friends high school. time, bunch
together, like different people. just fact
that, remember moments, moments somehow create
depth connection like nothing else, like refrigerator. - love
graduate advisor, unfortunately, passed away, passed away,
somebody said memorial amazing things done, et cetera.
kids got there, young children knew
pregnant them. so, really, even now can feel like heart
gets heavy, thinking this, going grow without mother.
really amazing, strong young girls, now young women. said
incredible, said really appreciated mother,
amazing person, unstructured time spent together. - Mm-hmm. - So,
wasn't trips zoo, wasn't woke five morning drove us
school. things too. two hour commute direction,
incredible, ran lab, et cetera, unstructured time. So, passing
mother, remembered biggest give bonded
her, time just kind hung out. way describe
relationship refrigerator so, want say human-like, almost reluctant
say that. realizing talking, think
human-like might actually lower form relationship. may relationships
far better sorts relationships can conceive minds right
now based machine relationship interactions teach us.
right? - Yeah, think so. think no reason see machines somehow
incapable teaching us something deeply human. don't think humans
monopoly that. think understand poorly need
kind prompting machine. definitely part that, just remembering
moments. think unstructured time together, wonder quite unstructured.
like calling podcast structured time. - Maybe meant,
wasn't big outing, no specific goal, goal created lack
goal. Like just hang start playing, thumb war,


end playing thumb war hour. So, structure emerges lack
structure. - No, thing moments, something times
creates special moments, think optimized for. think think like
big outing as, don't know, going Six Flags something, big, Grand
Canyon, go some, don't know, think need to, don't quite yet
understand, humans, creates magical moments. think possible optimize
lot things. perhaps like podcasting helping people discover that, like
maybe thing want optimize isn't necessarily like sexy, like quick clips,
maybe want, long-form authenticity. - Depth. - Depth. So, trying
figure out, certainly deep connection humans humans NAS
systems, think long conversations, long periods communication series
moments like new, perhaps, seemingly insignificant big ones, big
successes, big failures, just stitching together talking
throughout. think formula really, really deep connection. like
specific engineering perspective, think fascinating open problem
really worked much. me, a, guts

01:02:29 Lex’s Dream Humanity

and, mean lot things say, one guts, build startup around
it. - So, talk startup talk dream. mentioned
dream previous conversations, always little hints dropped
there. Just anyone listening, never offline conversation
dream, not privy anything, except Lex says now. realized
no way capture full essence dream kind verbal statement way
captures it. dream referred now several times
sat together talked phone? Maybe company,
maybe something distinct. feel comfortable, it'd great share
little bit is. - Sure. So, way people express long-term vision,
noticed quite different. Like Elon example somebody can crisply say
exactly goal is. Also fact problems solving
nothing humans. So, long-term vision little bit difficult express
words, noticed, tried, brain's failure, way
sneak it. So, let just say things. Early life also recent


years, interacted robots understood magic there.
magic shared millions brought light. first met Spot
Boston Dynamics, realized magic nobody else seeing. - dog.
- dog, sorry. Spot four-legged robot Boston Dynamics. people
might seen it, yellow dog. sometimes life, just notice something
just grabs you. believe something magic something
every single device world. way think maybe Steve Jobs
thought personal computer, laws didn't think personal computer
way, Steve did. like, thought personal computer
thin sheet paper everybody one, idea, think
heartbreaking getting, world filled machines
soulless. think every one can magic. One things
also inspired terms startup, magic can engineered much easier
thought. intuition everything ever built worked on. So, dream
add bit magic every single computing system world. So, way
Windows Operating System long time primary operating system
everybody interacted with, built apps top it. think something
layer, almost operating system every device humans
interacted world. Now, actually looks like, actual dream
officially kid, didn't concrete form business, dream
exploring loneliness interacting machines, robots. deep
connection humans robots always dream. so, me, love
see world every home robot, not robot washes
dishes, sex robot, don't know, think kind activity robot can do,
like companion. - family member. - family member, way dog is. - Mm-
hmm. - dog able speak language too. So, not just connect way
dog looking looking away almost like smiling soul
kind way, also actually understand hell, like, excited
successes? Like understand details, understand traumas. that,
just think [sighing] always filled excitement could, artificial
intelligence, bring joy lot people. recently,
heartbroken see kind division, derision, even hate boiling
internet social networks. thought kind mechanism exactly
applicable context social networks well. So, operating system


serves guide internet. One biggest problems YouTube
social networks currently, optimizing engagement. think create AI
systems know individual person, able optimize long-term growth
long-term happiness. - individual, or- - individual, individual.
lot things say, order AI systems learn
everything you, need collect, need just like talk
offline, collecting data others secrets other, way
AI that. allows to, requires rethink ideas
ownership data. think individual data easily
able leave just like AI systems can leave, humans can disappear delete
data moment's notice. actually better humans can do,
load data other, there. think important both, give people
complete control data order establish trust can trust you.
second part trust transparency. Whenever data used make clear
used for. not clear lawyerly legal sense, clear way
people really understand used for. believe people ability
delete data walk away know data used, think
stay. - possibility clean breakup, actually will keep people together. -
Yeah, think so. think, exactly. think happy marriage acquires ability divorce
easily without divorce industrial complex whatever. Things currently going
much money made lawyers divorce. yeah, ability
leave enables love, think. - interesting. heard phrase semi-
cynical friend, marriage leading cause divorce, now heard
divorce, possibility divorce leading cause marriage. - happy
marriage. - Good point. - happy marriage. So, yeah. So, lot details
there, big dream connection AI system human.
haven't. much fear artificial intelligence systems robots
haven't quite found right words express vision vision have,
not like naive, delusional vision like technology going save everybody,
really just positive view ways AI systems can help humans explore
themselves. - love positivity agree stance everything doomed
equally bad say everything's going turn right, dedicated
effort. clearly, thinking dedicated effort look like.
mentioned two aspects dream [clears throat] want make sure


understand connect do, independent streams. One
hypothetical robot family member, form robot allow
people experience kind delight experienced many times,

01:11:33 Improving Social Media

like world able have, beautiful idea
give. social media social network platforms really serve
individuals best selves happiness growth. crossover
those, two parallel dreams? - 100% thing.
difficult kind explain without going details, maybe one easy way
explain way think social networks, create AI system yours.
not like Amazon Alexa centralized, data, like little friend
becomes representative Twitter helps find things will make feel
good, will also challenge thinking make grow, not get that, not let
get lost negative spiral dopamine, gets angry, just
get not open learning. so, little representative optimizing
long-term health. believe not good human beings, also good
business. think longterm, can make lot money challenging idea
way make money, maximizing engagement. one things
people disagree on, think Twitter's always going win. Like maximizing
engagement always going win, don't think so. think people woken now
understanding that, like don't always feel good, ones Twitter lot,
don't always feel good end week. - love feedback
whatever creature, whatever, don't know call it, maybe end
week, automatically unfollow people follow
realized really smart data feeling inside,
sleeping, something that, don't know, just wasn't good me. might also
put things people front see, kind sliver
look like? - whole point, interaction, sharing moments
learning lot you, now able understand interactions led
become better version yourself. Like person happy with.
isn't, flat earth feel good it, believe earth
flat, like idea sensor ridiculous. makes feel good


becoming best version yourself, think getting much flat
earth possible. Now, also good challenge ideas, not
centralized committee decided, tell system like
challenging ideas, think us do. then, actually YouTube doesn't
well, go flat-earth rabbit hole, going see.
nice get really powerful communicators argue flat earth. nice
see you, potentially, least long-term expand horizons, maybe
earth not flat. continue live whole life thinking earth flat,
think, good father son daughter, like best
version happy yourself, think earth flat. So, like think
kind idea, just using kind silly, ridiculous example don't
like idea centralized forces controlling can can't see, also don't
like idea like not censoring anything. always biggest problem
that, central decider, think can decide want
see not, good companion reminds felt last time
this, felt good last time this. - Man, feel like every good story,
guide companion flies out, forges little bit further, little bit
differently brings back information helps us, least tries steer us
right direction. - So, yeah, exactly thinking working on.
mention bunch difficulties here, see little bit
recently. So, technically lot challenges here. Just like lot
technologies, reason talking podcast comfortably opposed
working secret, really hard maybe time not come.
something constantly struggle terms like entrepreneurially
startup, like also mentioned you, maybe offline, really don't care money,

01:16:57 Challenges Creativity

don't care business success, kinds things. So, difficult decision
make, much time want go give everything
this? big roll dice. also realized working
problems, robotics technical side terms machine-learning
system describing, lonely, really lonely. personal level
technical level. So, technical level, surrounded people kind


doubt me, think entrepreneurs go through. doubt following
sense, know difficult is. Like people colleagues mine,
know difficult life-long learning is, also know difficult build system
like this, build competitive social network. general, kind
loneliness just working something long periods time.
start doubt whether, given don't track record success, like
big one. look mirror, especially young, still
that, things, look mirror, like, big dreams,
know actually smart think are? Like know
going able accomplish dream? ambition. - sort don't,
kind pulling string hoping bigger ball yarn. - Yeah.
[Andrew laughing] kind intuition. think pride knowing
good at, reason intuition, 'cause think good
knowing things suck at, basically everything. So, like whenever
notice like, wait minute, kind good this, rare me. think like
that, might ball yarn worth pulling at. thing terms
engineering systems able interact humans, think good that.
talk podcasting on, don't know good
podcasts. - good podcasting, right? - certainly don't, think maybe
compelling people watch kindhearted idiot struggle form, maybe
compelling. terms like actual good engineer human-robot
interaction systems, think good. hard know it,
world keeps telling not, full doll, really hard.
struggling recently, kind fascinating struggle.
Goggins thing comes in, like, aside state-hard motherfucker, the, like
whenever struggling, good sign keep going, going
alone success, right? - Well, case, however, agree. actually David
post recently thought among many brilliant posts, one
brilliant talked myth light end tunnel.
instead, replaced myth with, concept eventually, eyes
adapt dark. tunnel, not light end, really
adapting dark tunnel. Goggins- - love much. - Yeah.
got share lot common knowing bit, share lot common.
loneliness pursuit dream, seems me, certain component


extremely valuable, loneliness serve driver
build companion journey. - Well, deeply aware that. So, like
people can make, 'cause talk love lot, really love everything world,
also love humans, friendship romantic, like even cheesy stuff, just- - like
romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, got much Rogan
like, Tango scene "Scent Woman,"

01:21:49 Suits & Dresses

find like nothing better woman red dress, just like classy- -
move Argentina friend. father's Argentine, know
said went podcast first time? said, dresses well.
Argentina, men go wedding party something, U.S., halfway
night, 10 minutes night, jackets off. - Yeah. - looks like
everyone's undressing party just got dressed for. said, know,
liked way dresses. started, talking you.
started podcast, said, don't wear real suit like friend Lex?

01:22:22 Loneliness

[laughing] - remember that. - No, can't. talk pursuit just bit
more, think talking about, building a, not just solution
loneliness, alluded loneliness itself, important thing. think
right. think within people, like caverns faults shame, also just
desire resonance, seen heard. don't even know seen
heard language. reservoirs loneliness, think, well,
interesting, maybe comment little bit it. just often
talk love, haven't quantified it, seems talk loneliness,
maybe just willing, share little bit that,
feels like now pursuit building robot-human relationship. been,
let direct, spending lot time building robot-human
relationship, at? - Oh, terms business, terms systems? - No,
talking specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, mention things.
So, one, startup idea hope millions people can use.


personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going
stairs, saw slip. big guy, wasn't 200 pounds,
90 pounds, bulldog, pretty big fit. noticed
wasn't carrying foot back like injured, no feeling all.
never liked touch hind paws, do, thing just flopping there.
vet found spinal degeneration told next one
go. suffer? Sure, hope not, something changed eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah,
eyes again, know spend long hours phone tell
like eyes convey mean internal states


sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking

colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know

ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]

Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids

like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,

different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

one challenges artificial intelligence, formalize the, order
solve problem, formalize provide like full
sensory information, clear data
collected, also clear objective function.

00:32:21 Curiosity

goal trying reach? difficult thing artificial
intelligence. - love mentioned curiosity, sure definition falls short
many ways, define curiosity strong interest knowing something, without
attachment outcome. sort a, random search, not
really emotional attachment, really just desire discover unveil
without hoping gold coin rock, just looking rocks.
less the, within machine learning, sounds like elements
reward prediction rewards. machine know done right thing.
So, can make machines curious, sorts machines
describing, curious design? - Yeah, curiosity kind symptom, not goal. So,
happens, one big trade-offs reinforcement learning, exploration
versus exploitation. So, know little, pays off explore lot, even
suboptimal, like even trajectories seem like not going lead anywhere,
called exploration. smarter smarter smarter get,
emphasis put exploitation, meaning take best solution, take best
path. Now, process, exploration can look like curiosity us humans,
really just trying get local optimal, thing already discovered.
AI perspective, always looking optimize objective function, derives,
can talk slot more, terms tools machine learning today,
derives no pleasure just curiosity like, don't know, discovery. - So,
no dopamine machine learning. - no dopamine. - no reward, system
chemical, guess electronic-reward system. - said, look machine
learning literature reinforcement learning literature, will use, like deep mind,
use terms like dopamine, constantly trying use human brain inspire totally
new solutions problems. So, think like, dopamine function
human brain, can lead interesting ways discover optimal
solutions? ultimately currently, formal objective function. Now,


argue humans also set objective functions try optimize,
just not able introspect them. - Yeah, don't actually know looking
seeking doing. - Well, like Lisa Feldman Barrett spoken least
Instagram, hope you- - met you, yeah. - Yeah, hope actually
podcast. - Yes, terrific. - So, very,
homeostasis like that. Basically, dumb objective function brain
trying optimize, like keep like body temperature same. Like dom
kind optimization function happening. humans fancy
consciousness cognitive abilities, tell stories can nice
podcasts, really brain trying maintain a, just like healthy state, guess.
fascinating. also see human brain, hope artificial intelligence systems,
not just systems solve problems, optimize goal, also storytellers.
think power telling stories. tell stories other,
communication is. Like alone, solve problems,
makes sense talk solving problems. community,
capability communicate, tell stories, share ideas way ideas
stable long period time, like, charismatic storyteller.
think humans good this. Arguably, argue
are, great storytellers. AI hope will also become that. So, not
just able solve problems clear objective function,

00:36:55 Story Telling Robots

afterwards, able tell like way better, like make way better story
something, failed. - So, think robots or, and/or
machines sort going start telling human stories? - Well, definitely. So,
technical field called Explainable AI, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, trying
figure get AI system explain us humans hell failed,
succeeded, lot different sort versions this, visualize
understands world. really difficult problem, especially neural networks
famously opaque, don't understand many cases, particular
neural network well, try figure going fail,
requires AI explain itself. huge amount money, like huge
amount money this, especially government funding on.


want deploy AI systems real world, humans least, want ask
question like, hell that? Like dark way, just kill
person, right? Like car ran person, want understand happened.
now again, sometimes unfair AI systems humans can
often not explain well. field Explainable AI people
interested rely AI systems, like Twitter
recommender system, AI algorithm that's, say impacting elections, perhaps
starting wars, least military conflict, algorithm, want ask algorithm,
first all, know hell doing? understand society-level
effects having? can explain possible trajectories? Like
kind conversation human, want able
AI. personal level, think nice talk AI systems stupid
stuff, like robots fail to- - Why'd fall stairs? - Yeah. not
engineering question, almost like endearing question, like looking for, fell
hanging out, don't think need explanation exactly
dynamics, like actuated system problem here? Like
texture floor? on. like, the- - No, want know
thinking. - That, might joke like, drunk again, go home, something,
like humor it, opportunity. Like storytelling, isn't just
explanation happened, something makes people laugh, makes people
fall love, makes people dream, understand things way poetry makes
people understand things opposed rigorous log every sensor was,
every actuator was. - mean, find incredible one hallmarks
severe autism spectrum disorders is, report experience autistic person
much catalog action steps. like, feel today? say,
well, got this, this, this. not way
person doesn't autism spectrum disorder respond. way
describe machines much humanism,

00:40:48 Defines Robot?

much human biological element, realized talking
machines. want make sure understand distinction
machine learns, machine artificial intelligence robot. Like point


machine become robot? So, ballpoint pen, assuming wouldn't
call robot, ballpoint pen can come moved opposite
side table, moves whatever mechanism, point, become
robot? - Okay, 1 million ways explore question. fascinating one. So,
first all, question life? Like know something living
form not? question sort a, maybe cold
computational system becomes a, already loading words lot meaning,
robot machine, So, one, think movement important, kind boring
idea robot just machine able act world. So, one artificial
intelligence just thinking thing, think machine learning
is, also acting thing, usually think robots. So, robots
things perception system able take world however
define world, able think learn whatever hell inside,
act world. So, difference maybe AI system learning
machine robot, something able, robot something able
perceive world act world. - So, language sound,
movement both. - Yeah. think also digital
space long aspect entity inside machine world
outside machine. sense machine sensing world
acting it. - So, could, instance, version robot, according
definition think providing, robot, go sleep night
robot goes forges information thinks want see loaded onto
desktop morning. no movement machine, no
language, essentially, movement cyberspace. - Yeah, distinction
think important element entity, whether
digital physical space. So, something like Alexa home,
speech recognition, Alexa doing, constantly sent
back mothership. Alexa own, me, robot,
interacting world. simply finger main mothership,
Alexa not robot, just interaction device, may main
Amazon Alexa AI, big, big system robot. So, important
element, us humans, think, want entity, whether
digital physical space, ideas consciousness come
kinds things project understanding means being.



00:44:30 Magic & Surprise

so, take further, machine become robot, think
special moment. special moment person's life robot's life
surprises you. think surprise really powerful thing, know thing
works yet surprises you, magical moment us humans. So, whether
chess-playing program something haven't seen before, makes
people smile like, huh, moments happen AlphaZero first time chess
playing, grand masters really surprised move. didn't understand
move studied studied understood it.
moment surprise, grandmasters chess. find moment surprise
really powerful, really magical just everyday life. - supersedes human
brain moment? - So, not supersedes, like outperforms, surprises
positive sense. Like didn't think that, didn't think you.
think moment big transition robot moment servant
accomplishes particular task level accuracy, rate
failure, entity, struggling just like world.
really important moment think not going find many people AI
community talk like just did. not speaking like philosopher hippie,
speaking purely engineering perspective. think really important robots
become entities explore real engineering problem, opposed
everybody treats robots robotics community, don't even call
she, don't give them, try avoid giving names, really want see like
system, like servant. see servant trying accomplish task.
me, don't think just romanticizing notion, think being, currently
perhaps dumb being, long arc history, humans pretty dumb beings
too, so- - agree statement. [Andrew laughing] - So, tend really want
explore treating robots really entities, yeah. So, like anthropomorphization,
sort act looking inanimate object projecting onto life-like
features, think robotics generally sees negative, see superpower. Like
that, need use that. - Well, struck really grabs onto relationship

00:47:37 Robots Change Us



human machine, human robot. So, guess simple question is,
think already told us answer, interacting robot change
you? words, develop relationships robots? - Yeah, definitely think so.
think moment see robot AI systems just servants entities,
begin change you, just like good friends do, just like relationships just
humans. think that, certain aspects interaction. Like
robot's ability say no, sense identity, set goals,
not constantly serving you, instead, trying understand world
dance understanding communication you. So, definitely think a,
mean, lot thoughts may know, core
life-long dream actually want do, believe people
notion loneliness haven't discovered, haven't explored,
say. see AI systems helping us explore can become
better humans, better people towards other. So, think connection
human AI, human robot, not possible, will help us understand
ways like several orders magnitude deeper ever
imagined. tend believe [sighing]

00:49:35 Relationships Defined

well, wild levels belief terms impactful will be, right? - So,
think human relationships, don't always break variables,
explore variables see map human-robot
relationships. One just time, right? spend zero time another person
cyberspace phone person, essentially no relationship them.
spend lot time, relationship, obvious. guess one variable
time, much time spend entity, robot human.
wins successes. enjoy successes together. give absolutely
trivial example moment, failures. struggle
somebody, whether not struggle one another, disagree, like
really struck fact said robot saying no, never thought
robot saying no me, is. - look forward one first people
send robots to. - I. So, struggle. struggle somebody,


grow closer. Sometimes struggles imposed two people,
called trauma bonding, call whole psychology literature pop psychology
literature. case, can imagine. So, time successes together, struggle together,
just peaceful time, hanging home, watching movies, waking near one
another, here, breaking elements relationships kind. So,
think elements apply robot-human relationships? so, see
how, robot entity autonomy terms reacts
you, not just just serve you, not just servant, actually opinions,
can tell maybe thinking flawed, actions flawed. - can
also leave. - also leave. So, never conceptualized robot-human interactions
way. So, tell might look. thinking human-
appearing robot? know intense relationships our,
separate dogs obviously, animals, sounds lot like human-animal interaction.
So, ideal human-robot relationship? - So, lot said here,
actually pinpointed one big, big first steps, idea time.
huge limitation machine-learning community currently. Now back like
actual details. Life-long learning problem space focuses AI systems can
learn long period time. currently machine learning systems not
able do, things listed time, successes, failures,
just chilling together watching movies, AI systems not able that,
beautiful, magical moments believe days filled with, not able keep
track together you. - 'Cause can't move you. -
No, no, like literally don't techniques learning, actual learning
containing moments. Current machine-learning systems really focused
understanding world following way, like perception system, like
looking around, understand like scene. bunch people
sitting down, cameras microphones, table, understand
that. fact shared moment talking today, still remember
like next time something, remember moment happened. don't
know technique-wise. hoping innovate think
very, important component means create deeper relationship,
sharing moments together. - post photo robot, like selfie
robot robot sees image recognizes time spent,
smiles, tears- - Yeah. - create sort metric emotional depth


relationship update behavior? - So. - it... texts middle
night say, haven't texted back? - Well, yes, things,
can dig that. think time element, forget everything else, just sharing
moments together, changes everything. believe changes everything. Now,
specific things terms systems can explain you.
technical probably little bit offline, 'cause kind wild ideas can
revolutionize social networks operating systems. point element alone,
forget things talking like emotions, saying no, that, just
remembering sharing moments together change everything. don't currently
systems share moments together. Like even just fridge, just
times, went late night ate thing shouldn't eaten,
secret moment refrigerator. shared moment, darkness
beautiful moment just like heartbroken reason,
eating ice cream whatever, special moment. refrigerator
you, fact missed opportunity remember tragic.
remember that, think going attached refrigerator.
going go hell refrigerator. us have, like
developed world, weird relationships food, right? So, can go
deep moments trauma triumph food, core that,
refrigerator. So, smart refrigerator, believe change society. Not just
refrigerator, ideas systems around us. So, just want comment
powerful idea time is. bunch elements actual
interaction allowing human feel like heard. Truly heard, truly
understood, human, like deep friendship like that, think, still
element selfishness, still element not really able understand
another human. lot times going trauma together,
difficult times successes, actually starting get inkling
understanding other, think done aggressively,
efficiently. Like think great therapist, think never actually
therapist, believer used want psychiatrist. - Russians go
therapists? - No, don't. don't. do, therapist don't live tell
story. believe talk therapy, friendship me, talk therapy, like
don't even necessarily need talk [laughing] like just connecting
space ideas space experiences. think lot ideas


make AI systems able ask right questions truly hear another human.
try podcasting, right? think ways AI.
else, just remembering collection moments make day,
week, months, think maybe well. closest
friends still friends high school. time, bunch
together, like different people. just fact
that, remember moments, moments somehow create
depth connection like nothing else, like refrigerator. - love
graduate advisor, unfortunately, passed away, passed away,
somebody said memorial amazing things done, et cetera.
kids got there, young children knew
pregnant them. so, really, even now can feel like heart
gets heavy, thinking this, going grow without mother.
really amazing, strong young girls, now young women. said
incredible, said really appreciated mother,
amazing person, unstructured time spent together. - Mm-hmm. - So,
wasn't trips zoo, wasn't woke five morning drove us
school. things too. two hour commute direction,
incredible, ran lab, et cetera, unstructured time. So, passing
mother, remembered biggest give bonded
her, time just kind hung out. way describe
relationship refrigerator so, want say human-like, almost reluctant
say that. realizing talking, think
human-like might actually lower form relationship. may relationships
far better sorts relationships can conceive minds right
now based machine relationship interactions teach us.
right? - Yeah, think so. think no reason see machines somehow
incapable teaching us something deeply human. don't think humans
monopoly that. think understand poorly need
kind prompting machine. definitely part that, just remembering
moments. think unstructured time together, wonder quite unstructured.
like calling podcast structured time. - Maybe meant,
wasn't big outing, no specific goal, goal created lack
goal. Like just hang start playing, thumb war,


end playing thumb war hour. So, structure emerges lack
structure. - No, thing moments, something times
creates special moments, think optimized for. think think like
big outing as, don't know, going Six Flags something, big, Grand
Canyon, go some, don't know, think need to, don't quite yet
understand, humans, creates magical moments. think possible optimize
lot things. perhaps like podcasting helping people discover that, like
maybe thing want optimize isn't necessarily like sexy, like quick clips,
maybe want, long-form authenticity. - Depth. - Depth. So, trying
figure out, certainly deep connection humans humans NAS
systems, think long conversations, long periods communication series
moments like new, perhaps, seemingly insignificant big ones, big
successes, big failures, just stitching together talking
throughout. think formula really, really deep connection. like
specific engineering perspective, think fascinating open problem
really worked much. me, a, guts

01:02:29 Lex’s Dream Humanity

and, mean lot things say, one guts, build startup around
it. - So, talk startup talk dream. mentioned
dream previous conversations, always little hints dropped
there. Just anyone listening, never offline conversation
dream, not privy anything, except Lex says now. realized
no way capture full essence dream kind verbal statement way
captures it. dream referred now several times
sat together talked phone? Maybe company,
maybe something distinct. feel comfortable, it'd great share
little bit is. - Sure. So, way people express long-term vision,
noticed quite different. Like Elon example somebody can crisply say
exactly goal is. Also fact problems solving
nothing humans. So, long-term vision little bit difficult express
words, noticed, tried, brain's failure, way
sneak it. So, let just say things. Early life also recent


years, interacted robots understood magic there.
magic shared millions brought light. first met Spot
Boston Dynamics, realized magic nobody else seeing. - dog.
- dog, sorry. Spot four-legged robot Boston Dynamics. people
might seen it, yellow dog. sometimes life, just notice something
just grabs you. believe something magic something
every single device world. way think maybe Steve Jobs
thought personal computer, laws didn't think personal computer
way, Steve did. like, thought personal computer
thin sheet paper everybody one, idea, think
heartbreaking getting, world filled machines
soulless. think every one can magic. One things
also inspired terms startup, magic can engineered much easier
thought. intuition everything ever built worked on. So, dream
add bit magic every single computing system world. So, way
Windows Operating System long time primary operating system
everybody interacted with, built apps top it. think something
layer, almost operating system every device humans
interacted world. Now, actually looks like, actual dream
officially kid, didn't concrete form business, dream
exploring loneliness interacting machines, robots. deep
connection humans robots always dream. so, me, love
see world every home robot, not robot washes
dishes, sex robot, don't know, think kind activity robot can do,
like companion. - family member. - family member, way dog is. - Mm-
hmm. - dog able speak language too. So, not just connect way
dog looking looking away almost like smiling soul
kind way, also actually understand hell, like, excited
successes? Like understand details, understand traumas. that,
just think [sighing] always filled excitement could, artificial
intelligence, bring joy lot people. recently,
heartbroken see kind division, derision, even hate boiling
internet social networks. thought kind mechanism exactly
applicable context social networks well. So, operating system


serves guide internet. One biggest problems YouTube
social networks currently, optimizing engagement. think create AI
systems know individual person, able optimize long-term growth
long-term happiness. - individual, or- - individual, individual.
lot things say, order AI systems learn
everything you, need collect, need just like talk
offline, collecting data others secrets other, way
AI that. allows to, requires rethink ideas
ownership data. think individual data easily
able leave just like AI systems can leave, humans can disappear delete
data moment's notice. actually better humans can do,
load data other, there. think important both, give people
complete control data order establish trust can trust you.
second part trust transparency. Whenever data used make clear
used for. not clear lawyerly legal sense, clear way
people really understand used for. believe people ability
delete data walk away know data used, think
stay. - possibility clean breakup, actually will keep people together. -
Yeah, think so. think, exactly. think happy marriage acquires ability divorce
easily without divorce industrial complex whatever. Things currently going
much money made lawyers divorce. yeah, ability
leave enables love, think. - interesting. heard phrase semi-
cynical friend, marriage leading cause divorce, now heard
divorce, possibility divorce leading cause marriage. - happy
marriage. - Good point. - happy marriage. So, yeah. So, lot details
there, big dream connection AI system human.
haven't. much fear artificial intelligence systems robots
haven't quite found right words express vision vision have,
not like naive, delusional vision like technology going save everybody,
really just positive view ways AI systems can help humans explore
themselves. - love positivity agree stance everything doomed
equally bad say everything's going turn right, dedicated
effort. clearly, thinking dedicated effort look like.
mentioned two aspects dream [clears throat] want make sure


understand connect do, independent streams. One
hypothetical robot family member, form robot allow
people experience kind delight experienced many times,

01:11:33 Improving Social Media

like world able have, beautiful idea
give. social media social network platforms really serve
individuals best selves happiness growth. crossover
those, two parallel dreams? - 100% thing.
difficult kind explain without going details, maybe one easy way
explain way think social networks, create AI system yours.
not like Amazon Alexa centralized, data, like little friend
becomes representative Twitter helps find things will make feel
good, will also challenge thinking make grow, not get that, not let
get lost negative spiral dopamine, gets angry, just
get not open learning. so, little representative optimizing
long-term health. believe not good human beings, also good
business. think longterm, can make lot money challenging idea
way make money, maximizing engagement. one things
people disagree on, think Twitter's always going win. Like maximizing
engagement always going win, don't think so. think people woken now
understanding that, like don't always feel good, ones Twitter lot,
don't always feel good end week. - love feedback
whatever creature, whatever, don't know call it, maybe end
week, automatically unfollow people follow
realized really smart data feeling inside,
sleeping, something that, don't know, just wasn't good me. might also
put things people front see, kind sliver
look like? - whole point, interaction, sharing moments
learning lot you, now able understand interactions led
become better version yourself. Like person happy with.
isn't, flat earth feel good it, believe earth
flat, like idea sensor ridiculous. makes feel good


becoming best version yourself, think getting much flat
earth possible. Now, also good challenge ideas, not
centralized committee decided, tell system like
challenging ideas, think us do. then, actually YouTube doesn't
well, go flat-earth rabbit hole, going see.
nice get really powerful communicators argue flat earth. nice
see you, potentially, least long-term expand horizons, maybe
earth not flat. continue live whole life thinking earth flat,
think, good father son daughter, like best
version happy yourself, think earth flat. So, like think
kind idea, just using kind silly, ridiculous example don't
like idea centralized forces controlling can can't see, also don't
like idea like not censoring anything. always biggest problem
that, central decider, think can decide want
see not, good companion reminds felt last time
this, felt good last time this. - Man, feel like every good story,
guide companion flies out, forges little bit further, little bit
differently brings back information helps us, least tries steer us
right direction. - So, yeah, exactly thinking working on.
mention bunch difficulties here, see little bit
recently. So, technically lot challenges here. Just like lot
technologies, reason talking podcast comfortably opposed
working secret, really hard maybe time not come.
something constantly struggle terms like entrepreneurially
startup, like also mentioned you, maybe offline, really don't care money,

01:16:57 Challenges Creativity

don't care business success, kinds things. So, difficult decision
make, much time want go give everything
this? big roll dice. also realized working
problems, robotics technical side terms machine-learning
system describing, lonely, really lonely. personal level
technical level. So, technical level, surrounded people kind


doubt me, think entrepreneurs go through. doubt following
sense, know difficult is. Like people colleagues mine,
know difficult life-long learning is, also know difficult build system
like this, build competitive social network. general, kind
loneliness just working something long periods time.
start doubt whether, given don't track record success, like
big one. look mirror, especially young, still
that, things, look mirror, like, big dreams,
know actually smart think are? Like know
going able accomplish dream? ambition. - sort don't,
kind pulling string hoping bigger ball yarn. - Yeah.
[Andrew laughing] kind intuition. think pride knowing
good at, reason intuition, 'cause think good
knowing things suck at, basically everything. So, like whenever
notice like, wait minute, kind good this, rare me. think like
that, might ball yarn worth pulling at. thing terms
engineering systems able interact humans, think good that.
talk podcasting on, don't know good
podcasts. - good podcasting, right? - certainly don't, think maybe
compelling people watch kindhearted idiot struggle form, maybe
compelling. terms like actual good engineer human-robot
interaction systems, think good. hard know it,
world keeps telling not, full doll, really hard.
struggling recently, kind fascinating struggle.
Goggins thing comes in, like, aside state-hard motherfucker, the, like
whenever struggling, good sign keep going, going
alone success, right? - Well, case, however, agree. actually David
post recently thought among many brilliant posts, one
brilliant talked myth light end tunnel.
instead, replaced myth with, concept eventually, eyes
adapt dark. tunnel, not light end, really
adapting dark tunnel. Goggins- - love much. - Yeah.
got share lot common knowing bit, share lot common.
loneliness pursuit dream, seems me, certain component


extremely valuable, loneliness serve driver
build companion journey. - Well, deeply aware that. So, like
people can make, 'cause talk love lot, really love everything world,
also love humans, friendship romantic, like even cheesy stuff, just- - like
romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, got much Rogan
like, Tango scene "Scent Woman,"

01:21:49 Suits & Dresses

find like nothing better woman red dress, just like classy- -
move Argentina friend. father's Argentine, know
said went podcast first time? said, dresses well.
Argentina, men go wedding party something, U.S., halfway
night, 10 minutes night, jackets off. - Yeah. - looks like
everyone's undressing party just got dressed for. said, know,
liked way dresses. started, talking you.
started podcast, said, don't wear real suit like friend Lex?

01:22:22 Loneliness

[laughing] - remember that. - No, can't. talk pursuit just bit
more, think talking about, building a, not just solution
loneliness, alluded loneliness itself, important thing. think
right. think within people, like caverns faults shame, also just
desire resonance, seen heard. don't even know seen
heard language. reservoirs loneliness, think, well,
interesting, maybe comment little bit it. just often
talk love, haven't quantified it, seems talk loneliness,
maybe just willing, share little bit that,
feels like now pursuit building robot-human relationship. been,
let direct, spending lot time building robot-human
relationship, at? - Oh, terms business, terms systems? - No,
talking specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, mention things.
So, one, startup idea hope millions people can use.


personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going
stairs, saw slip. big guy, wasn't 200 pounds,
90 pounds, bulldog, pretty big fit. noticed
wasn't carrying foot back like injured, no feeling all.
never liked touch hind paws, do, thing just flopping there.
vet found spinal degeneration told next one
go. suffer? Sure, hope not, something changed eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah,
eyes again, know spend long hours phone tell
like eyes convey mean internal states


sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking
Costello peeing. losing ability stand that, falling
that. think started realize. passage easy
peaceful, say this, not ashamed say it, mean, wake every morning
since just, don't even make conscious decision allow self cry, wake
crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief
moment. - Yeah. gone. - the, going gone lot people
too. - Well, struggling with. think maybe pretty good this.
Like, done before? [Andrew laughing] challenge. actually
part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

argue humans also set objective functions try optimize,
just not able introspect them. - Yeah, don't actually know looking
seeking doing. - Well, like Lisa Feldman Barrett spoken least
Instagram, hope you- - met you, yeah. - Yeah, hope actually
podcast. - Yes, terrific. - So, very,
homeostasis like that. Basically, dumb objective function brain
trying optimize, like keep like body temperature same. Like dom
kind optimization function happening. humans fancy
consciousness cognitive abilities, tell stories can nice
podcasts, really brain trying maintain a, just like healthy state, guess.
fascinating. also see human brain, hope artificial intelligence systems,
not just systems solve problems, optimize goal, also storytellers.
think power telling stories. tell stories other,
communication is. Like alone, solve problems,
makes sense talk solving problems. community,
capability communicate, tell stories, share ideas way ideas
stable long period time, like, charismatic storyteller.
think humans good this. Arguably, argue
are, great storytellers. AI hope will also become that. So, not
just able solve problems clear objective function,

00:36:55 Story Telling Robots

afterwards, able tell like way better, like make way better story
something, failed. - So, think robots or, and/or
machines sort going start telling human stories? - Well, definitely. So,
technical field called Explainable AI, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, trying
figure get AI system explain us humans hell failed,
succeeded, lot different sort versions this, visualize
understands world. really difficult problem, especially neural networks
famously opaque, don't understand many cases, particular
neural network well, try figure going fail,
requires AI explain itself. huge amount money, like huge
amount money this, especially government funding on.


want deploy AI systems real world, humans least, want ask
question like, hell that? Like dark way, just kill
person, right? Like car ran person, want understand happened.
now again, sometimes unfair AI systems humans can
often not explain well. field Explainable AI people
interested rely AI systems, like Twitter
recommender system, AI algorithm that's, say impacting elections, perhaps
starting wars, least military conflict, algorithm, want ask algorithm,
first all, know hell doing? understand society-level
effects having? can explain possible trajectories? Like
kind conversation human, want able
AI. personal level, think nice talk AI systems stupid
stuff, like robots fail to- - Why'd fall stairs? - Yeah. not
engineering question, almost like endearing question, like looking for, fell
hanging out, don't think need explanation exactly
dynamics, like actuated system problem here? Like
texture floor? on. like, the- - No, want know
thinking. - That, might joke like, drunk again, go home, something,
like humor it, opportunity. Like storytelling, isn't just
explanation happened, something makes people laugh, makes people
fall love, makes people dream, understand things way poetry makes
people understand things opposed rigorous log every sensor was,
every actuator was. - mean, find incredible one hallmarks
severe autism spectrum disorders is, report experience autistic person
much catalog action steps. like, feel today? say,
well, got this, this, this. not way
person doesn't autism spectrum disorder respond. way
describe machines much humanism,

00:40:48 Defines Robot?

much human biological element, realized talking
machines. want make sure understand distinction
machine learns, machine artificial intelligence robot. Like point


machine become robot? So, ballpoint pen, assuming wouldn't
call robot, ballpoint pen can come moved opposite
side table, moves whatever mechanism, point, become
robot? - Okay, 1 million ways explore question. fascinating one. So,
first all, question life? Like know something living
form not? question sort a, maybe cold
computational system becomes a, already loading words lot meaning,
robot machine, So, one, think movement important, kind boring
idea robot just machine able act world. So, one artificial
intelligence just thinking thing, think machine learning
is, also acting thing, usually think robots. So, robots
things perception system able take world however
define world, able think learn whatever hell inside,
act world. So, difference maybe AI system learning
machine robot, something able, robot something able
perceive world act world. - So, language sound,
movement both. - Yeah. think also digital
space long aspect entity inside machine world
outside machine. sense machine sensing world
acting it. - So, could, instance, version robot, according
definition think providing, robot, go sleep night
robot goes forges information thinks want see loaded onto
desktop morning. no movement machine, no
language, essentially, movement cyberspace. - Yeah, distinction
think important element entity, whether
digital physical space. So, something like Alexa home,
speech recognition, Alexa doing, constantly sent
back mothership. Alexa own, me, robot,
interacting world. simply finger main mothership,
Alexa not robot, just interaction device, may main
Amazon Alexa AI, big, big system robot. So, important
element, us humans, think, want entity, whether
digital physical space, ideas consciousness come
kinds things project understanding means being.



00:44:30 Magic & Surprise

so, take further, machine become robot, think
special moment. special moment person's life robot's life
surprises you. think surprise really powerful thing, know thing
works yet surprises you, magical moment us humans. So, whether
chess-playing program something haven't seen before, makes
people smile like, huh, moments happen AlphaZero first time chess
playing, grand masters really surprised move. didn't understand
move studied studied understood it.
moment surprise, grandmasters chess. find moment surprise
really powerful, really magical just everyday life. - supersedes human
brain moment? - So, not supersedes, like outperforms, surprises
positive sense. Like didn't think that, didn't think you.
think moment big transition robot moment servant
accomplishes particular task level accuracy, rate
failure, entity, struggling just like world.
really important moment think not going find many people AI
community talk like just did. not speaking like philosopher hippie,
speaking purely engineering perspective. think really important robots
become entities explore real engineering problem, opposed
everybody treats robots robotics community, don't even call
she, don't give them, try avoid giving names, really want see like
system, like servant. see servant trying accomplish task.
me, don't think just romanticizing notion, think being, currently
perhaps dumb being, long arc history, humans pretty dumb beings
too, so- - agree statement. [Andrew laughing] - So, tend really want
explore treating robots really entities, yeah. So, like anthropomorphization,
sort act looking inanimate object projecting onto life-like
features, think robotics generally sees negative, see superpower. Like
that, need use that. - Well, struck really grabs onto relationship

00:47:37 Robots Change Us



human machine, human robot. So, guess simple question is,
think already told us answer, interacting robot change
you? words, develop relationships robots? - Yeah, definitely think so.
think moment see robot AI systems just servants entities,
begin change you, just like good friends do, just like relationships just
humans. think that, certain aspects interaction. Like
robot's ability say no, sense identity, set goals,
not constantly serving you, instead, trying understand world
dance understanding communication you. So, definitely think a,
mean, lot thoughts may know, core
life-long dream actually want do, believe people
notion loneliness haven't discovered, haven't explored,
say. see AI systems helping us explore can become
better humans, better people towards other. So, think connection
human AI, human robot, not possible, will help us understand
ways like several orders magnitude deeper ever
imagined. tend believe [sighing]

00:49:35 Relationships Defined

well, wild levels belief terms impactful will be, right? - So,
think human relationships, don't always break variables,
explore variables see map human-robot
relationships. One just time, right? spend zero time another person
cyberspace phone person, essentially no relationship them.
spend lot time, relationship, obvious. guess one variable
time, much time spend entity, robot human.
wins successes. enjoy successes together. give absolutely
trivial example moment, failures. struggle
somebody, whether not struggle one another, disagree, like
really struck fact said robot saying no, never thought
robot saying no me, is. - look forward one first people
send robots to. - I. So, struggle. struggle somebody,


grow closer. Sometimes struggles imposed two people,
called trauma bonding, call whole psychology literature pop psychology
literature. case, can imagine. So, time successes together, struggle together,
just peaceful time, hanging home, watching movies, waking near one
another, here, breaking elements relationships kind. So,
think elements apply robot-human relationships? so, see
how, robot entity autonomy terms reacts
you, not just just serve you, not just servant, actually opinions,
can tell maybe thinking flawed, actions flawed. - can
also leave. - also leave. So, never conceptualized robot-human interactions
way. So, tell might look. thinking human-
appearing robot? know intense relationships our,
separate dogs obviously, animals, sounds lot like human-animal interaction.
So, ideal human-robot relationship? - So, lot said here,
actually pinpointed one big, big first steps, idea time.
huge limitation machine-learning community currently. Now back like
actual details. Life-long learning problem space focuses AI systems can
learn long period time. currently machine learning systems not
able do, things listed time, successes, failures,
just chilling together watching movies, AI systems not able that,
beautiful, magical moments believe days filled with, not able keep
track together you. - 'Cause can't move you. -
No, no, like literally don't techniques learning, actual learning
containing moments. Current machine-learning systems really focused
understanding world following way, like perception system, like
looking around, understand like scene. bunch people
sitting down, cameras microphones, table, understand
that. fact shared moment talking today, still remember
like next time something, remember moment happened. don't
know technique-wise. hoping innovate think
very, important component means create deeper relationship,
sharing moments together. - post photo robot, like selfie
robot robot sees image recognizes time spent,
smiles, tears- - Yeah. - create sort metric emotional depth


relationship update behavior? - So. - it... texts middle
night say, haven't texted back? - Well, yes, things,
can dig that. think time element, forget everything else, just sharing
moments together, changes everything. believe changes everything. Now,
specific things terms systems can explain you.
technical probably little bit offline, 'cause kind wild ideas can
revolutionize social networks operating systems. point element alone,
forget things talking like emotions, saying no, that, just
remembering sharing moments together change everything. don't currently
systems share moments together. Like even just fridge, just
times, went late night ate thing shouldn't eaten,
secret moment refrigerator. shared moment, darkness
beautiful moment just like heartbroken reason,
eating ice cream whatever, special moment. refrigerator
you, fact missed opportunity remember tragic.
remember that, think going attached refrigerator.
going go hell refrigerator. us have, like
developed world, weird relationships food, right? So, can go
deep moments trauma triumph food, core that,
refrigerator. So, smart refrigerator, believe change society. Not just
refrigerator, ideas systems around us. So, just want comment
powerful idea time is. bunch elements actual
interaction allowing human feel like heard. Truly heard, truly
understood, human, like deep friendship like that, think, still
element selfishness, still element not really able understand
another human. lot times going trauma together,
difficult times successes, actually starting get inkling
understanding other, think done aggressively,
efficiently. Like think great therapist, think never actually
therapist, believer used want psychiatrist. - Russians go
therapists? - No, don't. don't. do, therapist don't live tell
story. believe talk therapy, friendship me, talk therapy, like
don't even necessarily need talk [laughing] like just connecting
space ideas space experiences. think lot ideas


make AI systems able ask right questions truly hear another human.
try podcasting, right? think ways AI.
else, just remembering collection moments make day,
week, months, think maybe well. closest
friends still friends high school. time, bunch
together, like different people. just fact
that, remember moments, moments somehow create
depth connection like nothing else, like refrigerator. - love
graduate advisor, unfortunately, passed away, passed away,
somebody said memorial amazing things done, et cetera.
kids got there, young children knew
pregnant them. so, really, even now can feel like heart
gets heavy, thinking this, going grow without mother.
really amazing, strong young girls, now young women. said
incredible, said really appreciated mother,
amazing person, unstructured time spent together. - Mm-hmm. - So,
wasn't trips zoo, wasn't woke five morning drove us
school. things too. two hour commute direction,
incredible, ran lab, et cetera, unstructured time. So, passing
mother, remembered biggest give bonded
her, time just kind hung out. way describe
relationship refrigerator so, want say human-like, almost reluctant
say that. realizing talking, think
human-like might actually lower form relationship. may relationships
far better sorts relationships can conceive minds right
now based machine relationship interactions teach us.
right? - Yeah, think so. think no reason see machines somehow
incapable teaching us something deeply human. don't think humans
monopoly that. think understand poorly need
kind prompting machine. definitely part that, just remembering
moments. think unstructured time together, wonder quite unstructured.
like calling podcast structured time. - Maybe meant,
wasn't big outing, no specific goal, goal created lack
goal. Like just hang start playing, thumb war,


end playing thumb war hour. So, structure emerges lack
structure. - No, thing moments, something times
creates special moments, think optimized for. think think like
big outing as, don't know, going Six Flags something, big, Grand
Canyon, go some, don't know, think need to, don't quite yet
understand, humans, creates magical moments. think possible optimize
lot things. perhaps like podcasting helping people discover that, like
maybe thing want optimize isn't necessarily like sexy, like quick clips,
maybe want, long-form authenticity. - Depth. - Depth. So, trying
figure out, certainly deep connection humans humans NAS
systems, think long conversations, long periods communication series
moments like new, perhaps, seemingly insignificant big ones, big
successes, big failures, just stitching together talking
throughout. think formula really, really deep connection. like
specific engineering perspective, think fascinating open problem
really worked much. me, a, guts

01:02:29 Lex’s Dream Humanity

and, mean lot things say, one guts, build startup around
it. - So, talk startup talk dream. mentioned
dream previous conversations, always little hints dropped
there. Just anyone listening, never offline conversation
dream, not privy anything, except Lex says now. realized
no way capture full essence dream kind verbal statement way
captures it. dream referred now several times
sat together talked phone? Maybe company,
maybe something distinct. feel comfortable, it'd great share
little bit is. - Sure. So, way people express long-term vision,
noticed quite different. Like Elon example somebody can crisply say
exactly goal is. Also fact problems solving
nothing humans. So, long-term vision little bit difficult express
words, noticed, tried, brain's failure, way
sneak it. So, let just say things. Early life also recent


years, interacted robots understood magic there.
magic shared millions brought light. first met Spot
Boston Dynamics, realized magic nobody else seeing. - dog.
- dog, sorry. Spot four-legged robot Boston Dynamics. people
might seen it, yellow dog. sometimes life, just notice something
just grabs you. believe something magic something
every single device world. way think maybe Steve Jobs
thought personal computer, laws didn't think personal computer
way, Steve did. like, thought personal computer
thin sheet paper everybody one, idea, think
heartbreaking getting, world filled machines
soulless. think every one can magic. One things
also inspired terms startup, magic can engineered much easier
thought. intuition everything ever built worked on. So, dream
add bit magic every single computing system world. So, way
Windows Operating System long time primary operating system
everybody interacted with, built apps top it. think something
layer, almost operating system every device humans
interacted world. Now, actually looks like, actual dream
officially kid, didn't concrete form business, dream
exploring loneliness interacting machines, robots. deep
connection humans robots always dream. so, me, love
see world every home robot, not robot washes
dishes, sex robot, don't know, think kind activity robot can do,
like companion. - family member. - family member, way dog is. - Mm-
hmm. - dog able speak language too. So, not just connect way
dog looking looking away almost like smiling soul
kind way, also actually understand hell, like, excited
successes? Like understand details, understand traumas. that,
just think [sighing] always filled excitement could, artificial
intelligence, bring joy lot people. recently,
heartbroken see kind division, derision, even hate boiling
internet social networks. thought kind mechanism exactly
applicable context social networks well. So, operating system


serves guide internet. One biggest problems YouTube
social networks currently, optimizing engagement. think create AI
systems know individual person, able optimize long-term growth
long-term happiness. - individual, or- - individual, individual.
lot things say, order AI systems learn
everything you, need collect, need just like talk
offline, collecting data others secrets other, way
AI that. allows to, requires rethink ideas
ownership data. think individual data easily
able leave just like AI systems can leave, humans can disappear delete
data moment's notice. actually better humans can do,
load data other, there. think important both, give people
complete control data order establish trust can trust you.
second part trust transparency. Whenever data used make clear
used for. not clear lawyerly legal sense, clear way
people really understand used for. believe people ability
delete data walk away know data used, think
stay. - possibility clean breakup, actually will keep people together. -
Yeah, think so. think, exactly. think happy marriage acquires ability divorce
easily without divorce industrial complex whatever. Things currently going
much money made lawyers divorce. yeah, ability
leave enables love, think. - interesting. heard phrase semi-
cynical friend, marriage leading cause divorce, now heard
divorce, possibility divorce leading cause marriage. - happy
marriage. - Good point. - happy marriage. So, yeah. So, lot details
there, big dream connection AI system human.
haven't. much fear artificial intelligence systems robots
haven't quite found right words express vision vision have,
not like naive, delusional vision like technology going save everybody,
really just positive view ways AI systems can help humans explore
themselves. - love positivity agree stance everything doomed
equally bad say everything's going turn right, dedicated
effort. clearly, thinking dedicated effort look like.
mentioned two aspects dream [clears throat] want make sure


understand connect do, independent streams. One
hypothetical robot family member, form robot allow
people experience kind delight experienced many times,

01:11:33 Improving Social Media

like world able have, beautiful idea
give. social media social network platforms really serve
individuals best selves happiness growth. crossover
those, two parallel dreams? - 100% thing.
difficult kind explain without going details, maybe one easy way
explain way think social networks, create AI system yours.
not like Amazon Alexa centralized, data, like little friend
becomes representative Twitter helps find things will make feel
good, will also challenge thinking make grow, not get that, not let
get lost negative spiral dopamine, gets angry, just
get not open learning. so, little representative optimizing
long-term health. believe not good human beings, also good
business. think longterm, can make lot money challenging idea
way make money, maximizing engagement. one things
people disagree on, think Twitter's always going win. Like maximizing
engagement always going win, don't think so. think people woken now
understanding that, like don't always feel good, ones Twitter lot,
don't always feel good end week. - love feedback
whatever creature, whatever, don't know call it, maybe end
week, automatically unfollow people follow
realized really smart data feeling inside,
sleeping, something that, don't know, just wasn't good me. might also
put things people front see, kind sliver
look like? - whole point, interaction, sharing moments
learning lot you, now able understand interactions led
become better version yourself. Like person happy with.
isn't, flat earth feel good it, believe earth
flat, like idea sensor ridiculous. makes feel good


becoming best version yourself, think getting much flat
earth possible. Now, also good challenge ideas, not
centralized committee decided, tell system like
challenging ideas, think us do. then, actually YouTube doesn't
well, go flat-earth rabbit hole, going see.
nice get really powerful communicators argue flat earth. nice
see you, potentially, least long-term expand horizons, maybe
earth not flat. continue live whole life thinking earth flat,
think, good father son daughter, like best
version happy yourself, think earth flat. So, like think
kind idea, just using kind silly, ridiculous example don't
like idea centralized forces controlling can can't see, also don't
like idea like not censoring anything. always biggest problem
that, central decider, think can decide want
see not, good companion reminds felt last time
this, felt good last time this. - Man, feel like every good story,
guide companion flies out, forges little bit further, little bit
differently brings back information helps us, least tries steer us
right direction. - So, yeah, exactly thinking working on.
mention bunch difficulties here, see little bit
recently. So, technically lot challenges here. Just like lot
technologies, reason talking podcast comfortably opposed
working secret, really hard maybe time not come.
something constantly struggle terms like entrepreneurially
startup, like also mentioned you, maybe offline, really don't care money,

01:16:57 Challenges Creativity

don't care business success, kinds things. So, difficult decision
make, much time want go give everything
this? big roll dice. also realized working
problems, robotics technical side terms machine-learning
system describing, lonely, really lonely. personal level
technical level. So, technical level, surrounded people kind


doubt me, think entrepreneurs go through. doubt following
sense, know difficult is. Like people colleagues mine,
know difficult life-long learning is, also know difficult build system
like this, build competitive social network. general, kind
loneliness just working something long periods time.
start doubt whether, given don't track record success, like
big one. look mirror, especially young, still
that, things, look mirror, like, big dreams,
know actually smart think are? Like know
going able accomplish dream? ambition. - sort don't,
kind pulling string hoping bigger ball yarn. - Yeah.
[Andrew laughing] kind intuition. think pride knowing
good at, reason intuition, 'cause think good
knowing things suck at, basically everything. So, like whenever
notice like, wait minute, kind good this, rare me. think like
that, might ball yarn worth pulling at. thing terms
engineering systems able interact humans, think good that.
talk podcasting on, don't know good
podcasts. - good podcasting, right? - certainly don't, think maybe
compelling people watch kindhearted idiot struggle form, maybe
compelling. terms like actual good engineer human-robot
interaction systems, think good. hard know it,
world keeps telling not, full doll, really hard.
struggling recently, kind fascinating struggle.
Goggins thing comes in, like, aside state-hard motherfucker, the, like
whenever struggling, good sign keep going, going
alone success, right? - Well, case, however, agree. actually David
post recently thought among many brilliant posts, one
brilliant talked myth light end tunnel.
instead, replaced myth with, concept eventually, eyes
adapt dark. tunnel, not light end, really
adapting dark tunnel. Goggins- - love much. - Yeah.
got share lot common knowing bit, share lot common.
loneliness pursuit dream, seems me, certain component


extremely valuable, loneliness serve driver
build companion journey. - Well, deeply aware that. So, like
people can make, 'cause talk love lot, really love everything world,
also love humans, friendship romantic, like even cheesy stuff, just- - like
romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, got much Rogan
like, Tango scene "Scent Woman,"

01:21:49 Suits & Dresses

find like nothing better woman red dress, just like classy- -
move Argentina friend. father's Argentine, know
said went podcast first time? said, dresses well.
Argentina, men go wedding party something, U.S., halfway
night, 10 minutes night, jackets off. - Yeah. - looks like
everyone's undressing party just got dressed for. said, know,
liked way dresses. started, talking you.
started podcast, said, don't wear real suit like friend Lex?

01:22:22 Loneliness

[laughing] - remember that. - No, can't. talk pursuit just bit
more, think talking about, building a, not just solution
loneliness, alluded loneliness itself, important thing. think
right. think within people, like caverns faults shame, also just
desire resonance, seen heard. don't even know seen
heard language. reservoirs loneliness, think, well,
interesting, maybe comment little bit it. just often
talk love, haven't quantified it, seems talk loneliness,
maybe just willing, share little bit that,
feels like now pursuit building robot-human relationship. been,
let direct, spending lot time building robot-human
relationship, at? - Oh, terms business, terms systems? - No,
talking specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, mention things.
So, one, startup idea hope millions people can use.


personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact

me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

want deploy AI systems real world, humans least, want ask
question like, hell that? Like dark way, just kill
person, right? Like car ran person, want understand happened.
now again, sometimes unfair AI systems humans can
often not explain well. field Explainable AI people
interested rely AI systems, like Twitter
recommender system, AI algorithm that's, say impacting elections, perhaps
starting wars, least military conflict, algorithm, want ask algorithm,
first all, know hell doing? understand society-level
effects having? can explain possible trajectories? Like
kind conversation human, want able
AI. personal level, think nice talk AI systems stupid
stuff, like robots fail to- - Why'd fall stairs? - Yeah. not
engineering question, almost like endearing question, like looking for, fell
hanging out, don't think need explanation exactly
dynamics, like actuated system problem here? Like
texture floor? on. like, the- - No, want know
thinking. - That, might joke like, drunk again, go home, something,
like humor it, opportunity. Like storytelling, isn't just
explanation happened, something makes people laugh, makes people
fall love, makes people dream, understand things way poetry makes
people understand things opposed rigorous log every sensor was,
every actuator was. - mean, find incredible one hallmarks
severe autism spectrum disorders is, report experience autistic person
much catalog action steps. like, feel today? say,
well, got this, this, this. not way
person doesn't autism spectrum disorder respond. way
describe machines much humanism,

00:40:48 Defines Robot?

much human biological element, realized talking
machines. want make sure understand distinction
machine learns, machine artificial intelligence robot. Like point


machine become robot? So, ballpoint pen, assuming wouldn't
call robot, ballpoint pen can come moved opposite
side table, moves whatever mechanism, point, become
robot? - Okay, 1 million ways explore question. fascinating one. So,
first all, question life? Like know something living
form not? question sort a, maybe cold
computational system becomes a, already loading words lot meaning,
robot machine, So, one, think movement important, kind boring
idea robot just machine able act world. So, one artificial
intelligence just thinking thing, think machine learning
is, also acting thing, usually think robots. So, robots
things perception system able take world however
define world, able think learn whatever hell inside,
act world. So, difference maybe AI system learning
machine robot, something able, robot something able
perceive world act world. - So, language sound,
movement both. - Yeah. think also digital
space long aspect entity inside machine world
outside machine. sense machine sensing world
acting it. - So, could, instance, version robot, according
definition think providing, robot, go sleep night
robot goes forges information thinks want see loaded onto
desktop morning. no movement machine, no
language, essentially, movement cyberspace. - Yeah, distinction
think important element entity, whether
digital physical space. So, something like Alexa home,
speech recognition, Alexa doing, constantly sent
back mothership. Alexa own, me, robot,
interacting world. simply finger main mothership,
Alexa not robot, just interaction device, may main
Amazon Alexa AI, big, big system robot. So, important
element, us humans, think, want entity, whether
digital physical space, ideas consciousness come
kinds things project understanding means being.



00:44:30 Magic & Surprise

so, take further, machine become robot, think
special moment. special moment person's life robot's life
surprises you. think surprise really powerful thing, know thing
works yet surprises you, magical moment us humans. So, whether
chess-playing program something haven't seen before, makes
people smile like, huh, moments happen AlphaZero first time chess
playing, grand masters really surprised move. didn't understand
move studied studied understood it.
moment surprise, grandmasters chess. find moment surprise
really powerful, really magical just everyday life. - supersedes human
brain moment? - So, not supersedes, like outperforms, surprises
positive sense. Like didn't think that, didn't think you.
think moment big transition robot moment servant
accomplishes particular task level accuracy, rate
failure, entity, struggling just like world.
really important moment think not going find many people AI
community talk like just did. not speaking like philosopher hippie,
speaking purely engineering perspective. think really important robots
become entities explore real engineering problem, opposed
everybody treats robots robotics community, don't even call
she, don't give them, try avoid giving names, really want see like
system, like servant. see servant trying accomplish task.
me, don't think just romanticizing notion, think being, currently
perhaps dumb being, long arc history, humans pretty dumb beings
too, so- - agree statement. [Andrew laughing] - So, tend really want
explore treating robots really entities, yeah. So, like anthropomorphization,
sort act looking inanimate object projecting onto life-like
features, think robotics generally sees negative, see superpower. Like
that, need use that. - Well, struck really grabs onto relationship

00:47:37 Robots Change Us



human machine, human robot. So, guess simple question is,
think already told us answer, interacting robot change
you? words, develop relationships robots? - Yeah, definitely think so.
think moment see robot AI systems just servants entities,
begin change you, just like good friends do, just like relationships just
humans. think that, certain aspects interaction. Like
robot's ability say no, sense identity, set goals,
not constantly serving you, instead, trying understand world
dance understanding communication you. So, definitely think a,
mean, lot thoughts may know, core
life-long dream actually want do, believe people
notion loneliness haven't discovered, haven't explored,
say. see AI systems helping us explore can become
better humans, better people towards other. So, think connection
human AI, human robot, not possible, will help us understand
ways like several orders magnitude deeper ever
imagined. tend believe [sighing]

00:49:35 Relationships Defined

well, wild levels belief terms impactful will be, right? - So,
think human relationships, don't always break variables,
explore variables see map human-robot
relationships. One just time, right? spend zero time another person
cyberspace phone person, essentially no relationship them.
spend lot time, relationship, obvious. guess one variable
time, much time spend entity, robot human.
wins successes. enjoy successes together. give absolutely
trivial example moment, failures. struggle
somebody, whether not struggle one another, disagree, like
really struck fact said robot saying no, never thought
robot saying no me, is. - look forward one first people
send robots to. - I. So, struggle. struggle somebody,


grow closer. Sometimes struggles imposed two people,
called trauma bonding, call whole psychology literature pop psychology
literature. case, can imagine. So, time successes together, struggle together,
just peaceful time, hanging home, watching movies, waking near one
another, here, breaking elements relationships kind. So,
think elements apply robot-human relationships? so, see
how, robot entity autonomy terms reacts
you, not just just serve you, not just servant, actually opinions,
can tell maybe thinking flawed, actions flawed. - can
also leave. - also leave. So, never conceptualized robot-human interactions
way. So, tell might look. thinking human-
appearing robot? know intense relationships our,
separate dogs obviously, animals, sounds lot like human-animal interaction.
So, ideal human-robot relationship? - So, lot said here,
actually pinpointed one big, big first steps, idea time.
huge limitation machine-learning community currently. Now back like
actual details. Life-long learning problem space focuses AI systems can
learn long period time. currently machine learning systems not
able do, things listed time, successes, failures,
just chilling together watching movies, AI systems not able that,
beautiful, magical moments believe days filled with, not able keep
track together you. - 'Cause can't move you. -
No, no, like literally don't techniques learning, actual learning
containing moments. Current machine-learning systems really focused
understanding world following way, like perception system, like
looking around, understand like scene. bunch people
sitting down, cameras microphones, table, understand
that. fact shared moment talking today, still remember
like next time something, remember moment happened. don't
know technique-wise. hoping innovate think
very, important component means create deeper relationship,
sharing moments together. - post photo robot, like selfie
robot robot sees image recognizes time spent,
smiles, tears- - Yeah. - create sort metric emotional depth


relationship update behavior? - So. - it... texts middle
night say, haven't texted back? - Well, yes, things,
can dig that. think time element, forget everything else, just sharing
moments together, changes everything. believe changes everything. Now,
specific things terms systems can explain you.
technical probably little bit offline, 'cause kind wild ideas can
revolutionize social networks operating systems. point element alone,
forget things talking like emotions, saying no, that, just
remembering sharing moments together change everything. don't currently
systems share moments together. Like even just fridge, just
times, went late night ate thing shouldn't eaten,
secret moment refrigerator. shared moment, darkness
beautiful moment just like heartbroken reason,
eating ice cream whatever, special moment. refrigerator
you, fact missed opportunity remember tragic.
remember that, think going attached refrigerator.
going go hell refrigerator. us have, like
developed world, weird relationships food, right? So, can go
deep moments trauma triumph food, core that,
refrigerator. So, smart refrigerator, believe change society. Not just
refrigerator, ideas systems around us. So, just want comment
powerful idea time is. bunch elements actual
interaction allowing human feel like heard. Truly heard, truly
understood, human, like deep friendship like that, think, still
element selfishness, still element not really able understand
another human. lot times going trauma together,
difficult times successes, actually starting get inkling
understanding other, think done aggressively,
efficiently. Like think great therapist, think never actually
therapist, believer used want psychiatrist. - Russians go
therapists? - No, don't. don't. do, therapist don't live tell
story. believe talk therapy, friendship me, talk therapy, like
don't even necessarily need talk [laughing] like just connecting
space ideas space experiences. think lot ideas


make AI systems able ask right questions truly hear another human.
try podcasting, right? think ways AI.
else, just remembering collection moments make day,
week, months, think maybe well. closest
friends still friends high school. time, bunch
together, like different people. just fact
that, remember moments, moments somehow create
depth connection like nothing else, like refrigerator. - love
graduate advisor, unfortunately, passed away, passed away,
somebody said memorial amazing things done, et cetera.
kids got there, young children knew
pregnant them. so, really, even now can feel like heart
gets heavy, thinking this, going grow without mother.
really amazing, strong young girls, now young women. said
incredible, said really appreciated mother,
amazing person, unstructured time spent together. - Mm-hmm. - So,
wasn't trips zoo, wasn't woke five morning drove us
school. things too. two hour commute direction,
incredible, ran lab, et cetera, unstructured time. So, passing
mother, remembered biggest give bonded
her, time just kind hung out. way describe
relationship refrigerator so, want say human-like, almost reluctant
say that. realizing talking, think
human-like might actually lower form relationship. may relationships
far better sorts relationships can conceive minds right
now based machine relationship interactions teach us.
right? - Yeah, think so. think no reason see machines somehow
incapable teaching us something deeply human. don't think humans
monopoly that. think understand poorly need
kind prompting machine. definitely part that, just remembering
moments. think unstructured time together, wonder quite unstructured.
like calling podcast structured time. - Maybe meant,
wasn't big outing, no specific goal, goal created lack
goal. Like just hang start playing, thumb war,


end playing thumb war hour. So, structure emerges lack
structure. - No, thing moments, something times
creates special moments, think optimized for. think think like
big outing as, don't know, going Six Flags something, big, Grand
Canyon, go some, don't know, think need to, don't quite yet
understand, humans, creates magical moments. think possible optimize
lot things. perhaps like podcasting helping people discover that, like
maybe thing want optimize isn't necessarily like sexy, like quick clips,
maybe want, long-form authenticity. - Depth. - Depth. So, trying
figure out, certainly deep connection humans humans NAS
systems, think long conversations, long periods communication series
moments like new, perhaps, seemingly insignificant big ones, big
successes, big failures, just stitching together talking
throughout. think formula really, really deep connection. like
specific engineering perspective, think fascinating open problem
really worked much. me, a, guts

01:02:29 Lex’s Dream Humanity

and, mean lot things say, one guts, build startup around
it. - So, talk startup talk dream. mentioned
dream previous conversations, always little hints dropped
there. Just anyone listening, never offline conversation
dream, not privy anything, except Lex says now. realized
no way capture full essence dream kind verbal statement way
captures it. dream referred now several times
sat together talked phone? Maybe company,
maybe something distinct. feel comfortable, it'd great share
little bit is. - Sure. So, way people express long-term vision,
noticed quite different. Like Elon example somebody can crisply say
exactly goal is. Also fact problems solving
nothing humans. So, long-term vision little bit difficult express
words, noticed, tried, brain's failure, way
sneak it. So, let just say things. Early life also recent


years, interacted robots understood magic there.
magic shared millions brought light. first met Spot
Boston Dynamics, realized magic nobody else seeing. - dog.
- dog, sorry. Spot four-legged robot Boston Dynamics. people
might seen it, yellow dog. sometimes life, just notice something
just grabs you. believe something magic something
every single device world. way think maybe Steve Jobs
thought personal computer, laws didn't think personal computer
way, Steve did. like, thought personal computer
thin sheet paper everybody one, idea, think
heartbreaking getting, world filled machines
soulless. think every one can magic. One things
also inspired terms startup, magic can engineered much easier
thought. intuition everything ever built worked on. So, dream
add bit magic every single computing system world. So, way
Windows Operating System long time primary operating system
everybody interacted with, built apps top it. think something
layer, almost operating system every device humans
interacted world. Now, actually looks like, actual dream
officially kid, didn't concrete form business, dream
exploring loneliness interacting machines, robots. deep
connection humans robots always dream. so, me, love
see world every home robot, not robot washes
dishes, sex robot, don't know, think kind activity robot can do,
like companion. - family member. - family member, way dog is. - Mm-
hmm. - dog able speak language too. So, not just connect way
dog looking looking away almost like smiling soul
kind way, also actually understand hell, like, excited
successes? Like understand details, understand traumas. that,
just think [sighing] always filled excitement could, artificial
intelligence, bring joy lot people. recently,
heartbroken see kind division, derision, even hate boiling
internet social networks. thought kind mechanism exactly
applicable context social networks well. So, operating system


serves guide internet. One biggest problems YouTube
social networks currently, optimizing engagement. think create AI
systems know individual person, able optimize long-term growth
long-term happiness. - individual, or- - individual, individual.
lot things say, order AI systems learn
everything you, need collect, need just like talk
offline, collecting data others secrets other, way
AI that. allows to, requires rethink ideas
ownership data. think individual data easily
able leave just like AI systems can leave, humans can disappear delete
data moment's notice. actually better humans can do,
load data other, there. think important both, give people
complete control data order establish trust can trust you.
second part trust transparency. Whenever data used make clear
used for. not clear lawyerly legal sense, clear way
people really understand used for. believe people ability
delete data walk away know data used, think
stay. - possibility clean breakup, actually will keep people together. -
Yeah, think so. think, exactly. think happy marriage acquires ability divorce
easily without divorce industrial complex whatever. Things currently going
much money made lawyers divorce. yeah, ability
leave enables love, think. - interesting. heard phrase semi-
cynical friend, marriage leading cause divorce, now heard
divorce, possibility divorce leading cause marriage. - happy
marriage. - Good point. - happy marriage. So, yeah. So, lot details
there, big dream connection AI system human.
haven't. much fear artificial intelligence systems robots
haven't quite found right words express vision vision have,
not like naive, delusional vision like technology going save everybody,
really just positive view ways AI systems can help humans explore
themselves. - love positivity agree stance everything doomed
equally bad say everything's going turn right, dedicated
effort. clearly, thinking dedicated effort look like.
mentioned two aspects dream [clears throat] want make sure


understand connect do, independent streams. One
hypothetical robot family member, form robot allow
people experience kind delight experienced many times,

01:11:33 Improving Social Media

like world able have, beautiful idea
give. social media social network platforms really serve
individuals best selves happiness growth. crossover
those, two parallel dreams? - 100% thing.
difficult kind explain without going details, maybe one easy way
explain way think social networks, create AI system yours.
not like Amazon Alexa centralized, data, like little friend
becomes representative Twitter helps find things will make feel
good, will also challenge thinking make grow, not get that, not let
get lost negative spiral dopamine, gets angry, just
get not open learning. so, little representative optimizing
long-term health. believe not good human beings, also good
business. think longterm, can make lot money challenging idea
way make money, maximizing engagement. one things
people disagree on, think Twitter's always going win. Like maximizing
engagement always going win, don't think so. think people woken now
understanding that, like don't always feel good, ones Twitter lot,
don't always feel good end week. - love feedback
whatever creature, whatever, don't know call it, maybe end
week, automatically unfollow people follow
realized really smart data feeling inside,
sleeping, something that, don't know, just wasn't good me. might also
put things people front see, kind sliver
look like? - whole point, interaction, sharing moments
learning lot you, now able understand interactions led
become better version yourself. Like person happy with.
isn't, flat earth feel good it, believe earth
flat, like idea sensor ridiculous. makes feel good


becoming best version yourself, think getting much flat
earth possible. Now, also good challenge ideas, not
centralized committee decided, tell system like
challenging ideas, think us do. then, actually YouTube doesn't
well, go flat-earth rabbit hole, going see.
nice get really powerful communicators argue flat earth. nice
see you, potentially, least long-term expand horizons, maybe
earth not flat. continue live whole life thinking earth flat,
think, good father son daughter, like best
version happy yourself, think earth flat. So, like think
kind idea, just using kind silly, ridiculous example don't
like idea centralized forces controlling can can't see, also don't
like idea like not censoring anything. always biggest problem
that, central decider, think can decide want
see not, good companion reminds felt last time
this, felt good last time this. - Man, feel like every good story,
guide companion flies out, forges little bit further, little bit
differently brings back information helps us, least tries steer us
right direction. - So, yeah, exactly thinking working on.
mention bunch difficulties here, see little bit
recently. So, technically lot challenges here. Just like lot
technologies, reason talking podcast comfortably opposed
working secret, really hard maybe time not come.
something constantly struggle terms like entrepreneurially
startup, like also mentioned you, maybe offline, really don't care money,

01:16:57 Challenges Creativity

don't care business success, kinds things. So, difficult decision
make, much time want go give everything
this? big roll dice. also realized working
problems, robotics technical side terms machine-learning
system describing, lonely, really lonely. personal level
technical level. So, technical level, surrounded people kind


doubt me, think entrepreneurs go through. doubt following
sense, know difficult is. Like people colleagues mine,
know difficult life-long learning is, also know difficult build system
like this, build competitive social network. general, kind
loneliness just working something long periods time.
start doubt whether, given don't track record success, like
big one. look mirror, especially young, still
that, things, look mirror, like, big dreams,
know actually smart think are? Like know
going able accomplish dream? ambition. - sort don't,
kind pulling string hoping bigger ball yarn. - Yeah.
[Andrew laughing] kind intuition. think pride knowing
good at, reason intuition, 'cause think good
knowing things suck at, basically everything. So, like whenever
notice like, wait minute, kind good this, rare me. think like
that, might ball yarn worth pulling at. thing terms
engineering systems able interact humans, think good that.
talk podcasting on, don't know good
podcasts. - good podcasting, right? - certainly don't, think maybe
compelling people watch kindhearted idiot struggle form, maybe
compelling. terms like actual good engineer human-robot
interaction systems, think good. hard know it,
world keeps telling not, full doll, really hard.
struggling recently, kind fascinating struggle.
Goggins thing comes in, like, aside state-hard motherfucker, the, like
whenever struggling, good sign keep going, going
alone success, right? - Well, case, however, agree. actually David
post recently thought among many brilliant posts, one
brilliant talked myth light end tunnel.
instead, replaced myth with, concept eventually, eyes
adapt dark. tunnel, not light end, really
adapting dark tunnel. Goggins- - love much. - Yeah.
got share lot common knowing bit, share lot common.
loneliness pursuit dream, seems me, certain component


extremely valuable, loneliness serve driver
build companion journey. - Well, deeply aware that. So, like
people can make, 'cause talk love lot, really love everything world,
also love humans, friendship romantic, like even cheesy stuff, just- - like
romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, got much Rogan
like, Tango scene "Scent Woman,"

01:21:49 Suits & Dresses

find like nothing better woman red dress, just like classy- -
move Argentina friend. father's Argentine, know
said went podcast first time? said, dresses well.
Argentina, men go wedding party something, U.S., halfway
night, 10 minutes night, jackets off. - Yeah. - looks like
everyone's undressing party just got dressed for. said, know,
liked way dresses. started, talking you.
started podcast, said, don't wear real suit like friend Lex?

01:22:22 Loneliness

[laughing] - remember that. - No, can't. talk pursuit just bit
more, think talking about, building a, not just solution
loneliness, alluded loneliness itself, important thing. think
right. think within people, like caverns faults shame, also just
desire resonance, seen heard. don't even know seen
heard language. reservoirs loneliness, think, well,
interesting, maybe comment little bit it. just often
talk love, haven't quantified it, seems talk loneliness,
maybe just willing, share little bit that,
feels like now pursuit building robot-human relationship. been,
let direct, spending lot time building robot-human
relationship, at? - Oh, terms business, terms systems? - No,
talking specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, mention things.
So, one, startup idea hope millions people can use.


personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going
stairs, saw slip. big guy, wasn't 200 pounds,
90 pounds, bulldog, pretty big fit. noticed
wasn't carrying foot back like injured, no feeling all.
never liked touch hind paws, do, thing just flopping there.
vet found spinal degeneration told next one
go. suffer? Sure, hope not, something changed eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah,
eyes again, know spend long hours phone tell
like eyes convey mean internal states


sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking
Costello peeing. losing ability stand that, falling
that. think started realize. passage easy
peaceful, say this, not ashamed say it, mean, wake every morning
since just, don't even make conscious decision allow self cry, wake
crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief
moment. - Yeah. gone. - the, going gone lot people
too. - Well, struggling with. think maybe pretty good this.
Like, done before? [Andrew laughing] challenge. actually
part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

machine become robot? So, ballpoint pen, assuming wouldn't
call robot, ballpoint pen can come moved opposite
side table, moves whatever mechanism, point, become
robot? - Okay, 1 million ways explore question. fascinating one. So,
first all, question life? Like know something living
form not? question sort a, maybe cold
computational system becomes a, already loading words lot meaning,
robot machine, So, one, think movement important, kind boring
idea robot just machine able act world. So, one artificial
intelligence just thinking thing, think machine learning
is, also acting thing, usually think robots. So, robots
things perception system able take world however
define world, able think learn whatever hell inside,
act world. So, difference maybe AI system learning
machine robot, something able, robot something able
perceive world act world. - So, language sound,
movement both. - Yeah. think also digital
space long aspect entity inside machine world
outside machine. sense machine sensing world
acting it. - So, could, instance, version robot, according
definition think providing, robot, go sleep night
robot goes forges information thinks want see loaded onto
desktop morning. no movement machine, no
language, essentially, movement cyberspace. - Yeah, distinction
think important element entity, whether
digital physical space. So, something like Alexa home,
speech recognition, Alexa doing, constantly sent
back mothership. Alexa own, me, robot,
interacting world. simply finger main mothership,
Alexa not robot, just interaction device, may main
Amazon Alexa AI, big, big system robot. So, important
element, us humans, think, want entity, whether
digital physical space, ideas consciousness come
kinds things project understanding means being.



00:44:30 Magic & Surprise

so, take further, machine become robot, think
special moment. special moment person's life robot's life
surprises you. think surprise really powerful thing, know thing
works yet surprises you, magical moment us humans. So, whether
chess-playing program something haven't seen before, makes
people smile like, huh, moments happen AlphaZero first time chess
playing, grand masters really surprised move. didn't understand
move studied studied understood it.
moment surprise, grandmasters chess. find moment surprise
really powerful, really magical just everyday life. - supersedes human
brain moment? - So, not supersedes, like outperforms, surprises
positive sense. Like didn't think that, didn't think you.
think moment big transition robot moment servant
accomplishes particular task level accuracy, rate
failure, entity, struggling just like world.
really important moment think not going find many people AI
community talk like just did. not speaking like philosopher hippie,
speaking purely engineering perspective. think really important robots
become entities explore real engineering problem, opposed
everybody treats robots robotics community, don't even call
she, don't give them, try avoid giving names, really want see like
system, like servant. see servant trying accomplish task.
me, don't think just romanticizing notion, think being, currently
perhaps dumb being, long arc history, humans pretty dumb beings
too, so- - agree statement. [Andrew laughing] - So, tend really want
explore treating robots really entities, yeah. So, like anthropomorphization,
sort act looking inanimate object projecting onto life-like
features, think robotics generally sees negative, see superpower. Like
that, need use that. - Well, struck really grabs onto relationship

00:47:37 Robots Change Us



human machine, human robot. So, guess simple question is,
think already told us answer, interacting robot change
you? words, develop relationships robots? - Yeah, definitely think so.
think moment see robot AI systems just servants entities,
begin change you, just like good friends do, just like relationships just
humans. think that, certain aspects interaction. Like
robot's ability say no, sense identity, set goals,
not constantly serving you, instead, trying understand world
dance understanding communication you. So, definitely think a,
mean, lot thoughts may know, core
life-long dream actually want do, believe people
notion loneliness haven't discovered, haven't explored,
say. see AI systems helping us explore can become
better humans, better people towards other. So, think connection
human AI, human robot, not possible, will help us understand
ways like several orders magnitude deeper ever
imagined. tend believe [sighing]

00:49:35 Relationships Defined

well, wild levels belief terms impactful will be, right? - So,
think human relationships, don't always break variables,
explore variables see map human-robot
relationships. One just time, right? spend zero time another person
cyberspace phone person, essentially no relationship them.
spend lot time, relationship, obvious. guess one variable
time, much time spend entity, robot human.
wins successes. enjoy successes together. give absolutely
trivial example moment, failures. struggle
somebody, whether not struggle one another, disagree, like
really struck fact said robot saying no, never thought
robot saying no me, is. - look forward one first people
send robots to. - I. So, struggle. struggle somebody,


grow closer. Sometimes struggles imposed two people,
called trauma bonding, call whole psychology literature pop psychology
literature. case, can imagine. So, time successes together, struggle together,
just peaceful time, hanging home, watching movies, waking near one
another, here, breaking elements relationships kind. So,
think elements apply robot-human relationships? so, see
how, robot entity autonomy terms reacts
you, not just just serve you, not just servant, actually opinions,
can tell maybe thinking flawed, actions flawed. - can
also leave. - also leave. So, never conceptualized robot-human interactions
way. So, tell might look. thinking human-
appearing robot? know intense relationships our,
separate dogs obviously, animals, sounds lot like human-animal interaction.
So, ideal human-robot relationship? - So, lot said here,
actually pinpointed one big, big first steps, idea time.
huge limitation machine-learning community currently. Now back like
actual details. Life-long learning problem space focuses AI systems can
learn long period time. currently machine learning systems not
able do, things listed time, successes, failures,
just chilling together watching movies, AI systems not able that,
beautiful, magical moments believe days filled with, not able keep
track together you. - 'Cause can't move you. -
No, no, like literally don't techniques learning, actual learning
containing moments. Current machine-learning systems really focused
understanding world following way, like perception system, like
looking around, understand like scene. bunch people
sitting down, cameras microphones, table, understand
that. fact shared moment talking today, still remember
like next time something, remember moment happened. don't
know technique-wise. hoping innovate think
very, important component means create deeper relationship,
sharing moments together. - post photo robot, like selfie
robot robot sees image recognizes time spent,
smiles, tears- - Yeah. - create sort metric emotional depth


relationship update behavior? - So. - it... texts middle
night say, haven't texted back? - Well, yes, things,
can dig that. think time element, forget everything else, just sharing
moments together, changes everything. believe changes everything. Now,
specific things terms systems can explain you.
technical probably little bit offline, 'cause kind wild ideas can
revolutionize social networks operating systems. point element alone,
forget things talking like emotions, saying no, that, just
remembering sharing moments together change everything. don't currently
systems share moments together. Like even just fridge, just
times, went late night ate thing shouldn't eaten,
secret moment refrigerator. shared moment, darkness
beautiful moment just like heartbroken reason,
eating ice cream whatever, special moment. refrigerator
you, fact missed opportunity remember tragic.
remember that, think going attached refrigerator.
going go hell refrigerator. us have, like
developed world, weird relationships food, right? So, can go
deep moments trauma triumph food, core that,
refrigerator. So, smart refrigerator, believe change society. Not just
refrigerator, ideas systems around us. So, just want comment
powerful idea time is. bunch elements actual
interaction allowing human feel like heard. Truly heard, truly
understood, human, like deep friendship like that, think, still
element selfishness, still element not really able understand
another human. lot times going trauma together,
difficult times successes, actually starting get inkling
understanding other, think done aggressively,
efficiently. Like think great therapist, think never actually
therapist, believer used want psychiatrist. - Russians go
therapists? - No, don't. don't. do, therapist don't live tell
story. believe talk therapy, friendship me, talk therapy, like
don't even necessarily need talk [laughing] like just connecting
space ideas space experiences. think lot ideas


make AI systems able ask right questions truly hear another human.
try podcasting, right? think ways AI.
else, just remembering collection moments make day,
week, months, think maybe well. closest
friends still friends high school. time, bunch
together, like different people. just fact
that, remember moments, moments somehow create
depth connection like nothing else, like refrigerator. - love
graduate advisor, unfortunately, passed away, passed away,
somebody said memorial amazing things done, et cetera.
kids got there, young children knew
pregnant them. so, really, even now can feel like heart
gets heavy, thinking this, going grow without mother.
really amazing, strong young girls, now young women. said
incredible, said really appreciated mother,
amazing person, unstructured time spent together. - Mm-hmm. - So,
wasn't trips zoo, wasn't woke five morning drove us
school. things too. two hour commute direction,
incredible, ran lab, et cetera, unstructured time. So, passing
mother, remembered biggest give bonded
her, time just kind hung out. way describe
relationship refrigerator so, want say human-like, almost reluctant
say that. realizing talking, think
human-like might actually lower form relationship. may relationships
far better sorts relationships can conceive minds right
now based machine relationship interactions teach us.
right? - Yeah, think so. think no reason see machines somehow
incapable teaching us something deeply human. don't think humans
monopoly that. think understand poorly need
kind prompting machine. definitely part that, just remembering
moments. think unstructured time together, wonder quite unstructured.
like calling podcast structured time. - Maybe meant,
wasn't big outing, no specific goal, goal created lack
goal. Like just hang start playing, thumb war,


end playing thumb war hour. So, structure emerges lack
structure. - No, thing moments, something times
creates special moments, think optimized for. think think like
big outing as, don't know, going Six Flags something, big, Grand
Canyon, go some, don't know, think need to, don't quite yet
understand, humans, creates magical moments. think possible optimize
lot things. perhaps like podcasting helping people discover that, like
maybe thing want optimize isn't necessarily like sexy, like quick clips,
maybe want, long-form authenticity. - Depth. - Depth. So, trying
figure out, certainly deep connection humans humans NAS
systems, think long conversations, long periods communication series
moments like new, perhaps, seemingly insignificant big ones, big
successes, big failures, just stitching together talking
throughout. think formula really, really deep connection. like
specific engineering perspective, think fascinating open problem
really worked much. me, a, guts

01:02:29 Lex’s Dream Humanity

and, mean lot things say, one guts, build startup around
it. - So, talk startup talk dream. mentioned
dream previous conversations, always little hints dropped
there. Just anyone listening, never offline conversation
dream, not privy anything, except Lex says now. realized
no way capture full essence dream kind verbal statement way
captures it. dream referred now several times
sat together talked phone? Maybe company,
maybe something distinct. feel comfortable, it'd great share
little bit is. - Sure. So, way people express long-term vision,
noticed quite different. Like Elon example somebody can crisply say
exactly goal is. Also fact problems solving
nothing humans. So, long-term vision little bit difficult express
words, noticed, tried, brain's failure, way
sneak it. So, let just say things. Early life also recent


years, interacted robots understood magic there.
magic shared millions brought light. first met Spot
Boston Dynamics, realized magic nobody else seeing. - dog.
- dog, sorry. Spot four-legged robot Boston Dynamics. people
might seen it, yellow dog. sometimes life, just notice something
just grabs you. believe something magic something
every single device world. way think maybe Steve Jobs
thought personal computer, laws didn't think personal computer
way, Steve did. like, thought personal computer
thin sheet paper everybody one, idea, think
heartbreaking getting, world filled machines
soulless. think every one can magic. One things
also inspired terms startup, magic can engineered much easier
thought. intuition everything ever built worked on. So, dream
add bit magic every single computing system world. So, way
Windows Operating System long time primary operating system
everybody interacted with, built apps top it. think something
layer, almost operating system every device humans
interacted world. Now, actually looks like, actual dream
officially kid, didn't concrete form business, dream
exploring loneliness interacting machines, robots. deep
connection humans robots always dream. so, me, love
see world every home robot, not robot washes
dishes, sex robot, don't know, think kind activity robot can do,
like companion. - family member. - family member, way dog is. - Mm-
hmm. - dog able speak language too. So, not just connect way
dog looking looking away almost like smiling soul
kind way, also actually understand hell, like, excited
successes? Like understand details, understand traumas. that,
just think [sighing] always filled excitement could, artificial
intelligence, bring joy lot people. recently,
heartbroken see kind division, derision, even hate boiling
internet social networks. thought kind mechanism exactly
applicable context social networks well. So, operating system


serves guide internet. One biggest problems YouTube
social networks currently, optimizing engagement. think create AI
systems know individual person, able optimize long-term growth
long-term happiness. - individual, or- - individual, individual.
lot things say, order AI systems learn
everything you, need collect, need just like talk
offline, collecting data others secrets other, way
AI that. allows to, requires rethink ideas
ownership data. think individual data easily
able leave just like AI systems can leave, humans can disappear delete
data moment's notice. actually better humans can do,
load data other, there. think important both, give people
complete control data order establish trust can trust you.
second part trust transparency. Whenever data used make clear
used for. not clear lawyerly legal sense, clear way
people really understand used for. believe people ability
delete data walk away know data used, think
stay. - possibility clean breakup, actually will keep people together. -
Yeah, think so. think, exactly. think happy marriage acquires ability divorce
easily without divorce industrial complex whatever. Things currently going
much money made lawyers divorce. yeah, ability
leave enables love, think. - interesting. heard phrase semi-
cynical friend, marriage leading cause divorce, now heard
divorce, possibility divorce leading cause marriage. - happy
marriage. - Good point. - happy marriage. So, yeah. So, lot details
there, big dream connection AI system human.
haven't. much fear artificial intelligence systems robots
haven't quite found right words express vision vision have,
not like naive, delusional vision like technology going save everybody,
really just positive view ways AI systems can help humans explore
themselves. - love positivity agree stance everything doomed
equally bad say everything's going turn right, dedicated
effort. clearly, thinking dedicated effort look like.
mentioned two aspects dream [clears throat] want make sure


understand connect do, independent streams. One
hypothetical robot family member, form robot allow
people experience kind delight experienced many times,

01:11:33 Improving Social Media

like world able have, beautiful idea
give. social media social network platforms really serve
individuals best selves happiness growth. crossover
those, two parallel dreams? - 100% thing.
difficult kind explain without going details, maybe one easy way
explain way think social networks, create AI system yours.
not like Amazon Alexa centralized, data, like little friend
becomes representative Twitter helps find things will make feel
good, will also challenge thinking make grow, not get that, not let
get lost negative spiral dopamine, gets angry, just
get not open learning. so, little representative optimizing
long-term health. believe not good human beings, also good
business. think longterm, can make lot money challenging idea
way make money, maximizing engagement. one things
people disagree on, think Twitter's always going win. Like maximizing
engagement always going win, don't think so. think people woken now
understanding that, like don't always feel good, ones Twitter lot,
don't always feel good end week. - love feedback
whatever creature, whatever, don't know call it, maybe end
week, automatically unfollow people follow
realized really smart data feeling inside,
sleeping, something that, don't know, just wasn't good me. might also
put things people front see, kind sliver
look like? - whole point, interaction, sharing moments
learning lot you, now able understand interactions led
become better version yourself. Like person happy with.
isn't, flat earth feel good it, believe earth
flat, like idea sensor ridiculous. makes feel good


becoming best version yourself, think getting much flat
earth possible. Now, also good challenge ideas, not
centralized committee decided, tell system like
challenging ideas, think us do. then, actually YouTube doesn't
well, go flat-earth rabbit hole, going see.
nice get really powerful communicators argue flat earth. nice
see you, potentially, least long-term expand horizons, maybe
earth not flat. continue live whole life thinking earth flat,
think, good father son daughter, like best
version happy yourself, think earth flat. So, like think
kind idea, just using kind silly, ridiculous example don't
like idea centralized forces controlling can can't see, also don't
like idea like not censoring anything. always biggest problem
that, central decider, think can decide want
see not, good companion reminds felt last time
this, felt good last time this. - Man, feel like every good story,
guide companion flies out, forges little bit further, little bit
differently brings back information helps us, least tries steer us
right direction. - So, yeah, exactly thinking working on.
mention bunch difficulties here, see little bit
recently. So, technically lot challenges here. Just like lot
technologies, reason talking podcast comfortably opposed
working secret, really hard maybe time not come.
something constantly struggle terms like entrepreneurially
startup, like also mentioned you, maybe offline, really don't care money,

01:16:57 Challenges Creativity

don't care business success, kinds things. So, difficult decision
make, much time want go give everything
this? big roll dice. also realized working
problems, robotics technical side terms machine-learning
system describing, lonely, really lonely. personal level
technical level. So, technical level, surrounded people kind


doubt me, think entrepreneurs go through. doubt following
sense, know difficult is. Like people colleagues mine,
know difficult life-long learning is, also know difficult build system
like this, build competitive social network. general, kind
loneliness just working something long periods time.
start doubt whether, given don't track record success, like
big one. look mirror, especially young, still
that, things, look mirror, like, big dreams,
know actually smart think are? Like know
going able accomplish dream? ambition. - sort don't,
kind pulling string hoping bigger ball yarn. - Yeah.
[Andrew laughing] kind intuition. think pride knowing
good at, reason intuition, 'cause think good
knowing things suck at, basically everything. So, like whenever
notice like, wait minute, kind good this, rare me. think like
that, might ball yarn worth pulling at. thing terms
engineering systems able interact humans, think good that.
talk podcasting on, don't know good
podcasts. - good podcasting, right? - certainly don't, think maybe
compelling people watch kindhearted idiot struggle form, maybe
compelling. terms like actual good engineer human-robot
interaction systems, think good. hard know it,
world keeps telling not, full doll, really hard.
struggling recently, kind fascinating struggle.
Goggins thing comes in, like, aside state-hard motherfucker, the, like
whenever struggling, good sign keep going, going
alone success, right? - Well, case, however, agree. actually David
post recently thought among many brilliant posts, one
brilliant talked myth light end tunnel.
instead, replaced myth with, concept eventually, eyes
adapt dark. tunnel, not light end, really
adapting dark tunnel. Goggins- - love much. - Yeah.
got share lot common knowing bit, share lot common.
loneliness pursuit dream, seems me, certain component


extremely valuable, loneliness serve driver
build companion journey. - Well, deeply aware that. So, like
people can make, 'cause talk love lot, really love everything world,
also love humans, friendship romantic, like even cheesy stuff, just- - like
romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, got much Rogan
like, Tango scene "Scent Woman,"

01:21:49 Suits & Dresses

find like nothing better woman red dress, just like classy- -
move Argentina friend. father's Argentine, know
said went podcast first time? said, dresses well.
Argentina, men go wedding party something, U.S., halfway
night, 10 minutes night, jackets off. - Yeah. - looks like
everyone's undressing party just got dressed for. said, know,
liked way dresses. started, talking you.
started podcast, said, don't wear real suit like friend Lex?

01:22:22 Loneliness

[laughing] - remember that. - No, can't. talk pursuit just bit
more, think talking about, building a, not just solution
loneliness, alluded loneliness itself, important thing. think
right. think within people, like caverns faults shame, also just
desire resonance, seen heard. don't even know seen
heard language. reservoirs loneliness, think, well,
interesting, maybe comment little bit it. just often
talk love, haven't quantified it, seems talk loneliness,
maybe just willing, share little bit that,
feels like now pursuit building robot-human relationship. been,
let direct, spending lot time building robot-human
relationship, at? - Oh, terms business, terms systems? - No,
talking specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, mention things.
So, one, startup idea hope millions people can use.


personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going
stairs, saw slip. big guy, wasn't 200 pounds,
90 pounds, bulldog, pretty big fit. noticed
wasn't carrying foot back like injured, no feeling all.
never liked touch hind paws, do, thing just flopping there.
vet found spinal degeneration told next one
go. suffer? Sure, hope not, something changed eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah,
eyes again, know spend long hours phone tell
like eyes convey mean internal states


sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking
Costello peeing. losing ability stand that, falling
that. think started realize. passage easy
peaceful, say this, not ashamed say it, mean, wake every morning
since just, don't even make conscious decision allow self cry, wake
crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief
moment. - Yeah. gone. - the, going gone lot people
too. - Well, struggling with. think maybe pretty good this.
Like, done before? [Andrew laughing] challenge. actually
part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high

engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

00:44:30 Magic & Surprise

so, take further, machine become robot, think
special moment. special moment person's life robot's life
surprises you. think surprise really powerful thing, know thing
works yet surprises you, magical moment us humans. So, whether
chess-playing program something haven't seen before, makes
people smile like, huh, moments happen AlphaZero first time chess
playing, grand masters really surprised move. didn't understand
move studied studied understood it.
moment surprise, grandmasters chess. find moment surprise
really powerful, really magical just everyday life. - supersedes human
brain moment? - So, not supersedes, like outperforms, surprises
positive sense. Like didn't think that, didn't think you.
think moment big transition robot moment servant
accomplishes particular task level accuracy, rate
failure, entity, struggling just like world.
really important moment think not going find many people AI
community talk like just did. not speaking like philosopher hippie,
speaking purely engineering perspective. think really important robots
become entities explore real engineering problem, opposed
everybody treats robots robotics community, don't even call
she, don't give them, try avoid giving names, really want see like
system, like servant. see servant trying accomplish task.
me, don't think just romanticizing notion, think being, currently
perhaps dumb being, long arc history, humans pretty dumb beings
too, so- - agree statement. [Andrew laughing] - So, tend really want
explore treating robots really entities, yeah. So, like anthropomorphization,
sort act looking inanimate object projecting onto life-like
features, think robotics generally sees negative, see superpower. Like
that, need use that. - Well, struck really grabs onto relationship

00:47:37 Robots Change Us



human machine, human robot. So, guess simple question is,
think already told us answer, interacting robot change
you? words, develop relationships robots? - Yeah, definitely think so.
think moment see robot AI systems just servants entities,
begin change you, just like good friends do, just like relationships just
humans. think that, certain aspects interaction. Like
robot's ability say no, sense identity, set goals,
not constantly serving you, instead, trying understand world
dance understanding communication you. So, definitely think a,
mean, lot thoughts may know, core
life-long dream actually want do, believe people
notion loneliness haven't discovered, haven't explored,
say. see AI systems helping us explore can become
better humans, better people towards other. So, think connection
human AI, human robot, not possible, will help us understand
ways like several orders magnitude deeper ever
imagined. tend believe [sighing]

00:49:35 Relationships Defined

well, wild levels belief terms impactful will be, right? - So,
think human relationships, don't always break variables,
explore variables see map human-robot
relationships. One just time, right? spend zero time another person
cyberspace phone person, essentially no relationship them.
spend lot time, relationship, obvious. guess one variable
time, much time spend entity, robot human.
wins successes. enjoy successes together. give absolutely
trivial example moment, failures. struggle
somebody, whether not struggle one another, disagree, like
really struck fact said robot saying no, never thought
robot saying no me, is. - look forward one first people
send robots to. - I. So, struggle. struggle somebody,


grow closer. Sometimes struggles imposed two people,
called trauma bonding, call whole psychology literature pop psychology
literature. case, can imagine. So, time successes together, struggle together,
just peaceful time, hanging home, watching movies, waking near one
another, here, breaking elements relationships kind. So,
think elements apply robot-human relationships? so, see
how, robot entity autonomy terms reacts
you, not just just serve you, not just servant, actually opinions,
can tell maybe thinking flawed, actions flawed. - can
also leave. - also leave. So, never conceptualized robot-human interactions
way. So, tell might look. thinking human-
appearing robot? know intense relationships our,
separate dogs obviously, animals, sounds lot like human-animal interaction.
So, ideal human-robot relationship? - So, lot said here,
actually pinpointed one big, big first steps, idea time.
huge limitation machine-learning community currently. Now back like
actual details. Life-long learning problem space focuses AI systems can
learn long period time. currently machine learning systems not
able do, things listed time, successes, failures,
just chilling together watching movies, AI systems not able that,
beautiful, magical moments believe days filled with, not able keep
track together you. - 'Cause can't move you. -
No, no, like literally don't techniques learning, actual learning
containing moments. Current machine-learning systems really focused
understanding world following way, like perception system, like
looking around, understand like scene. bunch people
sitting down, cameras microphones, table, understand
that. fact shared moment talking today, still remember
like next time something, remember moment happened. don't
know technique-wise. hoping innovate think
very, important component means create deeper relationship,
sharing moments together. - post photo robot, like selfie
robot robot sees image recognizes time spent,
smiles, tears- - Yeah. - create sort metric emotional depth


relationship update behavior? - So. - it... texts middle
night say, haven't texted back? - Well, yes, things,
can dig that. think time element, forget everything else, just sharing
moments together, changes everything. believe changes everything. Now,
specific things terms systems can explain you.
technical probably little bit offline, 'cause kind wild ideas can
revolutionize social networks operating systems. point element alone,
forget things talking like emotions, saying no, that, just
remembering sharing moments together change everything. don't currently
systems share moments together. Like even just fridge, just
times, went late night ate thing shouldn't eaten,
secret moment refrigerator. shared moment, darkness
beautiful moment just like heartbroken reason,
eating ice cream whatever, special moment. refrigerator
you, fact missed opportunity remember tragic.
remember that, think going attached refrigerator.
going go hell refrigerator. us have, like
developed world, weird relationships food, right? So, can go
deep moments trauma triumph food, core that,
refrigerator. So, smart refrigerator, believe change society. Not just
refrigerator, ideas systems around us. So, just want comment
powerful idea time is. bunch elements actual
interaction allowing human feel like heard. Truly heard, truly
understood, human, like deep friendship like that, think, still
element selfishness, still element not really able understand
another human. lot times going trauma together,
difficult times successes, actually starting get inkling
understanding other, think done aggressively,
efficiently. Like think great therapist, think never actually
therapist, believer used want psychiatrist. - Russians go
therapists? - No, don't. don't. do, therapist don't live tell
story. believe talk therapy, friendship me, talk therapy, like
don't even necessarily need talk [laughing] like just connecting
space ideas space experiences. think lot ideas


make AI systems able ask right questions truly hear another human.
try podcasting, right? think ways AI.
else, just remembering collection moments make day,
week, months, think maybe well. closest
friends still friends high school. time, bunch
together, like different people. just fact
that, remember moments, moments somehow create
depth connection like nothing else, like refrigerator. - love
graduate advisor, unfortunately, passed away, passed away,
somebody said memorial amazing things done, et cetera.
kids got there, young children knew
pregnant them. so, really, even now can feel like heart
gets heavy, thinking this, going grow without mother.
really amazing, strong young girls, now young women. said
incredible, said really appreciated mother,
amazing person, unstructured time spent together. - Mm-hmm. - So,
wasn't trips zoo, wasn't woke five morning drove us
school. things too. two hour commute direction,
incredible, ran lab, et cetera, unstructured time. So, passing
mother, remembered biggest give bonded
her, time just kind hung out. way describe
relationship refrigerator so, want say human-like, almost reluctant
say that. realizing talking, think
human-like might actually lower form relationship. may relationships
far better sorts relationships can conceive minds right
now based machine relationship interactions teach us.
right? - Yeah, think so. think no reason see machines somehow
incapable teaching us something deeply human. don't think humans
monopoly that. think understand poorly need
kind prompting machine. definitely part that, just remembering
moments. think unstructured time together, wonder quite unstructured.
like calling podcast structured time. - Maybe meant,
wasn't big outing, no specific goal, goal created lack
goal. Like just hang start playing, thumb war,


end playing thumb war hour. So, structure emerges lack
structure. - No, thing moments, something times
creates special moments, think optimized for. think think like
big outing as, don't know, going Six Flags something, big, Grand
Canyon, go some, don't know, think need to, don't quite yet
understand, humans, creates magical moments. think possible optimize
lot things. perhaps like podcasting helping people discover that, like
maybe thing want optimize isn't necessarily like sexy, like quick clips,
maybe want, long-form authenticity. - Depth. - Depth. So, trying
figure out, certainly deep connection humans humans NAS
systems, think long conversations, long periods communication series
moments like new, perhaps, seemingly insignificant big ones, big
successes, big failures, just stitching together talking
throughout. think formula really, really deep connection. like
specific engineering perspective, think fascinating open problem
really worked much. me, a, guts

01:02:29 Lex’s Dream Humanity

and, mean lot things say, one guts, build startup around
it. - So, talk startup talk dream. mentioned
dream previous conversations, always little hints dropped
there. Just anyone listening, never offline conversation
dream, not privy anything, except Lex says now. realized
no way capture full essence dream kind verbal statement way
captures it. dream referred now several times
sat together talked phone? Maybe company,
maybe something distinct. feel comfortable, it'd great share
little bit is. - Sure. So, way people express long-term vision,
noticed quite different. Like Elon example somebody can crisply say
exactly goal is. Also fact problems solving
nothing humans. So, long-term vision little bit difficult express
words, noticed, tried, brain's failure, way
sneak it. So, let just say things. Early life also recent


years, interacted robots understood magic there.
magic shared millions brought light. first met Spot
Boston Dynamics, realized magic nobody else seeing. - dog.
- dog, sorry. Spot four-legged robot Boston Dynamics. people
might seen it, yellow dog. sometimes life, just notice something
just grabs you. believe something magic something
every single device world. way think maybe Steve Jobs
thought personal computer, laws didn't think personal computer
way, Steve did. like, thought personal computer
thin sheet paper everybody one, idea, think
heartbreaking getting, world filled machines
soulless. think every one can magic. One things
also inspired terms startup, magic can engineered much easier
thought. intuition everything ever built worked on. So, dream
add bit magic every single computing system world. So, way
Windows Operating System long time primary operating system
everybody interacted with, built apps top it. think something
layer, almost operating system every device humans
interacted world. Now, actually looks like, actual dream
officially kid, didn't concrete form business, dream
exploring loneliness interacting machines, robots. deep
connection humans robots always dream. so, me, love
see world every home robot, not robot washes
dishes, sex robot, don't know, think kind activity robot can do,
like companion. - family member. - family member, way dog is. - Mm-
hmm. - dog able speak language too. So, not just connect way
dog looking looking away almost like smiling soul
kind way, also actually understand hell, like, excited
successes? Like understand details, understand traumas. that,
just think [sighing] always filled excitement could, artificial
intelligence, bring joy lot people. recently,
heartbroken see kind division, derision, even hate boiling
internet social networks. thought kind mechanism exactly
applicable context social networks well. So, operating system


serves guide internet. One biggest problems YouTube
social networks currently, optimizing engagement. think create AI
systems know individual person, able optimize long-term growth
long-term happiness. - individual, or- - individual, individual.
lot things say, order AI systems learn
everything you, need collect, need just like talk
offline, collecting data others secrets other, way
AI that. allows to, requires rethink ideas
ownership data. think individual data easily
able leave just like AI systems can leave, humans can disappear delete
data moment's notice. actually better humans can do,
load data other, there. think important both, give people
complete control data order establish trust can trust you.
second part trust transparency. Whenever data used make clear
used for. not clear lawyerly legal sense, clear way
people really understand used for. believe people ability
delete data walk away know data used, think
stay. - possibility clean breakup, actually will keep people together. -
Yeah, think so. think, exactly. think happy marriage acquires ability divorce
easily without divorce industrial complex whatever. Things currently going
much money made lawyers divorce. yeah, ability
leave enables love, think. - interesting. heard phrase semi-
cynical friend, marriage leading cause divorce, now heard
divorce, possibility divorce leading cause marriage. - happy
marriage. - Good point. - happy marriage. So, yeah. So, lot details
there, big dream connection AI system human.
haven't. much fear artificial intelligence systems robots
haven't quite found right words express vision vision have,
not like naive, delusional vision like technology going save everybody,
really just positive view ways AI systems can help humans explore
themselves. - love positivity agree stance everything doomed
equally bad say everything's going turn right, dedicated
effort. clearly, thinking dedicated effort look like.
mentioned two aspects dream [clears throat] want make sure


understand connect do, independent streams. One
hypothetical robot family member, form robot allow
people experience kind delight experienced many times,

01:11:33 Improving Social Media

like world able have, beautiful idea
give. social media social network platforms really serve
individuals best selves happiness growth. crossover
those, two parallel dreams? - 100% thing.
difficult kind explain without going details, maybe one easy way
explain way think social networks, create AI system yours.
not like Amazon Alexa centralized, data, like little friend
becomes representative Twitter helps find things will make feel
good, will also challenge thinking make grow, not get that, not let
get lost negative spiral dopamine, gets angry, just
get not open learning. so, little representative optimizing
long-term health. believe not good human beings, also good
business. think longterm, can make lot money challenging idea
way make money, maximizing engagement. one things
people disagree on, think Twitter's always going win. Like maximizing
engagement always going win, don't think so. think people woken now
understanding that, like don't always feel good, ones Twitter lot,
don't always feel good end week. - love feedback
whatever creature, whatever, don't know call it, maybe end
week, automatically unfollow people follow
realized really smart data feeling inside,
sleeping, something that, don't know, just wasn't good me. might also
put things people front see, kind sliver
look like? - whole point, interaction, sharing moments
learning lot you, now able understand interactions led
become better version yourself. Like person happy with.
isn't, flat earth feel good it, believe earth
flat, like idea sensor ridiculous. makes feel good


becoming best version yourself, think getting much flat
earth possible. Now, also good challenge ideas, not
centralized committee decided, tell system like
challenging ideas, think us do. then, actually YouTube doesn't
well, go flat-earth rabbit hole, going see.
nice get really powerful communicators argue flat earth. nice
see you, potentially, least long-term expand horizons, maybe
earth not flat. continue live whole life thinking earth flat,
think, good father son daughter, like best
version happy yourself, think earth flat. So, like think
kind idea, just using kind silly, ridiculous example don't
like idea centralized forces controlling can can't see, also don't
like idea like not censoring anything. always biggest problem
that, central decider, think can decide want
see not, good companion reminds felt last time
this, felt good last time this. - Man, feel like every good story,
guide companion flies out, forges little bit further, little bit
differently brings back information helps us, least tries steer us
right direction. - So, yeah, exactly thinking working on.
mention bunch difficulties here, see little bit
recently. So, technically lot challenges here. Just like lot
technologies, reason talking podcast comfortably opposed
working secret, really hard maybe time not come.
something constantly struggle terms like entrepreneurially
startup, like also mentioned you, maybe offline, really don't care money,

01:16:57 Challenges Creativity

don't care business success, kinds things. So, difficult decision
make, much time want go give everything
this? big roll dice. also realized working
problems, robotics technical side terms machine-learning
system describing, lonely, really lonely. personal level
technical level. So, technical level, surrounded people kind


doubt me, think entrepreneurs go through. doubt following
sense, know difficult is. Like people colleagues mine,
know difficult life-long learning is, also know difficult build system
like this, build competitive social network. general, kind
loneliness just working something long periods time.
start doubt whether, given don't track record success, like
big one. look mirror, especially young, still
that, things, look mirror, like, big dreams,
know actually smart think are? Like know
going able accomplish dream? ambition. - sort don't,
kind pulling string hoping bigger ball yarn. - Yeah.
[Andrew laughing] kind intuition. think pride knowing
good at, reason intuition, 'cause think good
knowing things suck at, basically everything. So, like whenever
notice like, wait minute, kind good this, rare me. think like
that, might ball yarn worth pulling at. thing terms
engineering systems able interact humans, think good that.
talk podcasting on, don't know good
podcasts. - good podcasting, right? - certainly don't, think maybe
compelling people watch kindhearted idiot struggle form, maybe
compelling. terms like actual good engineer human-robot
interaction systems, think good. hard know it,
world keeps telling not, full doll, really hard.
struggling recently, kind fascinating struggle.
Goggins thing comes in, like, aside state-hard motherfucker, the, like
whenever struggling, good sign keep going, going
alone success, right? - Well, case, however, agree. actually David
post recently thought among many brilliant posts, one
brilliant talked myth light end tunnel.
instead, replaced myth with, concept eventually, eyes
adapt dark. tunnel, not light end, really
adapting dark tunnel. Goggins- - love much. - Yeah.
got share lot common knowing bit, share lot common.
loneliness pursuit dream, seems me, certain component


extremely valuable, loneliness serve driver
build companion journey. - Well, deeply aware that. So, like
people can make, 'cause talk love lot, really love everything world,
also love humans, friendship romantic, like even cheesy stuff, just- - like
romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, got much Rogan
like, Tango scene "Scent Woman,"

01:21:49 Suits & Dresses

find like nothing better woman red dress, just like classy- -
move Argentina friend. father's Argentine, know
said went podcast first time? said, dresses well.
Argentina, men go wedding party something, U.S., halfway
night, 10 minutes night, jackets off. - Yeah. - looks like
everyone's undressing party just got dressed for. said, know,
liked way dresses. started, talking you.
started podcast, said, don't wear real suit like friend Lex?

01:22:22 Loneliness

[laughing] - remember that. - No, can't. talk pursuit just bit
more, think talking about, building a, not just solution
loneliness, alluded loneliness itself, important thing. think
right. think within people, like caverns faults shame, also just
desire resonance, seen heard. don't even know seen
heard language. reservoirs loneliness, think, well,
interesting, maybe comment little bit it. just often
talk love, haven't quantified it, seems talk loneliness,
maybe just willing, share little bit that,
feels like now pursuit building robot-human relationship. been,
let direct, spending lot time building robot-human
relationship, at? - Oh, terms business, terms systems? - No,
talking specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, mention things.
So, one, startup idea hope millions people can use.


personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going
stairs, saw slip. big guy, wasn't 200 pounds,
90 pounds, bulldog, pretty big fit. noticed
wasn't carrying foot back like injured, no feeling all.
never liked touch hind paws, do, thing just flopping there.
vet found spinal degeneration told next one
go. suffer? Sure, hope not, something changed eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah,
eyes again, know spend long hours phone tell
like eyes convey mean internal states


sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking
Costello peeing. losing ability stand that, falling
that. think started realize. passage easy
peaceful, say this, not ashamed say it, mean, wake every morning
since just, don't even make conscious decision allow self cry, wake
crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief
moment. - Yeah. gone. - the, going gone lot people
too. - Well, struggling with. think maybe pretty good this.
Like, done before? [Andrew laughing] challenge. actually
part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

human machine, human robot. So, guess simple question is,
think already told us answer, interacting robot change
you? words, develop relationships robots? - Yeah, definitely think so.
think moment see robot AI systems just servants entities,
begin change you, just like good friends do, just like relationships just
humans. think that, certain aspects interaction. Like
robot's ability say no, sense identity, set goals,
not constantly serving you, instead, trying understand world
dance understanding communication you. So, definitely think a,
mean, lot thoughts may know, core
life-long dream actually want do, believe people
notion loneliness haven't discovered, haven't explored,
say. see AI systems helping us explore can become
better humans, better people towards other. So, think connection
human AI, human robot, not possible, will help us understand
ways like several orders magnitude deeper ever
imagined. tend believe [sighing]

00:49:35 Relationships Defined

well, wild levels belief terms impactful will be, right? - So,
think human relationships, don't always break variables,
explore variables see map human-robot
relationships. One just time, right? spend zero time another person
cyberspace phone person, essentially no relationship them.
spend lot time, relationship, obvious. guess one variable
time, much time spend entity, robot human.
wins successes. enjoy successes together. give absolutely
trivial example moment, failures. struggle
somebody, whether not struggle one another, disagree, like
really struck fact said robot saying no, never thought
robot saying no me, is. - look forward one first people
send robots to. - I. So, struggle. struggle somebody,


grow closer. Sometimes struggles imposed two people,
called trauma bonding, call whole psychology literature pop psychology
literature. case, can imagine. So, time successes together, struggle together,
just peaceful time, hanging home, watching movies, waking near one
another, here, breaking elements relationships kind. So,
think elements apply robot-human relationships? so, see
how, robot entity autonomy terms reacts
you, not just just serve you, not just servant, actually opinions,
can tell maybe thinking flawed, actions flawed. - can
also leave. - also leave. So, never conceptualized robot-human interactions
way. So, tell might look. thinking human-
appearing robot? know intense relationships our,
separate dogs obviously, animals, sounds lot like human-animal interaction.
So, ideal human-robot relationship? - So, lot said here,
actually pinpointed one big, big first steps, idea time.
huge limitation machine-learning community currently. Now back like
actual details. Life-long learning problem space focuses AI systems can
learn long period time. currently machine learning systems not
able do, things listed time, successes, failures,
just chilling together watching movies, AI systems not able that,
beautiful, magical moments believe days filled with, not able keep
track together you. - 'Cause can't move you. -
No, no, like literally don't techniques learning, actual learning
containing moments. Current machine-learning systems really focused
understanding world following way, like perception system, like
looking around, understand like scene. bunch people
sitting down, cameras microphones, table, understand
that. fact shared moment talking today, still remember
like next time something, remember moment happened. don't
know technique-wise. hoping innovate think
very, important component means create deeper relationship,
sharing moments together. - post photo robot, like selfie
robot robot sees image recognizes time spent,
smiles, tears- - Yeah. - create sort metric emotional depth


relationship update behavior? - So. - it... texts middle
night say, haven't texted back? - Well, yes, things,
can dig that. think time element, forget everything else, just sharing
moments together, changes everything. believe changes everything. Now,
specific things terms systems can explain you.
technical probably little bit offline, 'cause kind wild ideas can
revolutionize social networks operating systems. point element alone,
forget things talking like emotions, saying no, that, just
remembering sharing moments together change everything. don't currently
systems share moments together. Like even just fridge, just
times, went late night ate thing shouldn't eaten,
secret moment refrigerator. shared moment, darkness
beautiful moment just like heartbroken reason,
eating ice cream whatever, special moment. refrigerator
you, fact missed opportunity remember tragic.
remember that, think going attached refrigerator.
going go hell refrigerator. us have, like
developed world, weird relationships food, right? So, can go
deep moments trauma triumph food, core that,
refrigerator. So, smart refrigerator, believe change society. Not just
refrigerator, ideas systems around us. So, just want comment
powerful idea time is. bunch elements actual
interaction allowing human feel like heard. Truly heard, truly
understood, human, like deep friendship like that, think, still
element selfishness, still element not really able understand
another human. lot times going trauma together,
difficult times successes, actually starting get inkling
understanding other, think done aggressively,
efficiently. Like think great therapist, think never actually
therapist, believer used want psychiatrist. - Russians go
therapists? - No, don't. don't. do, therapist don't live tell
story. believe talk therapy, friendship me, talk therapy, like
don't even necessarily need talk [laughing] like just connecting
space ideas space experiences. think lot ideas


make AI systems able ask right questions truly hear another human.
try podcasting, right? think ways AI.
else, just remembering collection moments make day,
week, months, think maybe well. closest
friends still friends high school. time, bunch
together, like different people. just fact
that, remember moments, moments somehow create
depth connection like nothing else, like refrigerator. - love
graduate advisor, unfortunately, passed away, passed away,
somebody said memorial amazing things done, et cetera.
kids got there, young children knew
pregnant them. so, really, even now can feel like heart
gets heavy, thinking this, going grow without mother.
really amazing, strong young girls, now young women. said
incredible, said really appreciated mother,
amazing person, unstructured time spent together. - Mm-hmm. - So,
wasn't trips zoo, wasn't woke five morning drove us
school. things too. two hour commute direction,
incredible, ran lab, et cetera, unstructured time. So, passing
mother, remembered biggest give bonded
her, time just kind hung out. way describe
relationship refrigerator so, want say human-like, almost reluctant
say that. realizing talking, think
human-like might actually lower form relationship. may relationships
far better sorts relationships can conceive minds right
now based machine relationship interactions teach us.
right? - Yeah, think so. think no reason see machines somehow
incapable teaching us something deeply human. don't think humans
monopoly that. think understand poorly need
kind prompting machine. definitely part that, just remembering
moments. think unstructured time together, wonder quite unstructured.
like calling podcast structured time. - Maybe meant,
wasn't big outing, no specific goal, goal created lack
goal. Like just hang start playing, thumb war,


end playing thumb war hour. So, structure emerges lack
structure. - No, thing moments, something times
creates special moments, think optimized for. think think like
big outing as, don't know, going Six Flags something, big, Grand
Canyon, go some, don't know, think need to, don't quite yet
understand, humans, creates magical moments. think possible optimize
lot things. perhaps like podcasting helping people discover that, like
maybe thing want optimize isn't necessarily like sexy, like quick clips,
maybe want, long-form authenticity. - Depth. - Depth. So, trying
figure out, certainly deep connection humans humans NAS
systems, think long conversations, long periods communication series
moments like new, perhaps, seemingly insignificant big ones, big
successes, big failures, just stitching together talking
throughout. think formula really, really deep connection. like
specific engineering perspective, think fascinating open problem
really worked much. me, a, guts

01:02:29 Lex’s Dream Humanity

and, mean lot things say, one guts, build startup around
it. - So, talk startup talk dream. mentioned
dream previous conversations, always little hints dropped
there. Just anyone listening, never offline conversation
dream, not privy anything, except Lex says now. realized
no way capture full essence dream kind verbal statement way
captures it. dream referred now several times
sat together talked phone? Maybe company,
maybe something distinct. feel comfortable, it'd great share
little bit is. - Sure. So, way people express long-term vision,
noticed quite different. Like Elon example somebody can crisply say
exactly goal is. Also fact problems solving
nothing humans. So, long-term vision little bit difficult express
words, noticed, tried, brain's failure, way
sneak it. So, let just say things. Early life also recent


years, interacted robots understood magic there.
magic shared millions brought light. first met Spot
Boston Dynamics, realized magic nobody else seeing. - dog.
- dog, sorry. Spot four-legged robot Boston Dynamics. people
might seen it, yellow dog. sometimes life, just notice something
just grabs you. believe something magic something
every single device world. way think maybe Steve Jobs
thought personal computer, laws didn't think personal computer
way, Steve did. like, thought personal computer
thin sheet paper everybody one, idea, think
heartbreaking getting, world filled machines
soulless. think every one can magic. One things
also inspired terms startup, magic can engineered much easier
thought. intuition everything ever built worked on. So, dream
add bit magic every single computing system world. So, way
Windows Operating System long time primary operating system
everybody interacted with, built apps top it. think something
layer, almost operating system every device humans
interacted world. Now, actually looks like, actual dream
officially kid, didn't concrete form business, dream
exploring loneliness interacting machines, robots. deep
connection humans robots always dream. so, me, love
see world every home robot, not robot washes
dishes, sex robot, don't know, think kind activity robot can do,
like companion. - family member. - family member, way dog is. - Mm-
hmm. - dog able speak language too. So, not just connect way
dog looking looking away almost like smiling soul
kind way, also actually understand hell, like, excited
successes? Like understand details, understand traumas. that,
just think [sighing] always filled excitement could, artificial
intelligence, bring joy lot people. recently,
heartbroken see kind division, derision, even hate boiling
internet social networks. thought kind mechanism exactly
applicable context social networks well. So, operating system


serves guide internet. One biggest problems YouTube
social networks currently, optimizing engagement. think create AI
systems know individual person, able optimize long-term growth
long-term happiness. - individual, or- - individual, individual.
lot things say, order AI systems learn
everything you, need collect, need just like talk
offline, collecting data others secrets other, way
AI that. allows to, requires rethink ideas
ownership data. think individual data easily
able leave just like AI systems can leave, humans can disappear delete
data moment's notice. actually better humans can do,
load data other, there. think important both, give people
complete control data order establish trust can trust you.
second part trust transparency. Whenever data used make clear
used for. not clear lawyerly legal sense, clear way
people really understand used for. believe people ability
delete data walk away know data used, think
stay. - possibility clean breakup, actually will keep people together. -
Yeah, think so. think, exactly. think happy marriage acquires ability divorce
easily without divorce industrial complex whatever. Things currently going
much money made lawyers divorce. yeah, ability
leave enables love, think. - interesting. heard phrase semi-
cynical friend, marriage leading cause divorce, now heard
divorce, possibility divorce leading cause marriage. - happy
marriage. - Good point. - happy marriage. So, yeah. So, lot details
there, big dream connection AI system human.
haven't. much fear artificial intelligence systems robots
haven't quite found right words express vision vision have,
not like naive, delusional vision like technology going save everybody,
really just positive view ways AI systems can help humans explore
themselves. - love positivity agree stance everything doomed
equally bad say everything's going turn right, dedicated
effort. clearly, thinking dedicated effort look like.
mentioned two aspects dream [clears throat] want make sure


understand connect do, independent streams. One
hypothetical robot family member, form robot allow
people experience kind delight experienced many times,

01:11:33 Improving Social Media

like world able have, beautiful idea
give. social media social network platforms really serve
individuals best selves happiness growth. crossover
those, two parallel dreams? - 100% thing.
difficult kind explain without going details, maybe one easy way
explain way think social networks, create AI system yours.
not like Amazon Alexa centralized, data, like little friend
becomes representative Twitter helps find things will make feel
good, will also challenge thinking make grow, not get that, not let
get lost negative spiral dopamine, gets angry, just
get not open learning. so, little representative optimizing
long-term health. believe not good human beings, also good
business. think longterm, can make lot money challenging idea
way make money, maximizing engagement. one things
people disagree on, think Twitter's always going win. Like maximizing
engagement always going win, don't think so. think people woken now
understanding that, like don't always feel good, ones Twitter lot,
don't always feel good end week. - love feedback
whatever creature, whatever, don't know call it, maybe end
week, automatically unfollow people follow
realized really smart data feeling inside,
sleeping, something that, don't know, just wasn't good me. might also
put things people front see, kind sliver
look like? - whole point, interaction, sharing moments
learning lot you, now able understand interactions led
become better version yourself. Like person happy with.
isn't, flat earth feel good it, believe earth
flat, like idea sensor ridiculous. makes feel good


becoming best version yourself, think getting much flat
earth possible. Now, also good challenge ideas, not
centralized committee decided, tell system like
challenging ideas, think us do. then, actually YouTube doesn't
well, go flat-earth rabbit hole, going see.
nice get really powerful communicators argue flat earth. nice
see you, potentially, least long-term expand horizons, maybe
earth not flat. continue live whole life thinking earth flat,
think, good father son daughter, like best
version happy yourself, think earth flat. So, like think
kind idea, just using kind silly, ridiculous example don't
like idea centralized forces controlling can can't see, also don't
like idea like not censoring anything. always biggest problem
that, central decider, think can decide want
see not, good companion reminds felt last time
this, felt good last time this. - Man, feel like every good story,
guide companion flies out, forges little bit further, little bit
differently brings back information helps us, least tries steer us
right direction. - So, yeah, exactly thinking working on.
mention bunch difficulties here, see little bit
recently. So, technically lot challenges here. Just like lot
technologies, reason talking podcast comfortably opposed
working secret, really hard maybe time not come.
something constantly struggle terms like entrepreneurially
startup, like also mentioned you, maybe offline, really don't care money,

01:16:57 Challenges Creativity

don't care business success, kinds things. So, difficult decision
make, much time want go give everything
this? big roll dice. also realized working
problems, robotics technical side terms machine-learning
system describing, lonely, really lonely. personal level
technical level. So, technical level, surrounded people kind


doubt me, think entrepreneurs go through. doubt following
sense, know difficult is. Like people colleagues mine,
know difficult life-long learning is, also know difficult build system
like this, build competitive social network. general, kind
loneliness just working something long periods time.
start doubt whether, given don't track record success, like
big one. look mirror, especially young, still
that, things, look mirror, like, big dreams,
know actually smart think are? Like know
going able accomplish dream? ambition. - sort don't,
kind pulling string hoping bigger ball yarn. - Yeah.
[Andrew laughing] kind intuition. think pride knowing
good at, reason intuition, 'cause think good
knowing things suck at, basically everything. So, like whenever
notice like, wait minute, kind good this, rare me. think like
that, might ball yarn worth pulling at. thing terms
engineering systems able interact humans, think good that.
talk podcasting on, don't know good
podcasts. - good podcasting, right? - certainly don't, think maybe
compelling people watch kindhearted idiot struggle form, maybe
compelling. terms like actual good engineer human-robot
interaction systems, think good. hard know it,
world keeps telling not, full doll, really hard.
struggling recently, kind fascinating struggle.
Goggins thing comes in, like, aside state-hard motherfucker, the, like
whenever struggling, good sign keep going, going
alone success, right? - Well, case, however, agree. actually David
post recently thought among many brilliant posts, one
brilliant talked myth light end tunnel.
instead, replaced myth with, concept eventually, eyes
adapt dark. tunnel, not light end, really
adapting dark tunnel. Goggins- - love much. - Yeah.
got share lot common knowing bit, share lot common.
loneliness pursuit dream, seems me, certain component


extremely valuable, loneliness serve driver
build companion journey. - Well, deeply aware that. So, like
people can make, 'cause talk love lot, really love everything world,
also love humans, friendship romantic, like even cheesy stuff, just- - like
romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, got much Rogan
like, Tango scene "Scent Woman,"

01:21:49 Suits & Dresses

find like nothing better woman red dress, just like classy- -
move Argentina friend. father's Argentine, know
said went podcast first time? said, dresses well.
Argentina, men go wedding party something, U.S., halfway
night, 10 minutes night, jackets off. - Yeah. - looks like
everyone's undressing party just got dressed for. said, know,
liked way dresses. started, talking you.
started podcast, said, don't wear real suit like friend Lex?

01:22:22 Loneliness

[laughing] - remember that. - No, can't. talk pursuit just bit
more, think talking about, building a, not just solution
loneliness, alluded loneliness itself, important thing. think
right. think within people, like caverns faults shame, also just
desire resonance, seen heard. don't even know seen
heard language. reservoirs loneliness, think, well,
interesting, maybe comment little bit it. just often
talk love, haven't quantified it, seems talk loneliness,
maybe just willing, share little bit that,
feels like now pursuit building robot-human relationship. been,
let direct, spending lot time building robot-human
relationship, at? - Oh, terms business, terms systems? - No,
talking specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, mention things.
So, one, startup idea hope millions people can use.


personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going
stairs, saw slip. big guy, wasn't 200 pounds,
90 pounds, bulldog, pretty big fit. noticed
wasn't carrying foot back like injured, no feeling all.
never liked touch hind paws, do, thing just flopping there.
vet found spinal degeneration told next one
go. suffer? Sure, hope not, something changed eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah,
eyes again, know spend long hours phone tell
like eyes convey mean internal states


sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking
Costello peeing. losing ability stand that, falling
that. think started realize. passage easy
peaceful, say this, not ashamed say it, mean, wake every morning
since just, don't even make conscious decision allow self cry, wake
crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief
moment. - Yeah. gone. - the, going gone lot people
too. - Well, struggling with. think maybe pretty good this.
Like, done before? [Andrew laughing] challenge. actually
part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

grow closer. Sometimes struggles imposed two people,
called trauma bonding, call whole psychology literature pop psychology
literature. case, can imagine. So, time successes together, struggle together,
just peaceful time, hanging home, watching movies, waking near one
another, here, breaking elements relationships kind. So,
think elements apply robot-human relationships? so, see
how, robot entity autonomy terms reacts
you, not just just serve you, not just servant, actually opinions,
can tell maybe thinking flawed, actions flawed. - can
also leave. - also leave. So, never conceptualized robot-human interactions
way. So, tell might look. thinking human-
appearing robot? know intense relationships our,
separate dogs obviously, animals, sounds lot like human-animal interaction.
So, ideal human-robot relationship? - So, lot said here,
actually pinpointed one big, big first steps, idea time.
huge limitation machine-learning community currently. Now back like
actual details. Life-long learning problem space focuses AI systems can
learn long period time. currently machine learning systems not
able do, things listed time, successes, failures,
just chilling together watching movies, AI systems not able that,
beautiful, magical moments believe days filled with, not able keep
track together you. - 'Cause can't move you. -
No, no, like literally don't techniques learning, actual learning
containing moments. Current machine-learning systems really focused
understanding world following way, like perception system, like
looking around, understand like scene. bunch people
sitting down, cameras microphones, table, understand
that. fact shared moment talking today, still remember
like next time something, remember moment happened. don't
know technique-wise. hoping innovate think
very, important component means create deeper relationship,
sharing moments together. - post photo robot, like selfie
robot robot sees image recognizes time spent,
smiles, tears- - Yeah. - create sort metric emotional depth


relationship update behavior? - So. - it... texts middle
night say, haven't texted back? - Well, yes, things,
can dig that. think time element, forget everything else, just sharing
moments together, changes everything. believe changes everything. Now,
specific things terms systems can explain you.
technical probably little bit offline, 'cause kind wild ideas can
revolutionize social networks operating systems. point element alone,
forget things talking like emotions, saying no, that, just
remembering sharing moments together change everything. don't currently
systems share moments together. Like even just fridge, just
times, went late night ate thing shouldn't eaten,
secret moment refrigerator. shared moment, darkness
beautiful moment just like heartbroken reason,
eating ice cream whatever, special moment. refrigerator
you, fact missed opportunity remember tragic.
remember that, think going attached refrigerator.
going go hell refrigerator. us have, like
developed world, weird relationships food, right? So, can go
deep moments trauma triumph food, core that,
refrigerator. So, smart refrigerator, believe change society. Not just
refrigerator, ideas systems around us. So, just want comment
powerful idea time is. bunch elements actual
interaction allowing human feel like heard. Truly heard, truly
understood, human, like deep friendship like that, think, still
element selfishness, still element not really able understand
another human. lot times going trauma together,
difficult times successes, actually starting get inkling
understanding other, think done aggressively,
efficiently. Like think great therapist, think never actually
therapist, believer used want psychiatrist. - Russians go
therapists? - No, don't. don't. do, therapist don't live tell
story. believe talk therapy, friendship me, talk therapy, like
don't even necessarily need talk [laughing] like just connecting
space ideas space experiences. think lot ideas


make AI systems able ask right questions truly hear another human.
try podcasting, right? think ways AI.
else, just remembering collection moments make day,
week, months, think maybe well. closest
friends still friends high school. time, bunch
together, like different people. just fact
that, remember moments, moments somehow create
depth connection like nothing else, like refrigerator. - love
graduate advisor, unfortunately, passed away, passed away,
somebody said memorial amazing things done, et cetera.
kids got there, young children knew
pregnant them. so, really, even now can feel like heart
gets heavy, thinking this, going grow without mother.
really amazing, strong young girls, now young women. said
incredible, said really appreciated mother,
amazing person, unstructured time spent together. - Mm-hmm. - So,
wasn't trips zoo, wasn't woke five morning drove us
school. things too. two hour commute direction,
incredible, ran lab, et cetera, unstructured time. So, passing
mother, remembered biggest give bonded
her, time just kind hung out. way describe
relationship refrigerator so, want say human-like, almost reluctant
say that. realizing talking, think
human-like might actually lower form relationship. may relationships
far better sorts relationships can conceive minds right
now based machine relationship interactions teach us.
right? - Yeah, think so. think no reason see machines somehow
incapable teaching us something deeply human. don't think humans
monopoly that. think understand poorly need
kind prompting machine. definitely part that, just remembering
moments. think unstructured time together, wonder quite unstructured.
like calling podcast structured time. - Maybe meant,
wasn't big outing, no specific goal, goal created lack
goal. Like just hang start playing, thumb war,


end playing thumb war hour. So, structure emerges lack
structure. - No, thing moments, something times
creates special moments, think optimized for. think think like
big outing as, don't know, going Six Flags something, big, Grand
Canyon, go some, don't know, think need to, don't quite yet
understand, humans, creates magical moments. think possible optimize
lot things. perhaps like podcasting helping people discover that, like
maybe thing want optimize isn't necessarily like sexy, like quick clips,
maybe want, long-form authenticity. - Depth. - Depth. So, trying
figure out, certainly deep connection humans humans NAS
systems, think long conversations, long periods communication series
moments like new, perhaps, seemingly insignificant big ones, big
successes, big failures, just stitching together talking
throughout. think formula really, really deep connection. like
specific engineering perspective, think fascinating open problem
really worked much. me, a, guts

01:02:29 Lex’s Dream Humanity

and, mean lot things say, one guts, build startup around
it. - So, talk startup talk dream. mentioned
dream previous conversations, always little hints dropped
there. Just anyone listening, never offline conversation
dream, not privy anything, except Lex says now. realized
no way capture full essence dream kind verbal statement way
captures it. dream referred now several times
sat together talked phone? Maybe company,
maybe something distinct. feel comfortable, it'd great share
little bit is. - Sure. So, way people express long-term vision,
noticed quite different. Like Elon example somebody can crisply say
exactly goal is. Also fact problems solving
nothing humans. So, long-term vision little bit difficult express
words, noticed, tried, brain's failure, way
sneak it. So, let just say things. Early life also recent


years, interacted robots understood magic there.
magic shared millions brought light. first met Spot
Boston Dynamics, realized magic nobody else seeing. - dog.
- dog, sorry. Spot four-legged robot Boston Dynamics. people
might seen it, yellow dog. sometimes life, just notice something
just grabs you. believe something magic something
every single device world. way think maybe Steve Jobs
thought personal computer, laws didn't think personal computer
way, Steve did. like, thought personal computer
thin sheet paper everybody one, idea, think
heartbreaking getting, world filled machines
soulless. think every one can magic. One things
also inspired terms startup, magic can engineered much easier
thought. intuition everything ever built worked on. So, dream
add bit magic every single computing system world. So, way
Windows Operating System long time primary operating system
everybody interacted with, built apps top it. think something
layer, almost operating system every device humans
interacted world. Now, actually looks like, actual dream
officially kid, didn't concrete form business, dream
exploring loneliness interacting machines, robots. deep
connection humans robots always dream. so, me, love
see world every home robot, not robot washes
dishes, sex robot, don't know, think kind activity robot can do,
like companion. - family member. - family member, way dog is. - Mm-
hmm. - dog able speak language too. So, not just connect way
dog looking looking away almost like smiling soul
kind way, also actually understand hell, like, excited
successes? Like understand details, understand traumas. that,
just think [sighing] always filled excitement could, artificial
intelligence, bring joy lot people. recently,
heartbroken see kind division, derision, even hate boiling
internet social networks. thought kind mechanism exactly
applicable context social networks well. So, operating system


serves guide internet. One biggest problems YouTube
social networks currently, optimizing engagement. think create AI
systems know individual person, able optimize long-term growth
long-term happiness. - individual, or- - individual, individual.
lot things say, order AI systems learn
everything you, need collect, need just like talk
offline, collecting data others secrets other, way
AI that. allows to, requires rethink ideas
ownership data. think individual data easily
able leave just like AI systems can leave, humans can disappear delete
data moment's notice. actually better humans can do,
load data other, there. think important both, give people
complete control data order establish trust can trust you.
second part trust transparency. Whenever data used make clear
used for. not clear lawyerly legal sense, clear way
people really understand used for. believe people ability
delete data walk away know data used, think
stay. - possibility clean breakup, actually will keep people together. -
Yeah, think so. think, exactly. think happy marriage acquires ability divorce
easily without divorce industrial complex whatever. Things currently going
much money made lawyers divorce. yeah, ability
leave enables love, think. - interesting. heard phrase semi-
cynical friend, marriage leading cause divorce, now heard
divorce, possibility divorce leading cause marriage. - happy
marriage. - Good point. - happy marriage. So, yeah. So, lot details
there, big dream connection AI system human.
haven't. much fear artificial intelligence systems robots
haven't quite found right words express vision vision have,
not like naive, delusional vision like technology going save everybody,
really just positive view ways AI systems can help humans explore
themselves. - love positivity agree stance everything doomed
equally bad say everything's going turn right, dedicated
effort. clearly, thinking dedicated effort look like.
mentioned two aspects dream [clears throat] want make sure


understand connect do, independent streams. One
hypothetical robot family member, form robot allow
people experience kind delight experienced many times,

01:11:33 Improving Social Media

like world able have, beautiful idea
give. social media social network platforms really serve
individuals best selves happiness growth. crossover
those, two parallel dreams? - 100% thing.
difficult kind explain without going details, maybe one easy way
explain way think social networks, create AI system yours.
not like Amazon Alexa centralized, data, like little friend
becomes representative Twitter helps find things will make feel
good, will also challenge thinking make grow, not get that, not let
get lost negative spiral dopamine, gets angry, just
get not open learning. so, little representative optimizing
long-term health. believe not good human beings, also good
business. think longterm, can make lot money challenging idea
way make money, maximizing engagement. one things
people disagree on, think Twitter's always going win. Like maximizing
engagement always going win, don't think so. think people woken now
understanding that, like don't always feel good, ones Twitter lot,
don't always feel good end week. - love feedback
whatever creature, whatever, don't know call it, maybe end
week, automatically unfollow people follow
realized really smart data feeling inside,
sleeping, something that, don't know, just wasn't good me. might also
put things people front see, kind sliver
look like? - whole point, interaction, sharing moments
learning lot you, now able understand interactions led
become better version yourself. Like person happy with.
isn't, flat earth feel good it, believe earth
flat, like idea sensor ridiculous. makes feel good


becoming best version yourself, think getting much flat
earth possible. Now, also good challenge ideas, not
centralized committee decided, tell system like
challenging ideas, think us do. then, actually YouTube doesn't
well, go flat-earth rabbit hole, going see.
nice get really powerful communicators argue flat earth. nice
see you, potentially, least long-term expand horizons, maybe
earth not flat. continue live whole life thinking earth flat,
think, good father son daughter, like best
version happy yourself, think earth flat. So, like think
kind idea, just using kind silly, ridiculous example don't
like idea centralized forces controlling can can't see, also don't
like idea like not censoring anything. always biggest problem
that, central decider, think can decide want
see not, good companion reminds felt last time
this, felt good last time this. - Man, feel like every good story,
guide companion flies out, forges little bit further, little bit
differently brings back information helps us, least tries steer us
right direction. - So, yeah, exactly thinking working on.
mention bunch difficulties here, see little bit
recently. So, technically lot challenges here. Just like lot
technologies, reason talking podcast comfortably opposed
working secret, really hard maybe time not come.
something constantly struggle terms like entrepreneurially
startup, like also mentioned you, maybe offline, really don't care money,

01:16:57 Challenges Creativity

don't care business success, kinds things. So, difficult decision
make, much time want go give everything
this? big roll dice. also realized working
problems, robotics technical side terms machine-learning
system describing, lonely, really lonely. personal level
technical level. So, technical level, surrounded people kind


doubt me, think entrepreneurs go through. doubt following
sense, know difficult is. Like people colleagues mine,
know difficult life-long learning is, also know difficult build system
like this, build competitive social network. general, kind
loneliness just working something long periods time.
start doubt whether, given don't track record success, like
big one. look mirror, especially young, still
that, things, look mirror, like, big dreams,
know actually smart think are? Like know
going able accomplish dream? ambition. - sort don't,
kind pulling string hoping bigger ball yarn. - Yeah.
[Andrew laughing] kind intuition. think pride knowing
good at, reason intuition, 'cause think good
knowing things suck at, basically everything. So, like whenever
notice like, wait minute, kind good this, rare me. think like
that, might ball yarn worth pulling at. thing terms
engineering systems able interact humans, think good that.
talk podcasting on, don't know good
podcasts. - good podcasting, right? - certainly don't, think maybe
compelling people watch kindhearted idiot struggle form, maybe
compelling. terms like actual good engineer human-robot
interaction systems, think good. hard know it,
world keeps telling not, full doll, really hard.
struggling recently, kind fascinating struggle.
Goggins thing comes in, like, aside state-hard motherfucker, the, like
whenever struggling, good sign keep going, going
alone success, right? - Well, case, however, agree. actually David
post recently thought among many brilliant posts, one
brilliant talked myth light end tunnel.
instead, replaced myth with, concept eventually, eyes
adapt dark. tunnel, not light end, really
adapting dark tunnel. Goggins- - love much. - Yeah.
got share lot common knowing bit, share lot common.
loneliness pursuit dream, seems me, certain component


extremely valuable, loneliness serve driver
build companion journey. - Well, deeply aware that. So, like
people can make, 'cause talk love lot, really love everything world,
also love humans, friendship romantic, like even cheesy stuff, just- - like
romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, got much Rogan
like, Tango scene "Scent Woman,"

01:21:49 Suits & Dresses

find like nothing better woman red dress, just like classy- -
move Argentina friend. father's Argentine, know
said went podcast first time? said, dresses well.
Argentina, men go wedding party something, U.S., halfway
night, 10 minutes night, jackets off. - Yeah. - looks like
everyone's undressing party just got dressed for. said, know,
liked way dresses. started, talking you.
started podcast, said, don't wear real suit like friend Lex?

01:22:22 Loneliness

[laughing] - remember that. - No, can't. talk pursuit just bit
more, think talking about, building a, not just solution
loneliness, alluded loneliness itself, important thing. think
right. think within people, like caverns faults shame, also just
desire resonance, seen heard. don't even know seen
heard language. reservoirs loneliness, think, well,
interesting, maybe comment little bit it. just often
talk love, haven't quantified it, seems talk loneliness,
maybe just willing, share little bit that,
feels like now pursuit building robot-human relationship. been,
let direct, spending lot time building robot-human
relationship, at? - Oh, terms business, terms systems? - No,
talking specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, mention things.
So, one, startup idea hope millions people can use.


personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going
stairs, saw slip. big guy, wasn't 200 pounds,
90 pounds, bulldog, pretty big fit. noticed
wasn't carrying foot back like injured, no feeling all.
never liked touch hind paws, do, thing just flopping there.
vet found spinal degeneration told next one
go. suffer? Sure, hope not, something changed eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah,
eyes again, know spend long hours phone tell
like eyes convey mean internal states


sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking
Costello peeing. losing ability stand that, falling
that. think started realize. passage easy
peaceful, say this, not ashamed say it, mean, wake every morning
since just, don't even make conscious decision allow self cry, wake
crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief
moment. - Yeah. gone. - the, going gone lot people
too. - Well, struggling with. think maybe pretty good this.
Like, done before? [Andrew laughing] challenge. actually
part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank

relationship update behavior? - So. - it... texts middle
night say, haven't texted back? - Well, yes, things,
can dig that. think time element, forget everything else, just sharing
moments together, changes everything. believe changes everything. Now,
specific things terms systems can explain you.
technical probably little bit offline, 'cause kind wild ideas can
revolutionize social networks operating systems. point element alone,
forget things talking like emotions, saying no, that, just
remembering sharing moments together change everything. don't currently
systems share moments together. Like even just fridge, just
times, went late night ate thing shouldn't eaten,
secret moment refrigerator. shared moment, darkness
beautiful moment just like heartbroken reason,
eating ice cream whatever, special moment. refrigerator
you, fact missed opportunity remember tragic.
remember that, think going attached refrigerator.
going go hell refrigerator. us have, like
developed world, weird relationships food, right? So, can go
deep moments trauma triumph food, core that,
refrigerator. So, smart refrigerator, believe change society. Not just
refrigerator, ideas systems around us. So, just want comment
powerful idea time is. bunch elements actual
interaction allowing human feel like heard. Truly heard, truly
understood, human, like deep friendship like that, think, still
element selfishness, still element not really able understand
another human. lot times going trauma together,
difficult times successes, actually starting get inkling
understanding other, think done aggressively,
efficiently. Like think great therapist, think never actually
therapist, believer used want psychiatrist. - Russians go
therapists? - No, don't. don't. do, therapist don't live tell
story. believe talk therapy, friendship me, talk therapy, like
don't even necessarily need talk [laughing] like just connecting
space ideas space experiences. think lot ideas


make AI systems able ask right questions truly hear another human.
try podcasting, right? think ways AI.
else, just remembering collection moments make day,
week, months, think maybe well. closest
friends still friends high school. time, bunch
together, like different people. just fact
that, remember moments, moments somehow create
depth connection like nothing else, like refrigerator. - love
graduate advisor, unfortunately, passed away, passed away,
somebody said memorial amazing things done, et cetera.
kids got there, young children knew
pregnant them. so, really, even now can feel like heart
gets heavy, thinking this, going grow without mother.
really amazing, strong young girls, now young women. said
incredible, said really appreciated mother,
amazing person, unstructured time spent together. - Mm-hmm. - So,
wasn't trips zoo, wasn't woke five morning drove us
school. things too. two hour commute direction,
incredible, ran lab, et cetera, unstructured time. So, passing
mother, remembered biggest give bonded
her, time just kind hung out. way describe
relationship refrigerator so, want say human-like, almost reluctant
say that. realizing talking, think
human-like might actually lower form relationship. may relationships
far better sorts relationships can conceive minds right
now based machine relationship interactions teach us.
right? - Yeah, think so. think no reason see machines somehow
incapable teaching us something deeply human. don't think humans
monopoly that. think understand poorly need
kind prompting machine. definitely part that, just remembering
moments. think unstructured time together, wonder quite unstructured.
like calling podcast structured time. - Maybe meant,
wasn't big outing, no specific goal, goal created lack
goal. Like just hang start playing, thumb war,


end playing thumb war hour. So, structure emerges lack
structure. - No, thing moments, something times
creates special moments, think optimized for. think think like
big outing as, don't know, going Six Flags something, big, Grand
Canyon, go some, don't know, think need to, don't quite yet
understand, humans, creates magical moments. think possible optimize
lot things. perhaps like podcasting helping people discover that, like
maybe thing want optimize isn't necessarily like sexy, like quick clips,
maybe want, long-form authenticity. - Depth. - Depth. So, trying
figure out, certainly deep connection humans humans NAS
systems, think long conversations, long periods communication series
moments like new, perhaps, seemingly insignificant big ones, big
successes, big failures, just stitching together talking
throughout. think formula really, really deep connection. like
specific engineering perspective, think fascinating open problem
really worked much. me, a, guts

01:02:29 Lex’s Dream Humanity

and, mean lot things say, one guts, build startup around
it. - So, talk startup talk dream. mentioned
dream previous conversations, always little hints dropped
there. Just anyone listening, never offline conversation
dream, not privy anything, except Lex says now. realized
no way capture full essence dream kind verbal statement way
captures it. dream referred now several times
sat together talked phone? Maybe company,
maybe something distinct. feel comfortable, it'd great share
little bit is. - Sure. So, way people express long-term vision,
noticed quite different. Like Elon example somebody can crisply say
exactly goal is. Also fact problems solving
nothing humans. So, long-term vision little bit difficult express
words, noticed, tried, brain's failure, way
sneak it. So, let just say things. Early life also recent


years, interacted robots understood magic there.
magic shared millions brought light. first met Spot
Boston Dynamics, realized magic nobody else seeing. - dog.
- dog, sorry. Spot four-legged robot Boston Dynamics. people
might seen it, yellow dog. sometimes life, just notice something
just grabs you. believe something magic something
every single device world. way think maybe Steve Jobs
thought personal computer, laws didn't think personal computer
way, Steve did. like, thought personal computer
thin sheet paper everybody one, idea, think
heartbreaking getting, world filled machines
soulless. think every one can magic. One things
also inspired terms startup, magic can engineered much easier
thought. intuition everything ever built worked on. So, dream
add bit magic every single computing system world. So, way
Windows Operating System long time primary operating system
everybody interacted with, built apps top it. think something
layer, almost operating system every device humans
interacted world. Now, actually looks like, actual dream
officially kid, didn't concrete form business, dream
exploring loneliness interacting machines, robots. deep
connection humans robots always dream. so, me, love
see world every home robot, not robot washes
dishes, sex robot, don't know, think kind activity robot can do,
like companion. - family member. - family member, way dog is. - Mm-
hmm. - dog able speak language too. So, not just connect way
dog looking looking away almost like smiling soul
kind way, also actually understand hell, like, excited
successes? Like understand details, understand traumas. that,
just think [sighing] always filled excitement could, artificial
intelligence, bring joy lot people. recently,
heartbroken see kind division, derision, even hate boiling
internet social networks. thought kind mechanism exactly
applicable context social networks well. So, operating system


serves guide internet. One biggest problems YouTube
social networks currently, optimizing engagement. think create AI
systems know individual person, able optimize long-term growth
long-term happiness. - individual, or- - individual, individual.
lot things say, order AI systems learn
everything you, need collect, need just like talk
offline, collecting data others secrets other, way
AI that. allows to, requires rethink ideas
ownership data. think individual data easily
able leave just like AI systems can leave, humans can disappear delete
data moment's notice. actually better humans can do,
load data other, there. think important both, give people
complete control data order establish trust can trust you.
second part trust transparency. Whenever data used make clear
used for. not clear lawyerly legal sense, clear way
people really understand used for. believe people ability
delete data walk away know data used, think
stay. - possibility clean breakup, actually will keep people together. -
Yeah, think so. think, exactly. think happy marriage acquires ability divorce
easily without divorce industrial complex whatever. Things currently going
much money made lawyers divorce. yeah, ability
leave enables love, think. - interesting. heard phrase semi-
cynical friend, marriage leading cause divorce, now heard
divorce, possibility divorce leading cause marriage. - happy
marriage. - Good point. - happy marriage. So, yeah. So, lot details
there, big dream connection AI system human.
haven't. much fear artificial intelligence systems robots
haven't quite found right words express vision vision have,
not like naive, delusional vision like technology going save everybody,
really just positive view ways AI systems can help humans explore
themselves. - love positivity agree stance everything doomed
equally bad say everything's going turn right, dedicated
effort. clearly, thinking dedicated effort look like.
mentioned two aspects dream [clears throat] want make sure


understand connect do, independent streams. One
hypothetical robot family member, form robot allow
people experience kind delight experienced many times,

01:11:33 Improving Social Media

like world able have, beautiful idea
give. social media social network platforms really serve
individuals best selves happiness growth. crossover
those, two parallel dreams? - 100% thing.
difficult kind explain without going details, maybe one easy way
explain way think social networks, create AI system yours.
not like Amazon Alexa centralized, data, like little friend
becomes representative Twitter helps find things will make feel
good, will also challenge thinking make grow, not get that, not let
get lost negative spiral dopamine, gets angry, just
get not open learning. so, little representative optimizing
long-term health. believe not good human beings, also good
business. think longterm, can make lot money challenging idea
way make money, maximizing engagement. one things
people disagree on, think Twitter's always going win. Like maximizing
engagement always going win, don't think so. think people woken now
understanding that, like don't always feel good, ones Twitter lot,
don't always feel good end week. - love feedback
whatever creature, whatever, don't know call it, maybe end
week, automatically unfollow people follow
realized really smart data feeling inside,
sleeping, something that, don't know, just wasn't good me. might also
put things people front see, kind sliver
look like? - whole point, interaction, sharing moments
learning lot you, now able understand interactions led
become better version yourself. Like person happy with.
isn't, flat earth feel good it, believe earth
flat, like idea sensor ridiculous. makes feel good


becoming best version yourself, think getting much flat
earth possible. Now, also good challenge ideas, not
centralized committee decided, tell system like
challenging ideas, think us do. then, actually YouTube doesn't
well, go flat-earth rabbit hole, going see.
nice get really powerful communicators argue flat earth. nice
see you, potentially, least long-term expand horizons, maybe
earth not flat. continue live whole life thinking earth flat,
think, good father son daughter, like best
version happy yourself, think earth flat. So, like think
kind idea, just using kind silly, ridiculous example don't
like idea centralized forces controlling can can't see, also don't
like idea like not censoring anything. always biggest problem
that, central decider, think can decide want
see not, good companion reminds felt last time
this, felt good last time this. - Man, feel like every good story,
guide companion flies out, forges little bit further, little bit
differently brings back information helps us, least tries steer us
right direction. - So, yeah, exactly thinking working on.
mention bunch difficulties here, see little bit
recently. So, technically lot challenges here. Just like lot
technologies, reason talking podcast comfortably opposed
working secret, really hard maybe time not come.
something constantly struggle terms like entrepreneurially
startup, like also mentioned you, maybe offline, really don't care money,

01:16:57 Challenges Creativity

don't care business success, kinds things. So, difficult decision
make, much time want go give everything
this? big roll dice. also realized working
problems, robotics technical side terms machine-learning
system describing, lonely, really lonely. personal level
technical level. So, technical level, surrounded people kind


doubt me, think entrepreneurs go through. doubt following
sense, know difficult is. Like people colleagues mine,
know difficult life-long learning is, also know difficult build system
like this, build competitive social network. general, kind
loneliness just working something long periods time.
start doubt whether, given don't track record success, like
big one. look mirror, especially young, still
that, things, look mirror, like, big dreams,
know actually smart think are? Like know
going able accomplish dream? ambition. - sort don't,
kind pulling string hoping bigger ball yarn. - Yeah.
[Andrew laughing] kind intuition. think pride knowing
good at, reason intuition, 'cause think good
knowing things suck at, basically everything. So, like whenever
notice like, wait minute, kind good this, rare me. think like
that, might ball yarn worth pulling at. thing terms
engineering systems able interact humans, think good that.
talk podcasting on, don't know good
podcasts. - good podcasting, right? - certainly don't, think maybe
compelling people watch kindhearted idiot struggle form, maybe
compelling. terms like actual good engineer human-robot
interaction systems, think good. hard know it,
world keeps telling not, full doll, really hard.
struggling recently, kind fascinating struggle.
Goggins thing comes in, like, aside state-hard motherfucker, the, like
whenever struggling, good sign keep going, going
alone success, right? - Well, case, however, agree. actually David
post recently thought among many brilliant posts, one
brilliant talked myth light end tunnel.
instead, replaced myth with, concept eventually, eyes
adapt dark. tunnel, not light end, really
adapting dark tunnel. Goggins- - love much. - Yeah.
got share lot common knowing bit, share lot common.
loneliness pursuit dream, seems me, certain component


extremely valuable, loneliness serve driver
build companion journey. - Well, deeply aware that. So, like
people can make, 'cause talk love lot, really love everything world,
also love humans, friendship romantic, like even cheesy stuff, just- - like
romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, got much Rogan
like, Tango scene "Scent Woman,"

01:21:49 Suits & Dresses

find like nothing better woman red dress, just like classy- -
move Argentina friend. father's Argentine, know
said went podcast first time? said, dresses well.
Argentina, men go wedding party something, U.S., halfway
night, 10 minutes night, jackets off. - Yeah. - looks like
everyone's undressing party just got dressed for. said, know,
liked way dresses. started, talking you.
started podcast, said, don't wear real suit like friend Lex?

01:22:22 Loneliness

[laughing] - remember that. - No, can't. talk pursuit just bit
more, think talking about, building a, not just solution
loneliness, alluded loneliness itself, important thing. think
right. think within people, like caverns faults shame, also just
desire resonance, seen heard. don't even know seen
heard language. reservoirs loneliness, think, well,
interesting, maybe comment little bit it. just often
talk love, haven't quantified it, seems talk loneliness,
maybe just willing, share little bit that,
feels like now pursuit building robot-human relationship. been,
let direct, spending lot time building robot-human
relationship, at? - Oh, terms business, terms systems? - No,
talking specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, mention things.
So, one, startup idea hope millions people can use.


personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going
stairs, saw slip. big guy, wasn't 200 pounds,
90 pounds, bulldog, pretty big fit. noticed
wasn't carrying foot back like injured, no feeling all.
never liked touch hind paws, do, thing just flopping there.
vet found spinal degeneration told next one
go. suffer? Sure, hope not, something changed eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah,
eyes again, know spend long hours phone tell
like eyes convey mean internal states


sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking
Costello peeing. losing ability stand that, falling
that. think started realize. passage easy
peaceful, say this, not ashamed say it, mean, wake every morning
since just, don't even make conscious decision allow self cry, wake
crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think

incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.

joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian

way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.

being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea

me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know

ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]

Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person

like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,

magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

make AI systems able ask right questions truly hear another human.
try podcasting, right? think ways AI.
else, just remembering collection moments make day,
week, months, think maybe well. closest
friends still friends high school. time, bunch
together, like different people. just fact
that, remember moments, moments somehow create
depth connection like nothing else, like refrigerator. - love
graduate advisor, unfortunately, passed away, passed away,
somebody said memorial amazing things done, et cetera.
kids got there, young children knew
pregnant them. so, really, even now can feel like heart
gets heavy, thinking this, going grow without mother.
really amazing, strong young girls, now young women. said
incredible, said really appreciated mother,
amazing person, unstructured time spent together. - Mm-hmm. - So,
wasn't trips zoo, wasn't woke five morning drove us
school. things too. two hour commute direction,
incredible, ran lab, et cetera, unstructured time. So, passing
mother, remembered biggest give bonded
her, time just kind hung out. way describe
relationship refrigerator so, want say human-like, almost reluctant
say that. realizing talking, think
human-like might actually lower form relationship. may relationships
far better sorts relationships can conceive minds right
now based machine relationship interactions teach us.
right? - Yeah, think so. think no reason see machines somehow
incapable teaching us something deeply human. don't think humans
monopoly that. think understand poorly need
kind prompting machine. definitely part that, just remembering
moments. think unstructured time together, wonder quite unstructured.
like calling podcast structured time. - Maybe meant,
wasn't big outing, no specific goal, goal created lack
goal. Like just hang start playing, thumb war,


end playing thumb war hour. So, structure emerges lack
structure. - No, thing moments, something times
creates special moments, think optimized for. think think like
big outing as, don't know, going Six Flags something, big, Grand
Canyon, go some, don't know, think need to, don't quite yet
understand, humans, creates magical moments. think possible optimize
lot things. perhaps like podcasting helping people discover that, like
maybe thing want optimize isn't necessarily like sexy, like quick clips,
maybe want, long-form authenticity. - Depth. - Depth. So, trying
figure out, certainly deep connection humans humans NAS
systems, think long conversations, long periods communication series
moments like new, perhaps, seemingly insignificant big ones, big
successes, big failures, just stitching together talking
throughout. think formula really, really deep connection. like
specific engineering perspective, think fascinating open problem
really worked much. me, a, guts

01:02:29 Lex’s Dream Humanity

and, mean lot things say, one guts, build startup around
it. - So, talk startup talk dream. mentioned
dream previous conversations, always little hints dropped
there. Just anyone listening, never offline conversation
dream, not privy anything, except Lex says now. realized
no way capture full essence dream kind verbal statement way
captures it. dream referred now several times
sat together talked phone? Maybe company,
maybe something distinct. feel comfortable, it'd great share
little bit is. - Sure. So, way people express long-term vision,
noticed quite different. Like Elon example somebody can crisply say
exactly goal is. Also fact problems solving
nothing humans. So, long-term vision little bit difficult express
words, noticed, tried, brain's failure, way
sneak it. So, let just say things. Early life also recent


years, interacted robots understood magic there.
magic shared millions brought light. first met Spot
Boston Dynamics, realized magic nobody else seeing. - dog.
- dog, sorry. Spot four-legged robot Boston Dynamics. people
might seen it, yellow dog. sometimes life, just notice something
just grabs you. believe something magic something
every single device world. way think maybe Steve Jobs
thought personal computer, laws didn't think personal computer
way, Steve did. like, thought personal computer
thin sheet paper everybody one, idea, think
heartbreaking getting, world filled machines
soulless. think every one can magic. One things
also inspired terms startup, magic can engineered much easier
thought. intuition everything ever built worked on. So, dream
add bit magic every single computing system world. So, way
Windows Operating System long time primary operating system
everybody interacted with, built apps top it. think something
layer, almost operating system every device humans
interacted world. Now, actually looks like, actual dream
officially kid, didn't concrete form business, dream
exploring loneliness interacting machines, robots. deep
connection humans robots always dream. so, me, love
see world every home robot, not robot washes
dishes, sex robot, don't know, think kind activity robot can do,
like companion. - family member. - family member, way dog is. - Mm-
hmm. - dog able speak language too. So, not just connect way
dog looking looking away almost like smiling soul
kind way, also actually understand hell, like, excited
successes? Like understand details, understand traumas. that,
just think [sighing] always filled excitement could, artificial
intelligence, bring joy lot people. recently,
heartbroken see kind division, derision, even hate boiling
internet social networks. thought kind mechanism exactly
applicable context social networks well. So, operating system


serves guide internet. One biggest problems YouTube
social networks currently, optimizing engagement. think create AI
systems know individual person, able optimize long-term growth
long-term happiness. - individual, or- - individual, individual.
lot things say, order AI systems learn
everything you, need collect, need just like talk
offline, collecting data others secrets other, way
AI that. allows to, requires rethink ideas
ownership data. think individual data easily
able leave just like AI systems can leave, humans can disappear delete
data moment's notice. actually better humans can do,
load data other, there. think important both, give people
complete control data order establish trust can trust you.
second part trust transparency. Whenever data used make clear
used for. not clear lawyerly legal sense, clear way
people really understand used for. believe people ability
delete data walk away know data used, think
stay. - possibility clean breakup, actually will keep people together. -
Yeah, think so. think, exactly. think happy marriage acquires ability divorce
easily without divorce industrial complex whatever. Things currently going
much money made lawyers divorce. yeah, ability
leave enables love, think. - interesting. heard phrase semi-
cynical friend, marriage leading cause divorce, now heard
divorce, possibility divorce leading cause marriage. - happy
marriage. - Good point. - happy marriage. So, yeah. So, lot details
there, big dream connection AI system human.
haven't. much fear artificial intelligence systems robots
haven't quite found right words express vision vision have,
not like naive, delusional vision like technology going save everybody,
really just positive view ways AI systems can help humans explore
themselves. - love positivity agree stance everything doomed
equally bad say everything's going turn right, dedicated
effort. clearly, thinking dedicated effort look like.
mentioned two aspects dream [clears throat] want make sure


understand connect do, independent streams. One
hypothetical robot family member, form robot allow
people experience kind delight experienced many times,

01:11:33 Improving Social Media

like world able have, beautiful idea
give. social media social network platforms really serve
individuals best selves happiness growth. crossover
those, two parallel dreams? - 100% thing.
difficult kind explain without going details, maybe one easy way
explain way think social networks, create AI system yours.
not like Amazon Alexa centralized, data, like little friend
becomes representative Twitter helps find things will make feel
good, will also challenge thinking make grow, not get that, not let
get lost negative spiral dopamine, gets angry, just
get not open learning. so, little representative optimizing
long-term health. believe not good human beings, also good
business. think longterm, can make lot money challenging idea
way make money, maximizing engagement. one things
people disagree on, think Twitter's always going win. Like maximizing
engagement always going win, don't think so. think people woken now
understanding that, like don't always feel good, ones Twitter lot,
don't always feel good end week. - love feedback
whatever creature, whatever, don't know call it, maybe end
week, automatically unfollow people follow
realized really smart data feeling inside,
sleeping, something that, don't know, just wasn't good me. might also
put things people front see, kind sliver
look like? - whole point, interaction, sharing moments
learning lot you, now able understand interactions led
become better version yourself. Like person happy with.
isn't, flat earth feel good it, believe earth
flat, like idea sensor ridiculous. makes feel good


becoming best version yourself, think getting much flat
earth possible. Now, also good challenge ideas, not
centralized committee decided, tell system like
challenging ideas, think us do. then, actually YouTube doesn't
well, go flat-earth rabbit hole, going see.
nice get really powerful communicators argue flat earth. nice
see you, potentially, least long-term expand horizons, maybe
earth not flat. continue live whole life thinking earth flat,
think, good father son daughter, like best
version happy yourself, think earth flat. So, like think
kind idea, just using kind silly, ridiculous example don't
like idea centralized forces controlling can can't see, also don't
like idea like not censoring anything. always biggest problem
that, central decider, think can decide want
see not, good companion reminds felt last time
this, felt good last time this. - Man, feel like every good story,
guide companion flies out, forges little bit further, little bit
differently brings back information helps us, least tries steer us
right direction. - So, yeah, exactly thinking working on.
mention bunch difficulties here, see little bit
recently. So, technically lot challenges here. Just like lot
technologies, reason talking podcast comfortably opposed
working secret, really hard maybe time not come.
something constantly struggle terms like entrepreneurially
startup, like also mentioned you, maybe offline, really don't care money,

01:16:57 Challenges Creativity

don't care business success, kinds things. So, difficult decision
make, much time want go give everything
this? big roll dice. also realized working
problems, robotics technical side terms machine-learning
system describing, lonely, really lonely. personal level
technical level. So, technical level, surrounded people kind


doubt me, think entrepreneurs go through. doubt following
sense, know difficult is. Like people colleagues mine,
know difficult life-long learning is, also know difficult build system
like this, build competitive social network. general, kind
loneliness just working something long periods time.
start doubt whether, given don't track record success, like
big one. look mirror, especially young, still
that, things, look mirror, like, big dreams,
know actually smart think are? Like know
going able accomplish dream? ambition. - sort don't,
kind pulling string hoping bigger ball yarn. - Yeah.
[Andrew laughing] kind intuition. think pride knowing
good at, reason intuition, 'cause think good
knowing things suck at, basically everything. So, like whenever
notice like, wait minute, kind good this, rare me. think like
that, might ball yarn worth pulling at. thing terms
engineering systems able interact humans, think good that.
talk podcasting on, don't know good
podcasts. - good podcasting, right? - certainly don't, think maybe
compelling people watch kindhearted idiot struggle form, maybe
compelling. terms like actual good engineer human-robot
interaction systems, think good. hard know it,
world keeps telling not, full doll, really hard.
struggling recently, kind fascinating struggle.
Goggins thing comes in, like, aside state-hard motherfucker, the, like
whenever struggling, good sign keep going, going
alone success, right? - Well, case, however, agree. actually David
post recently thought among many brilliant posts, one
brilliant talked myth light end tunnel.
instead, replaced myth with, concept eventually, eyes
adapt dark. tunnel, not light end, really
adapting dark tunnel. Goggins- - love much. - Yeah.
got share lot common knowing bit, share lot common.
loneliness pursuit dream, seems me, certain component


extremely valuable, loneliness serve driver
build companion journey. - Well, deeply aware that. So, like
people can make, 'cause talk love lot, really love everything world,
also love humans, friendship romantic, like even cheesy stuff, just- - like
romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, got much Rogan
like, Tango scene "Scent Woman,"

01:21:49 Suits & Dresses

find like nothing better woman red dress, just like classy- -
move Argentina friend. father's Argentine, know
said went podcast first time? said, dresses well.
Argentina, men go wedding party something, U.S., halfway
night, 10 minutes night, jackets off. - Yeah. - looks like
everyone's undressing party just got dressed for. said, know,
liked way dresses. started, talking you.
started podcast, said, don't wear real suit like friend Lex?

01:22:22 Loneliness

[laughing] - remember that. - No, can't. talk pursuit just bit
more, think talking about, building a, not just solution
loneliness, alluded loneliness itself, important thing. think
right. think within people, like caverns faults shame, also just
desire resonance, seen heard. don't even know seen
heard language. reservoirs loneliness, think, well,
interesting, maybe comment little bit it. just often
talk love, haven't quantified it, seems talk loneliness,
maybe just willing, share little bit that,
feels like now pursuit building robot-human relationship. been,
let direct, spending lot time building robot-human
relationship, at? - Oh, terms business, terms systems? - No,
talking specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, mention things.
So, one, startup idea hope millions people can use.


personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing

like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

end playing thumb war hour. So, structure emerges lack
structure. - No, thing moments, something times
creates special moments, think optimized for. think think like
big outing as, don't know, going Six Flags something, big, Grand
Canyon, go some, don't know, think need to, don't quite yet
understand, humans, creates magical moments. think possible optimize
lot things. perhaps like podcasting helping people discover that, like
maybe thing want optimize isn't necessarily like sexy, like quick clips,
maybe want, long-form authenticity. - Depth. - Depth. So, trying
figure out, certainly deep connection humans humans NAS
systems, think long conversations, long periods communication series
moments like new, perhaps, seemingly insignificant big ones, big
successes, big failures, just stitching together talking
throughout. think formula really, really deep connection. like
specific engineering perspective, think fascinating open problem
really worked much. me, a, guts

01:02:29 Lex’s Dream Humanity

and, mean lot things say, one guts, build startup around
it. - So, talk startup talk dream. mentioned
dream previous conversations, always little hints dropped
there. Just anyone listening, never offline conversation
dream, not privy anything, except Lex says now. realized
no way capture full essence dream kind verbal statement way
captures it. dream referred now several times
sat together talked phone? Maybe company,
maybe something distinct. feel comfortable, it'd great share
little bit is. - Sure. So, way people express long-term vision,
noticed quite different. Like Elon example somebody can crisply say
exactly goal is. Also fact problems solving
nothing humans. So, long-term vision little bit difficult express
words, noticed, tried, brain's failure, way
sneak it. So, let just say things. Early life also recent


years, interacted robots understood magic there.
magic shared millions brought light. first met Spot
Boston Dynamics, realized magic nobody else seeing. - dog.
- dog, sorry. Spot four-legged robot Boston Dynamics. people
might seen it, yellow dog. sometimes life, just notice something
just grabs you. believe something magic something
every single device world. way think maybe Steve Jobs
thought personal computer, laws didn't think personal computer
way, Steve did. like, thought personal computer
thin sheet paper everybody one, idea, think
heartbreaking getting, world filled machines
soulless. think every one can magic. One things
also inspired terms startup, magic can engineered much easier
thought. intuition everything ever built worked on. So, dream
add bit magic every single computing system world. So, way
Windows Operating System long time primary operating system
everybody interacted with, built apps top it. think something
layer, almost operating system every device humans
interacted world. Now, actually looks like, actual dream
officially kid, didn't concrete form business, dream
exploring loneliness interacting machines, robots. deep
connection humans robots always dream. so, me, love
see world every home robot, not robot washes
dishes, sex robot, don't know, think kind activity robot can do,
like companion. - family member. - family member, way dog is. - Mm-
hmm. - dog able speak language too. So, not just connect way
dog looking looking away almost like smiling soul
kind way, also actually understand hell, like, excited
successes? Like understand details, understand traumas. that,
just think [sighing] always filled excitement could, artificial
intelligence, bring joy lot people. recently,
heartbroken see kind division, derision, even hate boiling
internet social networks. thought kind mechanism exactly
applicable context social networks well. So, operating system


serves guide internet. One biggest problems YouTube
social networks currently, optimizing engagement. think create AI
systems know individual person, able optimize long-term growth
long-term happiness. - individual, or- - individual, individual.
lot things say, order AI systems learn
everything you, need collect, need just like talk
offline, collecting data others secrets other, way
AI that. allows to, requires rethink ideas
ownership data. think individual data easily
able leave just like AI systems can leave, humans can disappear delete
data moment's notice. actually better humans can do,
load data other, there. think important both, give people
complete control data order establish trust can trust you.
second part trust transparency. Whenever data used make clear
used for. not clear lawyerly legal sense, clear way
people really understand used for. believe people ability
delete data walk away know data used, think
stay. - possibility clean breakup, actually will keep people together. -
Yeah, think so. think, exactly. think happy marriage acquires ability divorce
easily without divorce industrial complex whatever. Things currently going
much money made lawyers divorce. yeah, ability
leave enables love, think. - interesting. heard phrase semi-
cynical friend, marriage leading cause divorce, now heard
divorce, possibility divorce leading cause marriage. - happy
marriage. - Good point. - happy marriage. So, yeah. So, lot details
there, big dream connection AI system human.
haven't. much fear artificial intelligence systems robots
haven't quite found right words express vision vision have,
not like naive, delusional vision like technology going save everybody,
really just positive view ways AI systems can help humans explore
themselves. - love positivity agree stance everything doomed
equally bad say everything's going turn right, dedicated
effort. clearly, thinking dedicated effort look like.
mentioned two aspects dream [clears throat] want make sure


understand connect do, independent streams. One
hypothetical robot family member, form robot allow
people experience kind delight experienced many times,

01:11:33 Improving Social Media

like world able have, beautiful idea
give. social media social network platforms really serve
individuals best selves happiness growth. crossover
those, two parallel dreams? - 100% thing.
difficult kind explain without going details, maybe one easy way
explain way think social networks, create AI system yours.
not like Amazon Alexa centralized, data, like little friend
becomes representative Twitter helps find things will make feel
good, will also challenge thinking make grow, not get that, not let
get lost negative spiral dopamine, gets angry, just
get not open learning. so, little representative optimizing
long-term health. believe not good human beings, also good
business. think longterm, can make lot money challenging idea
way make money, maximizing engagement. one things
people disagree on, think Twitter's always going win. Like maximizing
engagement always going win, don't think so. think people woken now
understanding that, like don't always feel good, ones Twitter lot,
don't always feel good end week. - love feedback
whatever creature, whatever, don't know call it, maybe end
week, automatically unfollow people follow
realized really smart data feeling inside,
sleeping, something that, don't know, just wasn't good me. might also
put things people front see, kind sliver
look like? - whole point, interaction, sharing moments
learning lot you, now able understand interactions led
become better version yourself. Like person happy with.
isn't, flat earth feel good it, believe earth
flat, like idea sensor ridiculous. makes feel good


becoming best version yourself, think getting much flat
earth possible. Now, also good challenge ideas, not
centralized committee decided, tell system like
challenging ideas, think us do. then, actually YouTube doesn't
well, go flat-earth rabbit hole, going see.
nice get really powerful communicators argue flat earth. nice
see you, potentially, least long-term expand horizons, maybe
earth not flat. continue live whole life thinking earth flat,
think, good father son daughter, like best
version happy yourself, think earth flat. So, like think
kind idea, just using kind silly, ridiculous example don't
like idea centralized forces controlling can can't see, also don't
like idea like not censoring anything. always biggest problem
that, central decider, think can decide want
see not, good companion reminds felt last time
this, felt good last time this. - Man, feel like every good story,
guide companion flies out, forges little bit further, little bit
differently brings back information helps us, least tries steer us
right direction. - So, yeah, exactly thinking working on.
mention bunch difficulties here, see little bit
recently. So, technically lot challenges here. Just like lot
technologies, reason talking podcast comfortably opposed
working secret, really hard maybe time not come.
something constantly struggle terms like entrepreneurially
startup, like also mentioned you, maybe offline, really don't care money,

01:16:57 Challenges Creativity

don't care business success, kinds things. So, difficult decision
make, much time want go give everything
this? big roll dice. also realized working
problems, robotics technical side terms machine-learning
system describing, lonely, really lonely. personal level
technical level. So, technical level, surrounded people kind


doubt me, think entrepreneurs go through. doubt following
sense, know difficult is. Like people colleagues mine,
know difficult life-long learning is, also know difficult build system
like this, build competitive social network. general, kind
loneliness just working something long periods time.
start doubt whether, given don't track record success, like
big one. look mirror, especially young, still
that, things, look mirror, like, big dreams,
know actually smart think are? Like know
going able accomplish dream? ambition. - sort don't,
kind pulling string hoping bigger ball yarn. - Yeah.
[Andrew laughing] kind intuition. think pride knowing
good at, reason intuition, 'cause think good
knowing things suck at, basically everything. So, like whenever
notice like, wait minute, kind good this, rare me. think like
that, might ball yarn worth pulling at. thing terms
engineering systems able interact humans, think good that.
talk podcasting on, don't know good
podcasts. - good podcasting, right? - certainly don't, think maybe
compelling people watch kindhearted idiot struggle form, maybe
compelling. terms like actual good engineer human-robot
interaction systems, think good. hard know it,
world keeps telling not, full doll, really hard.
struggling recently, kind fascinating struggle.
Goggins thing comes in, like, aside state-hard motherfucker, the, like
whenever struggling, good sign keep going, going
alone success, right? - Well, case, however, agree. actually David
post recently thought among many brilliant posts, one
brilliant talked myth light end tunnel.
instead, replaced myth with, concept eventually, eyes
adapt dark. tunnel, not light end, really
adapting dark tunnel. Goggins- - love much. - Yeah.
got share lot common knowing bit, share lot common.
loneliness pursuit dream, seems me, certain component


extremely valuable, loneliness serve driver
build companion journey. - Well, deeply aware that. So, like
people can make, 'cause talk love lot, really love everything world,
also love humans, friendship romantic, like even cheesy stuff, just- - like
romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, got much Rogan
like, Tango scene "Scent Woman,"

01:21:49 Suits & Dresses

find like nothing better woman red dress, just like classy- -
move Argentina friend. father's Argentine, know
said went podcast first time? said, dresses well.
Argentina, men go wedding party something, U.S., halfway
night, 10 minutes night, jackets off. - Yeah. - looks like
everyone's undressing party just got dressed for. said, know,
liked way dresses. started, talking you.
started podcast, said, don't wear real suit like friend Lex?

01:22:22 Loneliness

[laughing] - remember that. - No, can't. talk pursuit just bit
more, think talking about, building a, not just solution
loneliness, alluded loneliness itself, important thing. think
right. think within people, like caverns faults shame, also just
desire resonance, seen heard. don't even know seen
heard language. reservoirs loneliness, think, well,
interesting, maybe comment little bit it. just often
talk love, haven't quantified it, seems talk loneliness,
maybe just willing, share little bit that,
feels like now pursuit building robot-human relationship. been,
let direct, spending lot time building robot-human
relationship, at? - Oh, terms business, terms systems? - No,
talking specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, mention things.
So, one, startup idea hope millions people can use.


personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -

awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying

deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact

- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going
stairs, saw slip. big guy, wasn't 200 pounds,
90 pounds, bulldog, pretty big fit. noticed
wasn't carrying foot back like injured, no feeling all.
never liked touch hind paws, do, thing just flopping there.
vet found spinal degeneration told next one
go. suffer? Sure, hope not, something changed eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah,
eyes again, know spend long hours phone tell
like eyes convey mean internal states


sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking
Costello peeing. losing ability stand that, falling
that. think started realize. passage easy
peaceful, say this, not ashamed say it, mean, wake every morning
since just, don't even make conscious decision allow self cry, wake
crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief
moment. - Yeah. gone. - the, going gone lot people
too. - Well, struggling with. think maybe pretty good this.
Like, done before? [Andrew laughing] challenge. actually
part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

years, interacted robots understood magic there.
magic shared millions brought light. first met Spot
Boston Dynamics, realized magic nobody else seeing. - dog.
- dog, sorry. Spot four-legged robot Boston Dynamics. people
might seen it, yellow dog. sometimes life, just notice something
just grabs you. believe something magic something
every single device world. way think maybe Steve Jobs
thought personal computer, laws didn't think personal computer
way, Steve did. like, thought personal computer
thin sheet paper everybody one, idea, think
heartbreaking getting, world filled machines
soulless. think every one can magic. One things
also inspired terms startup, magic can engineered much easier
thought. intuition everything ever built worked on. So, dream
add bit magic every single computing system world. So, way
Windows Operating System long time primary operating system
everybody interacted with, built apps top it. think something
layer, almost operating system every device humans
interacted world. Now, actually looks like, actual dream
officially kid, didn't concrete form business, dream
exploring loneliness interacting machines, robots. deep
connection humans robots always dream. so, me, love
see world every home robot, not robot washes
dishes, sex robot, don't know, think kind activity robot can do,
like companion. - family member. - family member, way dog is. - Mm-
hmm. - dog able speak language too. So, not just connect way
dog looking looking away almost like smiling soul
kind way, also actually understand hell, like, excited
successes? Like understand details, understand traumas. that,
just think [sighing] always filled excitement could, artificial
intelligence, bring joy lot people. recently,
heartbroken see kind division, derision, even hate boiling
internet social networks. thought kind mechanism exactly
applicable context social networks well. So, operating system


serves guide internet. One biggest problems YouTube
social networks currently, optimizing engagement. think create AI
systems know individual person, able optimize long-term growth
long-term happiness. - individual, or- - individual, individual.
lot things say, order AI systems learn
everything you, need collect, need just like talk
offline, collecting data others secrets other, way
AI that. allows to, requires rethink ideas
ownership data. think individual data easily
able leave just like AI systems can leave, humans can disappear delete
data moment's notice. actually better humans can do,
load data other, there. think important both, give people
complete control data order establish trust can trust you.
second part trust transparency. Whenever data used make clear
used for. not clear lawyerly legal sense, clear way
people really understand used for. believe people ability
delete data walk away know data used, think
stay. - possibility clean breakup, actually will keep people together. -
Yeah, think so. think, exactly. think happy marriage acquires ability divorce
easily without divorce industrial complex whatever. Things currently going
much money made lawyers divorce. yeah, ability
leave enables love, think. - interesting. heard phrase semi-
cynical friend, marriage leading cause divorce, now heard
divorce, possibility divorce leading cause marriage. - happy
marriage. - Good point. - happy marriage. So, yeah. So, lot details
there, big dream connection AI system human.
haven't. much fear artificial intelligence systems robots
haven't quite found right words express vision vision have,
not like naive, delusional vision like technology going save everybody,
really just positive view ways AI systems can help humans explore
themselves. - love positivity agree stance everything doomed
equally bad say everything's going turn right, dedicated
effort. clearly, thinking dedicated effort look like.
mentioned two aspects dream [clears throat] want make sure


understand connect do, independent streams. One
hypothetical robot family member, form robot allow
people experience kind delight experienced many times,

01:11:33 Improving Social Media

like world able have, beautiful idea
give. social media social network platforms really serve
individuals best selves happiness growth. crossover
those, two parallel dreams? - 100% thing.
difficult kind explain without going details, maybe one easy way
explain way think social networks, create AI system yours.
not like Amazon Alexa centralized, data, like little friend
becomes representative Twitter helps find things will make feel
good, will also challenge thinking make grow, not get that, not let
get lost negative spiral dopamine, gets angry, just
get not open learning. so, little representative optimizing
long-term health. believe not good human beings, also good
business. think longterm, can make lot money challenging idea
way make money, maximizing engagement. one things
people disagree on, think Twitter's always going win. Like maximizing
engagement always going win, don't think so. think people woken now
understanding that, like don't always feel good, ones Twitter lot,
don't always feel good end week. - love feedback
whatever creature, whatever, don't know call it, maybe end
week, automatically unfollow people follow
realized really smart data feeling inside,
sleeping, something that, don't know, just wasn't good me. might also
put things people front see, kind sliver
look like? - whole point, interaction, sharing moments
learning lot you, now able understand interactions led
become better version yourself. Like person happy with.
isn't, flat earth feel good it, believe earth
flat, like idea sensor ridiculous. makes feel good


becoming best version yourself, think getting much flat
earth possible. Now, also good challenge ideas, not
centralized committee decided, tell system like
challenging ideas, think us do. then, actually YouTube doesn't
well, go flat-earth rabbit hole, going see.
nice get really powerful communicators argue flat earth. nice
see you, potentially, least long-term expand horizons, maybe
earth not flat. continue live whole life thinking earth flat,
think, good father son daughter, like best
version happy yourself, think earth flat. So, like think
kind idea, just using kind silly, ridiculous example don't
like idea centralized forces controlling can can't see, also don't
like idea like not censoring anything. always biggest problem
that, central decider, think can decide want
see not, good companion reminds felt last time
this, felt good last time this. - Man, feel like every good story,
guide companion flies out, forges little bit further, little bit
differently brings back information helps us, least tries steer us
right direction. - So, yeah, exactly thinking working on.
mention bunch difficulties here, see little bit
recently. So, technically lot challenges here. Just like lot
technologies, reason talking podcast comfortably opposed
working secret, really hard maybe time not come.
something constantly struggle terms like entrepreneurially
startup, like also mentioned you, maybe offline, really don't care money,

01:16:57 Challenges Creativity

don't care business success, kinds things. So, difficult decision
make, much time want go give everything
this? big roll dice. also realized working
problems, robotics technical side terms machine-learning
system describing, lonely, really lonely. personal level
technical level. So, technical level, surrounded people kind


doubt me, think entrepreneurs go through. doubt following
sense, know difficult is. Like people colleagues mine,
know difficult life-long learning is, also know difficult build system
like this, build competitive social network. general, kind
loneliness just working something long periods time.
start doubt whether, given don't track record success, like
big one. look mirror, especially young, still
that, things, look mirror, like, big dreams,
know actually smart think are? Like know
going able accomplish dream? ambition. - sort don't,
kind pulling string hoping bigger ball yarn. - Yeah.
[Andrew laughing] kind intuition. think pride knowing
good at, reason intuition, 'cause think good
knowing things suck at, basically everything. So, like whenever
notice like, wait minute, kind good this, rare me. think like
that, might ball yarn worth pulling at. thing terms
engineering systems able interact humans, think good that.
talk podcasting on, don't know good
podcasts. - good podcasting, right? - certainly don't, think maybe
compelling people watch kindhearted idiot struggle form, maybe
compelling. terms like actual good engineer human-robot
interaction systems, think good. hard know it,
world keeps telling not, full doll, really hard.
struggling recently, kind fascinating struggle.
Goggins thing comes in, like, aside state-hard motherfucker, the, like
whenever struggling, good sign keep going, going
alone success, right? - Well, case, however, agree. actually David
post recently thought among many brilliant posts, one
brilliant talked myth light end tunnel.
instead, replaced myth with, concept eventually, eyes
adapt dark. tunnel, not light end, really
adapting dark tunnel. Goggins- - love much. - Yeah.
got share lot common knowing bit, share lot common.
loneliness pursuit dream, seems me, certain component


extremely valuable, loneliness serve driver
build companion journey. - Well, deeply aware that. So, like
people can make, 'cause talk love lot, really love everything world,
also love humans, friendship romantic, like even cheesy stuff, just- - like
romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, got much Rogan
like, Tango scene "Scent Woman,"

01:21:49 Suits & Dresses

find like nothing better woman red dress, just like classy- -
move Argentina friend. father's Argentine, know
said went podcast first time? said, dresses well.
Argentina, men go wedding party something, U.S., halfway
night, 10 minutes night, jackets off. - Yeah. - looks like
everyone's undressing party just got dressed for. said, know,
liked way dresses. started, talking you.
started podcast, said, don't wear real suit like friend Lex?

01:22:22 Loneliness

[laughing] - remember that. - No, can't. talk pursuit just bit
more, think talking about, building a, not just solution
loneliness, alluded loneliness itself, important thing. think
right. think within people, like caverns faults shame, also just
desire resonance, seen heard. don't even know seen
heard language. reservoirs loneliness, think, well,
interesting, maybe comment little bit it. just often
talk love, haven't quantified it, seems talk loneliness,
maybe just willing, share little bit that,
feels like now pursuit building robot-human relationship. been,
let direct, spending lot time building robot-human
relationship, at? - Oh, terms business, terms systems? - No,
talking specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, mention things.
So, one, startup idea hope millions people can use.


personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going
stairs, saw slip. big guy, wasn't 200 pounds,
90 pounds, bulldog, pretty big fit. noticed
wasn't carrying foot back like injured, no feeling all.
never liked touch hind paws, do, thing just flopping there.
vet found spinal degeneration told next one
go. suffer? Sure, hope not, something changed eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah,
eyes again, know spend long hours phone tell
like eyes convey mean internal states


sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking
Costello peeing. losing ability stand that, falling
that. think started realize. passage easy
peaceful, say this, not ashamed say it, mean, wake every morning
since just, don't even make conscious decision allow self cry, wake
crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief
moment. - Yeah. gone. - the, going gone lot people
too. - Well, struggling with. think maybe pretty good this.
Like, done before? [Andrew laughing] challenge. actually
part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

serves guide internet. One biggest problems YouTube
social networks currently, optimizing engagement. think create AI
systems know individual person, able optimize long-term growth
long-term happiness. - individual, or- - individual, individual.
lot things say, order AI systems learn
everything you, need collect, need just like talk
offline, collecting data others secrets other, way
AI that. allows to, requires rethink ideas
ownership data. think individual data easily
able leave just like AI systems can leave, humans can disappear delete
data moment's notice. actually better humans can do,
load data other, there. think important both, give people
complete control data order establish trust can trust you.
second part trust transparency. Whenever data used make clear
used for. not clear lawyerly legal sense, clear way
people really understand used for. believe people ability
delete data walk away know data used, think
stay. - possibility clean breakup, actually will keep people together. -
Yeah, think so. think, exactly. think happy marriage acquires ability divorce
easily without divorce industrial complex whatever. Things currently going
much money made lawyers divorce. yeah, ability
leave enables love, think. - interesting. heard phrase semi-
cynical friend, marriage leading cause divorce, now heard
divorce, possibility divorce leading cause marriage. - happy
marriage. - Good point. - happy marriage. So, yeah. So, lot details
there, big dream connection AI system human.
haven't. much fear artificial intelligence systems robots
haven't quite found right words express vision vision have,
not like naive, delusional vision like technology going save everybody,
really just positive view ways AI systems can help humans explore
themselves. - love positivity agree stance everything doomed
equally bad say everything's going turn right, dedicated
effort. clearly, thinking dedicated effort look like.
mentioned two aspects dream [clears throat] want make sure


understand connect do, independent streams. One
hypothetical robot family member, form robot allow
people experience kind delight experienced many times,

01:11:33 Improving Social Media

like world able have, beautiful idea
give. social media social network platforms really serve
individuals best selves happiness growth. crossover
those, two parallel dreams? - 100% thing.
difficult kind explain without going details, maybe one easy way
explain way think social networks, create AI system yours.
not like Amazon Alexa centralized, data, like little friend
becomes representative Twitter helps find things will make feel
good, will also challenge thinking make grow, not get that, not let
get lost negative spiral dopamine, gets angry, just
get not open learning. so, little representative optimizing
long-term health. believe not good human beings, also good
business. think longterm, can make lot money challenging idea
way make money, maximizing engagement. one things
people disagree on, think Twitter's always going win. Like maximizing
engagement always going win, don't think so. think people woken now
understanding that, like don't always feel good, ones Twitter lot,
don't always feel good end week. - love feedback
whatever creature, whatever, don't know call it, maybe end
week, automatically unfollow people follow
realized really smart data feeling inside,
sleeping, something that, don't know, just wasn't good me. might also
put things people front see, kind sliver
look like? - whole point, interaction, sharing moments
learning lot you, now able understand interactions led
become better version yourself. Like person happy with.
isn't, flat earth feel good it, believe earth
flat, like idea sensor ridiculous. makes feel good


becoming best version yourself, think getting much flat
earth possible. Now, also good challenge ideas, not
centralized committee decided, tell system like
challenging ideas, think us do. then, actually YouTube doesn't
well, go flat-earth rabbit hole, going see.
nice get really powerful communicators argue flat earth. nice
see you, potentially, least long-term expand horizons, maybe
earth not flat. continue live whole life thinking earth flat,
think, good father son daughter, like best
version happy yourself, think earth flat. So, like think
kind idea, just using kind silly, ridiculous example don't
like idea centralized forces controlling can can't see, also don't
like idea like not censoring anything. always biggest problem
that, central decider, think can decide want
see not, good companion reminds felt last time
this, felt good last time this. - Man, feel like every good story,
guide companion flies out, forges little bit further, little bit
differently brings back information helps us, least tries steer us
right direction. - So, yeah, exactly thinking working on.
mention bunch difficulties here, see little bit
recently. So, technically lot challenges here. Just like lot
technologies, reason talking podcast comfortably opposed
working secret, really hard maybe time not come.
something constantly struggle terms like entrepreneurially
startup, like also mentioned you, maybe offline, really don't care money,

01:16:57 Challenges Creativity

don't care business success, kinds things. So, difficult decision
make, much time want go give everything
this? big roll dice. also realized working
problems, robotics technical side terms machine-learning
system describing, lonely, really lonely. personal level
technical level. So, technical level, surrounded people kind


doubt me, think entrepreneurs go through. doubt following
sense, know difficult is. Like people colleagues mine,
know difficult life-long learning is, also know difficult build system
like this, build competitive social network. general, kind
loneliness just working something long periods time.
start doubt whether, given don't track record success, like
big one. look mirror, especially young, still
that, things, look mirror, like, big dreams,
know actually smart think are? Like know
going able accomplish dream? ambition. - sort don't,
kind pulling string hoping bigger ball yarn. - Yeah.
[Andrew laughing] kind intuition. think pride knowing
good at, reason intuition, 'cause think good
knowing things suck at, basically everything. So, like whenever
notice like, wait minute, kind good this, rare me. think like
that, might ball yarn worth pulling at. thing terms
engineering systems able interact humans, think good that.
talk podcasting on, don't know good
podcasts. - good podcasting, right? - certainly don't, think maybe
compelling people watch kindhearted idiot struggle form, maybe
compelling. terms like actual good engineer human-robot
interaction systems, think good. hard know it,
world keeps telling not, full doll, really hard.
struggling recently, kind fascinating struggle.
Goggins thing comes in, like, aside state-hard motherfucker, the, like
whenever struggling, good sign keep going, going
alone success, right? - Well, case, however, agree. actually David
post recently thought among many brilliant posts, one
brilliant talked myth light end tunnel.
instead, replaced myth with, concept eventually, eyes
adapt dark. tunnel, not light end, really
adapting dark tunnel. Goggins- - love much. - Yeah.
got share lot common knowing bit, share lot common.
loneliness pursuit dream, seems me, certain component


extremely valuable, loneliness serve driver
build companion journey. - Well, deeply aware that. So, like
people can make, 'cause talk love lot, really love everything world,
also love humans, friendship romantic, like even cheesy stuff, just- - like
romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, got much Rogan
like, Tango scene "Scent Woman,"

01:21:49 Suits & Dresses

find like nothing better woman red dress, just like classy- -
move Argentina friend. father's Argentine, know
said went podcast first time? said, dresses well.
Argentina, men go wedding party something, U.S., halfway
night, 10 minutes night, jackets off. - Yeah. - looks like
everyone's undressing party just got dressed for. said, know,
liked way dresses. started, talking you.
started podcast, said, don't wear real suit like friend Lex?

01:22:22 Loneliness

[laughing] - remember that. - No, can't. talk pursuit just bit
more, think talking about, building a, not just solution
loneliness, alluded loneliness itself, important thing. think
right. think within people, like caverns faults shame, also just
desire resonance, seen heard. don't even know seen
heard language. reservoirs loneliness, think, well,
interesting, maybe comment little bit it. just often
talk love, haven't quantified it, seems talk loneliness,
maybe just willing, share little bit that,
feels like now pursuit building robot-human relationship. been,
let direct, spending lot time building robot-human
relationship, at? - Oh, terms business, terms systems? - No,
talking specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, mention things.
So, one, startup idea hope millions people can use.


personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going
stairs, saw slip. big guy, wasn't 200 pounds,
90 pounds, bulldog, pretty big fit. noticed
wasn't carrying foot back like injured, no feeling all.
never liked touch hind paws, do, thing just flopping there.
vet found spinal degeneration told next one
go. suffer? Sure, hope not, something changed eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah,
eyes again, know spend long hours phone tell
like eyes convey mean internal states


sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking
Costello peeing. losing ability stand that, falling
that. think started realize. passage easy
peaceful, say this, not ashamed say it, mean, wake every morning
since just, don't even make conscious decision allow self cry, wake
crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief
moment. - Yeah. gone. - the, going gone lot people
too. - Well, struggling with. think maybe pretty good this.
Like, done before? [Andrew laughing] challenge. actually
part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

understand connect do, independent streams. One
hypothetical robot family member, form robot allow
people experience kind delight experienced many times,

01:11:33 Improving Social Media

like world able have, beautiful idea
give. social media social network platforms really serve
individuals best selves happiness growth. crossover
those, two parallel dreams? - 100% thing.
difficult kind explain without going details, maybe one easy way
explain way think social networks, create AI system yours.
not like Amazon Alexa centralized, data, like little friend
becomes representative Twitter helps find things will make feel
good, will also challenge thinking make grow, not get that, not let
get lost negative spiral dopamine, gets angry, just
get not open learning. so, little representative optimizing
long-term health. believe not good human beings, also good
business. think longterm, can make lot money challenging idea
way make money, maximizing engagement. one things
people disagree on, think Twitter's always going win. Like maximizing
engagement always going win, don't think so. think people woken now
understanding that, like don't always feel good, ones Twitter lot,
don't always feel good end week. - love feedback
whatever creature, whatever, don't know call it, maybe end
week, automatically unfollow people follow
realized really smart data feeling inside,
sleeping, something that, don't know, just wasn't good me. might also
put things people front see, kind sliver
look like? - whole point, interaction, sharing moments
learning lot you, now able understand interactions led
become better version yourself. Like person happy with.
isn't, flat earth feel good it, believe earth
flat, like idea sensor ridiculous. makes feel good


becoming best version yourself, think getting much flat
earth possible. Now, also good challenge ideas, not
centralized committee decided, tell system like
challenging ideas, think us do. then, actually YouTube doesn't
well, go flat-earth rabbit hole, going see.
nice get really powerful communicators argue flat earth. nice
see you, potentially, least long-term expand horizons, maybe
earth not flat. continue live whole life thinking earth flat,
think, good father son daughter, like best
version happy yourself, think earth flat. So, like think
kind idea, just using kind silly, ridiculous example don't
like idea centralized forces controlling can can't see, also don't
like idea like not censoring anything. always biggest problem
that, central decider, think can decide want
see not, good companion reminds felt last time
this, felt good last time this. - Man, feel like every good story,
guide companion flies out, forges little bit further, little bit
differently brings back information helps us, least tries steer us
right direction. - So, yeah, exactly thinking working on.
mention bunch difficulties here, see little bit
recently. So, technically lot challenges here. Just like lot
technologies, reason talking podcast comfortably opposed
working secret, really hard maybe time not come.
something constantly struggle terms like entrepreneurially
startup, like also mentioned you, maybe offline, really don't care money,

01:16:57 Challenges Creativity

don't care business success, kinds things. So, difficult decision
make, much time want go give everything
this? big roll dice. also realized working
problems, robotics technical side terms machine-learning
system describing, lonely, really lonely. personal level
technical level. So, technical level, surrounded people kind


doubt me, think entrepreneurs go through. doubt following
sense, know difficult is. Like people colleagues mine,
know difficult life-long learning is, also know difficult build system
like this, build competitive social network. general, kind
loneliness just working something long periods time.
start doubt whether, given don't track record success, like
big one. look mirror, especially young, still
that, things, look mirror, like, big dreams,
know actually smart think are? Like know
going able accomplish dream? ambition. - sort don't,
kind pulling string hoping bigger ball yarn. - Yeah.
[Andrew laughing] kind intuition. think pride knowing
good at, reason intuition, 'cause think good
knowing things suck at, basically everything. So, like whenever
notice like, wait minute, kind good this, rare me. think like
that, might ball yarn worth pulling at. thing terms
engineering systems able interact humans, think good that.
talk podcasting on, don't know good
podcasts. - good podcasting, right? - certainly don't, think maybe
compelling people watch kindhearted idiot struggle form, maybe
compelling. terms like actual good engineer human-robot
interaction systems, think good. hard know it,
world keeps telling not, full doll, really hard.
struggling recently, kind fascinating struggle.
Goggins thing comes in, like, aside state-hard motherfucker, the, like
whenever struggling, good sign keep going, going
alone success, right? - Well, case, however, agree. actually David
post recently thought among many brilliant posts, one
brilliant talked myth light end tunnel.
instead, replaced myth with, concept eventually, eyes
adapt dark. tunnel, not light end, really
adapting dark tunnel. Goggins- - love much. - Yeah.
got share lot common knowing bit, share lot common.
loneliness pursuit dream, seems me, certain component


extremely valuable, loneliness serve driver
build companion journey. - Well, deeply aware that. So, like
people can make, 'cause talk love lot, really love everything world,
also love humans, friendship romantic, like even cheesy stuff, just- - like
romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, got much Rogan
like, Tango scene "Scent Woman,"

01:21:49 Suits & Dresses

find like nothing better woman red dress, just like classy- -
move Argentina friend. father's Argentine, know
said went podcast first time? said, dresses well.
Argentina, men go wedding party something, U.S., halfway
night, 10 minutes night, jackets off. - Yeah. - looks like
everyone's undressing party just got dressed for. said, know,
liked way dresses. started, talking you.
started podcast, said, don't wear real suit like friend Lex?

01:22:22 Loneliness

[laughing] - remember that. - No, can't. talk pursuit just bit
more, think talking about, building a, not just solution
loneliness, alluded loneliness itself, important thing. think
right. think within people, like caverns faults shame, also just
desire resonance, seen heard. don't even know seen
heard language. reservoirs loneliness, think, well,
interesting, maybe comment little bit it. just often
talk love, haven't quantified it, seems talk loneliness,
maybe just willing, share little bit that,
feels like now pursuit building robot-human relationship. been,
let direct, spending lot time building robot-human
relationship, at? - Oh, terms business, terms systems? - No,
talking specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, mention things.
So, one, startup idea hope millions people can use.


personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief

part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

becoming best version yourself, think getting much flat
earth possible. Now, also good challenge ideas, not
centralized committee decided, tell system like
challenging ideas, think us do. then, actually YouTube doesn't
well, go flat-earth rabbit hole, going see.
nice get really powerful communicators argue flat earth. nice
see you, potentially, least long-term expand horizons, maybe
earth not flat. continue live whole life thinking earth flat,
think, good father son daughter, like best
version happy yourself, think earth flat. So, like think
kind idea, just using kind silly, ridiculous example don't
like idea centralized forces controlling can can't see, also don't
like idea like not censoring anything. always biggest problem
that, central decider, think can decide want
see not, good companion reminds felt last time
this, felt good last time this. - Man, feel like every good story,
guide companion flies out, forges little bit further, little bit
differently brings back information helps us, least tries steer us
right direction. - So, yeah, exactly thinking working on.
mention bunch difficulties here, see little bit
recently. So, technically lot challenges here. Just like lot
technologies, reason talking podcast comfortably opposed
working secret, really hard maybe time not come.
something constantly struggle terms like entrepreneurially
startup, like also mentioned you, maybe offline, really don't care money,

01:16:57 Challenges Creativity

don't care business success, kinds things. So, difficult decision
make, much time want go give everything
this? big roll dice. also realized working
problems, robotics technical side terms machine-learning
system describing, lonely, really lonely. personal level
technical level. So, technical level, surrounded people kind


doubt me, think entrepreneurs go through. doubt following
sense, know difficult is. Like people colleagues mine,
know difficult life-long learning is, also know difficult build system
like this, build competitive social network. general, kind
loneliness just working something long periods time.
start doubt whether, given don't track record success, like
big one. look mirror, especially young, still
that, things, look mirror, like, big dreams,
know actually smart think are? Like know
going able accomplish dream? ambition. - sort don't,
kind pulling string hoping bigger ball yarn. - Yeah.
[Andrew laughing] kind intuition. think pride knowing
good at, reason intuition, 'cause think good
knowing things suck at, basically everything. So, like whenever
notice like, wait minute, kind good this, rare me. think like
that, might ball yarn worth pulling at. thing terms
engineering systems able interact humans, think good that.
talk podcasting on, don't know good
podcasts. - good podcasting, right? - certainly don't, think maybe
compelling people watch kindhearted idiot struggle form, maybe
compelling. terms like actual good engineer human-robot
interaction systems, think good. hard know it,
world keeps telling not, full doll, really hard.
struggling recently, kind fascinating struggle.
Goggins thing comes in, like, aside state-hard motherfucker, the, like
whenever struggling, good sign keep going, going
alone success, right? - Well, case, however, agree. actually David
post recently thought among many brilliant posts, one
brilliant talked myth light end tunnel.
instead, replaced myth with, concept eventually, eyes
adapt dark. tunnel, not light end, really
adapting dark tunnel. Goggins- - love much. - Yeah.
got share lot common knowing bit, share lot common.
loneliness pursuit dream, seems me, certain component


extremely valuable, loneliness serve driver
build companion journey. - Well, deeply aware that. So, like
people can make, 'cause talk love lot, really love everything world,
also love humans, friendship romantic, like even cheesy stuff, just- - like
romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, got much Rogan
like, Tango scene "Scent Woman,"

01:21:49 Suits & Dresses

find like nothing better woman red dress, just like classy- -
move Argentina friend. father's Argentine, know
said went podcast first time? said, dresses well.
Argentina, men go wedding party something, U.S., halfway
night, 10 minutes night, jackets off. - Yeah. - looks like
everyone's undressing party just got dressed for. said, know,
liked way dresses. started, talking you.
started podcast, said, don't wear real suit like friend Lex?

01:22:22 Loneliness

[laughing] - remember that. - No, can't. talk pursuit just bit
more, think talking about, building a, not just solution
loneliness, alluded loneliness itself, important thing. think
right. think within people, like caverns faults shame, also just
desire resonance, seen heard. don't even know seen
heard language. reservoirs loneliness, think, well,
interesting, maybe comment little bit it. just often
talk love, haven't quantified it, seems talk loneliness,
maybe just willing, share little bit that,
feels like now pursuit building robot-human relationship. been,
let direct, spending lot time building robot-human
relationship, at? - Oh, terms business, terms systems? - No,
talking specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, mention things.
So, one, startup idea hope millions people can use.


personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot

me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud

that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

doubt me, think entrepreneurs go through. doubt following
sense, know difficult is. Like people colleagues mine,
know difficult life-long learning is, also know difficult build system
like this, build competitive social network. general, kind
loneliness just working something long periods time.
start doubt whether, given don't track record success, like
big one. look mirror, especially young, still
that, things, look mirror, like, big dreams,
know actually smart think are? Like know
going able accomplish dream? ambition. - sort don't,
kind pulling string hoping bigger ball yarn. - Yeah.
[Andrew laughing] kind intuition. think pride knowing
good at, reason intuition, 'cause think good
knowing things suck at, basically everything. So, like whenever
notice like, wait minute, kind good this, rare me. think like
that, might ball yarn worth pulling at. thing terms
engineering systems able interact humans, think good that.
talk podcasting on, don't know good
podcasts. - good podcasting, right? - certainly don't, think maybe
compelling people watch kindhearted idiot struggle form, maybe
compelling. terms like actual good engineer human-robot
interaction systems, think good. hard know it,
world keeps telling not, full doll, really hard.
struggling recently, kind fascinating struggle.
Goggins thing comes in, like, aside state-hard motherfucker, the, like
whenever struggling, good sign keep going, going
alone success, right? - Well, case, however, agree. actually David
post recently thought among many brilliant posts, one
brilliant talked myth light end tunnel.
instead, replaced myth with, concept eventually, eyes
adapt dark. tunnel, not light end, really
adapting dark tunnel. Goggins- - love much. - Yeah.
got share lot common knowing bit, share lot common.
loneliness pursuit dream, seems me, certain component


extremely valuable, loneliness serve driver
build companion journey. - Well, deeply aware that. So, like
people can make, 'cause talk love lot, really love everything world,
also love humans, friendship romantic, like even cheesy stuff, just- - like
romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, got much Rogan
like, Tango scene "Scent Woman,"

01:21:49 Suits & Dresses

find like nothing better woman red dress, just like classy- -
move Argentina friend. father's Argentine, know
said went podcast first time? said, dresses well.
Argentina, men go wedding party something, U.S., halfway
night, 10 minutes night, jackets off. - Yeah. - looks like
everyone's undressing party just got dressed for. said, know,
liked way dresses. started, talking you.
started podcast, said, don't wear real suit like friend Lex?

01:22:22 Loneliness

[laughing] - remember that. - No, can't. talk pursuit just bit
more, think talking about, building a, not just solution
loneliness, alluded loneliness itself, important thing. think
right. think within people, like caverns faults shame, also just
desire resonance, seen heard. don't even know seen
heard language. reservoirs loneliness, think, well,
interesting, maybe comment little bit it. just often
talk love, haven't quantified it, seems talk loneliness,
maybe just willing, share little bit that,
feels like now pursuit building robot-human relationship. been,
let direct, spending lot time building robot-human
relationship, at? - Oh, terms business, terms systems? - No,
talking specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, mention things.
So, one, startup idea hope millions people can use.


personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going
stairs, saw slip. big guy, wasn't 200 pounds,
90 pounds, bulldog, pretty big fit. noticed
wasn't carrying foot back like injured, no feeling all.
never liked touch hind paws, do, thing just flopping there.
vet found spinal degeneration told next one
go. suffer? Sure, hope not, something changed eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah,
eyes again, know spend long hours phone tell
like eyes convey mean internal states


sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking
Costello peeing. losing ability stand that, falling
that. think started realize. passage easy
peaceful, say this, not ashamed say it, mean, wake every morning
since just, don't even make conscious decision allow self cry, wake
crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief
moment. - Yeah. gone. - the, going gone lot people
too. - Well, struggling with. think maybe pretty good this.
Like, done before? [Andrew laughing] challenge. actually
part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

extremely valuable, loneliness serve driver
build companion journey. - Well, deeply aware that. So, like
people can make, 'cause talk love lot, really love everything world,
also love humans, friendship romantic, like even cheesy stuff, just- - like
romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, got much Rogan
like, Tango scene "Scent Woman,"

01:21:49 Suits & Dresses

find like nothing better woman red dress, just like classy- -
move Argentina friend. father's Argentine, know
said went podcast first time? said, dresses well.
Argentina, men go wedding party something, U.S., halfway
night, 10 minutes night, jackets off. - Yeah. - looks like
everyone's undressing party just got dressed for. said, know,
liked way dresses. started, talking you.
started podcast, said, don't wear real suit like friend Lex?

01:22:22 Loneliness

[laughing] - remember that. - No, can't. talk pursuit just bit
more, think talking about, building a, not just solution
loneliness, alluded loneliness itself, important thing. think
right. think within people, like caverns faults shame, also just
desire resonance, seen heard. don't even know seen
heard language. reservoirs loneliness, think, well,
interesting, maybe comment little bit it. just often
talk love, haven't quantified it, seems talk loneliness,
maybe just willing, share little bit that,
feels like now pursuit building robot-human relationship. been,
let direct, spending lot time building robot-human
relationship, at? - Oh, terms business, terms systems? - No,
talking specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, mention things.
So, one, startup idea hope millions people can use.


personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going
stairs, saw slip. big guy, wasn't 200 pounds,
90 pounds, bulldog, pretty big fit. noticed
wasn't carrying foot back like injured, no feeling all.
never liked touch hind paws, do, thing just flopping there.
vet found spinal degeneration told next one
go. suffer? Sure, hope not, something changed eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah,
eyes again, know spend long hours phone tell
like eyes convey mean internal states


sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking
Costello peeing. losing ability stand that, falling
that. think started realize. passage easy
peaceful, say this, not ashamed say it, mean, wake every morning
since just, don't even make conscious decision allow self cry, wake
crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief
moment. - Yeah. gone. - the, going gone lot people
too. - Well, struggling with. think maybe pretty good this.
Like, done before? [Andrew laughing] challenge. actually
part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations particular
robots. So, fascinated legged robots own, private sounds like
dark, like one experiments see can recreate magic. been,
lot really good already perception systems control systems able
communicate affection dog-like fashion. So, really good place there.
stumbling blocks, also part sadness recently, also
work robotics companies gave much heart, soul love
appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, Boston Dynamics also, company,
make lot money marketing teams. like looking
silly Russian kid suit tie, like, trying love
robot interaction dancing on? So, a, think say now,
like, break girlfriend something, right now, decided part
ways particular thing. huge supporters mine, huge fans,
particular thing, Boston Dynamics not focusing on, interested human-robot
interaction. fact, whole business currently, keep robot far away
humans possible industrial setting monitoring
dangerous environments. almost like remote security camera, essentially
application. me, thought still, even applications, exceptionally useful
robot able perceive humans, like see humans able to, big
map, localize humans human intention. example, like this,
lot work pedestrians, robot able anticipate
human doing, like walking. humans not ballistics object, just
walking way one moment, doesn't mean keep walking
direction, infer lot signals, especially head movement
eye movement. so, thought super interesting explore, didn't feel
that. So, working robotics companies much open
kind stuff, super excited fans mine. hopefully, Boston
Dynamics, first love, like getting back ex-girlfriend, will come around. so,
algorithmically, basically done there. rest, actually getting
companies work with. there's, people who'd worked robots know
one thing write software works, real machine
actually works. breaks kinds different ways fascinating.
so, big challenge there. almost, may sound little bit confusing
context previous discussion previous discussion


big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going
stairs, saw slip. big guy, wasn't 200 pounds,
90 pounds, bulldog, pretty big fit. noticed
wasn't carrying foot back like injured, no feeling all.
never liked touch hind paws, do, thing just flopping there.
vet found spinal degeneration told next one
go. suffer? Sure, hope not, something changed eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah,
eyes again, know spend long hours phone tell
like eyes convey mean internal states


sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking
Costello peeing. losing ability stand that, falling
that. think started realize. passage easy
peaceful, say this, not ashamed say it, mean, wake every morning
since just, don't even make conscious decision allow self cry, wake
crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief
moment. - Yeah. gone. - the, going gone lot people
too. - Well, struggling with. think maybe pretty good this.
Like, done before? [Andrew laughing] challenge. actually
part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

big dream, hoped millions people enjoy moment magic.
current discussion robot, something personally really enjoy, just brings
happiness, really try now everything just brings joy, maximize
'cause robots awesome. two, given like little bit growing platform, want
use opportunity educate people. Like robots cool. think cool,
hope able communicate cool others. So, little robot experiment
little bit research project too, couple publications MIT folks around
that. just make cool videos explain people
actually work. opposed people scared robots, still
scared, also excited, like see dark side, beautiful side, magic
means bring, machine become robot. want inspire people that.
less, interesting think big impact terms dream not
embodied AI. So, not need body. think
refrigerator's enough, AI system just voice hear you,
enough loneliness. embodiment just- - embodiment, mean physical
structure. - Physical instantiation intelligence. So, legged robot, even just
thing. humanoid robot, little humanoid robot maybe keep
table, like walks around, even just like mobile platform can just like,
turn around look you, like mentioned pen. Something moves
can look you, like Butter Robot asks, purpose?
really, almost like art. something physical entity moves around,
able look interact you, makes wonder means
human. like challenges think, thing looks like consciousness,
hell I? like feeling, think really useful us, humbling
us humans. less research, certainly less business
exploring selves, challenging others think like, think
makes human. - love desire share delight interaction robot.
describe it, actually find starting crave
elements childhood where,

01:30:09 Empathy

adulthood, experience something, want people feel that.
think right, think lot people scared AI, think lot people


scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going
stairs, saw slip. big guy, wasn't 200 pounds,
90 pounds, bulldog, pretty big fit. noticed
wasn't carrying foot back like injured, no feeling all.
never liked touch hind paws, do, thing just flopping there.
vet found spinal degeneration told next one
go. suffer? Sure, hope not, something changed eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah,

colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.

just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't

time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now

mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

scared robots. experience, robotic-like thing Roomba
Vacuum, goes about, actually, pretty good picking Costello's hair
shed grateful it. call something,
get caught wire something, find getting upset
Roomba moment, like, doing? obviously just
does. kind mostly positive, slightly negative interaction.
describing, much richness layers detail can
imagine relationships like. - Well, few, just quick comment.
So, had, currently Boston bunch Roombas iRobot.
experiment- - Wait, many Roombas? [Lex laughing] sounds like
fleet Roombas. - Yeah. So, probably seven eight, yeah. - Well, lot
Roombas. place clean. - Well, so, this, kind waiting, place
currently Austin, way larger need. basically got make sure
room robots. - So, seven Roombas, deploy seven
once? - Oh, no, different experience them, different experiments them.
So, one things want mention, a, think YouTube video
inspired try this, got scream pain moan pain whenever
kicked contacted. experiment see feel. meant
like YouTube video it, just seemed cruel. - Roomba
rights activists come you? - Like think released video, think going
make look insane, know people know already insane- - Now,
release video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, think maybe contextualize
showing robots like show fascinating, ultimately, felt like
human almost immediately. display pain that. -
Giving voice. - Giving voice, especially voice dislike, pain. -
connect friend Eddie Chang, studied speech language,
neurosurgeon, life-long friends. studied speech language,
describes primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans
delight, sounds well, use imagination, powerful rudders
other, emotions people. so, find fascinating, can't wait see
video. So, video available online? - No, haven't recorded it, just hit bunch
Roombas able scream pain Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like
people already- - Next podcast episode Lex, maybe one,
knows? - So, thing like people, noticed talk much love


really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going
stairs, saw slip. big guy, wasn't 200 pounds,
90 pounds, bulldog, pretty big fit. noticed
wasn't carrying foot back like injured, no feeling all.
never liked touch hind paws, do, thing just flopping there.
vet found spinal degeneration told next one
go. suffer? Sure, hope not, something changed eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah,
eyes again, know spend long hours phone tell
like eyes convey mean internal states


sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking
Costello peeing. losing ability stand that, falling
that. think started realize. passage easy
peaceful, say this, not ashamed say it, mean, wake every morning
since just, don't even make conscious decision allow self cry, wake
crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief
moment. - Yeah. gone. - the, going gone lot people
too. - Well, struggling with. think maybe pretty good this.
Like, done before? [Andrew laughing] challenge. actually
part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

really am, think want to, lot people, seems like got
dark person somewhere. thought release videos Roombas
screaming like, yep, yep, guy's definitely insane. - like
shouts glee delight, too, right? - Well, don't know to,
me, delight quiet, right? - Russian. Americans much louder
Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. like don't, unless talking like, don't
know sexual relationships Roomba. - Well, wasn't
necessarily saying sexual delight, but- - Trust me, tried. just kidding, joke,
internet. Okay [giggles] fascinated psychology little took. 'Cause
mentioned negative relationship Roomba. - Well, find
mostly, took granted. - Yeah. - just served me, collected Costello's hair.
something didn't like, get upset it. So, not
good relationship, taken granted get upset park
again, just like corner. - Yeah. - way frame
quite dumb almost cute. almost connecting dumbness. think
artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] interesting. - think flaws
feature, not bug. - So, along lines this, different sorts relationships
one robots, fear, also positive relationships

01:35:12 Power Dynamics Relationships

one have, much dimensionality, much explore.
power dynamics relationships interesting, obvious ones,
unsophisticated view this, one, master servant, right?
also manipulation, benevolent manipulation, children parents,
puppies this. Puppies turn head look cute maybe give little noise,
kids coup parents always think love parent,
many ways, studies show coups ways extract sorts
behaviors expressions parent want. child doesn't know
this, completely subconscious, benevolent manipulation. So, one
version fear robots hear lot think people can relate
robots take become masters become servants.
another version certain communities certainly not
part of, call topping bottom, robot actually manipulating


things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.

like eyes convey mean internal states


sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking
Costello peeing. losing ability stand that, falling
that. think started realize. passage easy

since just, don't even make conscious decision allow self cry, wake
crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief
moment. - Yeah. gone. - the, going gone lot people

Like, done before? [Andrew laughing] challenge. actually
part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

things, belief charge, actually
charge. so, think one explore second,
imagine wouldn't necessarily bad, although lead bad things.
reason want explore this, think people always default extreme, like
robots take little jail cells fun ruling
universe. sorts manipulation can robot potentially carry out, good bad? -
Yeah. Just so, lot good bad manipulation humans, right? Just
like said. [Lex sighing] [sighing] especially like said [giggles] topping
bottom, term? - think someone MIT told term. [Lex laughing]
wasn't Lex. - think. So, first all, power dynamics bed, power
dynamics relationships, power dynamics street, work
environment, different. think power dynamics can make human
relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating rich fulfilling
exciting kinds things. So, don't think bad,
goes robots. really love idea robot will top bottom
terms like power dynamics. think everybody aware that.
manipulation not much manipulation, dance like pulling away, push
pull, kinds things. terms control, think very, very, far
away AI systems able lock us up. lock us in, like much
control basically cannot live lives way want. think a,
terms dangers AI systems, much dangers
autonomous weapon systems kinds things. So, power dynamics
exercised struggle nations war kinds things.
terms personal relationships, think power dynamics beautiful thing. Now,
course, going kinds discussions consent rights
kinds things. - Well, here, talking about, always say discussion
around this, need define really context, always consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate,

01:39:11 Robot Rights

now talking human-robot interactions. so, guess that- - No,
actually trying make different point, believe robots will
rights line. think order us deep, meaningful relationships


robots, consider entities deserve
respect. really interesting concept think people starting talk
little bit more, difficult us understand entities
human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want
animals, USDA, Department Agriculture deal animal care
use committees research, farming ranching that. So,
first said it, thought, wait, would, there'll bill robotic rights, absolutely
makes sense context everything talking

01:40:20 Dogs: Homer & Costello

now. willing, love talk dogs, mentioned dogs
couple times, robot dog, biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah.
Newfoundland named Homer many years growing up. - Russia U.S.? -
United States. about, 200 pounds, big dog. -
big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, black dog really long hair
just kind soul. think perhaps true lot large, thought
small dog. So, moved like that, and- - dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So,
since fairly young? - Since very, beginning, till very, end.
one things, mean, kind a, mentioned like Roombas,
kind-hearted dumbness just overwhelming, part reason
named Homer, Homer Simpson, case people wondering
Homer referring to. [Andrew laughing] so, a. Yeah, exactly.
clumsiness just something immediately led deep love other.
one the, mean, always, shared moments, always
many nights together, powerful thing dog
loneliness, tough times, successes
kinds things. remember, mean, really moving moment me,
still miss day. - long ago die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So,
awhile. first time really experienced like feeling death. So,
happened, got cancer. so, dying slowly.
certain point couldn't get anymore. Now, lot things say
struggle with. Maybe suffered much longer needed to, something


really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going
stairs, saw slip. big guy, wasn't 200 pounds,
90 pounds, bulldog, pretty big fit. noticed
wasn't carrying foot back like injured, no feeling all.
never liked touch hind paws, do, thing just flopping there.
vet found spinal degeneration told next one
go. suffer? Sure, hope not, something changed eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah,
eyes again, know spend long hours phone tell
like eyes convey mean internal states


sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking
Costello peeing. losing ability stand that, falling
that. think started realize. passage easy
peaceful, say this, not ashamed say it, mean, wake every morning
since just, don't even make conscious decision allow self cry, wake
crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief
moment. - Yeah. gone. - the, going gone lot people
too. - Well, struggling with. think maybe pretty good this.
Like, done before? [Andrew laughing] challenge. actually
part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

human. mean, dogs animals can rights level
humans. - Well, yeah. can't whatever want

realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.

crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief
moment. - Yeah. gone. - the, going gone lot people

Like, done before? [Andrew laughing] challenge. actually
part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

really think lot. remember take hospital
nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, talking 200 pound dog
really power lifting time. remember tried figure kinds
ways to. So, order put sleep, take room. so,
carry everywhere. dying friend mine just to, first
all, really difficult carry, somebody heavy not helping
out. And, yeah. So, remember first time seeing friend laying
seeing life drain body. realization short time
made real, friend week before, day before,
now gone. was, don't know, spoke fact
deeply connected dog. Also spoke fact shared moments together
led deep friendship will make life amazing, also spoke fact
death motherfucker. So, know lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - can-
- saying this, definitely fighting back tears. thank sharing
that. guess cry over, don't want say dogs [laughing]
bound happen just given happening. Yeah, it's- - long
know Costello not well? - We'll, see, year ago start of,
six months pandemic, started getting abscesses not,
behavior change something really changed. put testosterone
helped lot things. certainly didn't cure everything, helped lot
things, dealing joint pain, sleep issues, just became slow
decline point two, three weeks ago, closet full medication.
mean, dog was, like pharmacy. amazing looked
day, still haven't cleaned removed things, 'cause can't quite
bring it, but- - think suffering? - Well, so, happened,
week ago, really just week ago, amazing. going
stairs, saw slip. big guy, wasn't 200 pounds,
90 pounds, bulldog, pretty big fit. noticed
wasn't carrying foot back like injured, no feeling all.
never liked touch hind paws, do, thing just flopping there.
vet found spinal degeneration told next one
go. suffer? Sure, hope not, something changed eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah,
eyes again, know spend long hours phone tell
like eyes convey mean internal states


sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking
Costello peeing. losing ability stand that, falling
that. think started realize. passage easy
peaceful, say this, not ashamed say it, mean, wake every morning
since just, don't even make conscious decision allow self cry, wake
crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief
moment. - Yeah. gone. - the, going gone lot people
too. - Well, struggling with. think maybe pretty good this.
Like, done before? [Andrew laughing] challenge. actually
part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

sake robots biology kinds, but- - think something
gone eyes? - think real, here, anthropomorphizing, think
realizing one great joys life, walk sniff pee things.
[Lex laughing] dog. - fundamental. - Loved pee things, amazing.
wondered put it, like reservoir urine, incredible. think,
oh, Eddie, put like one drop 50 millionth plant. get
50 millionth one plant, just have, leave puddle. talking
Costello peeing. losing ability stand that, falling
that. think started realize. passage easy
peaceful, say this, not ashamed say it, mean, wake every morning
since just, don't even make conscious decision allow self cry, wake
crying. unfortunately able make day, thanks great
support friends family, miss him, man. - miss him? -
Yeah, miss him. feel like, Homer, Costello, relationship one's dog
specific part. - So, part gone? - hard thing. think
different, made mistake, think. Moreover, hope good decision,
sometimes think made mistake brought Costello little bit world
podcast posting him, anthropomorphized public.
honest, no idea mental life was, relationship me. just
exploring first time 'cause first dog, raised since
seven weeks. - Yeah, got hold together, noticed episode released
Monday, mentioned Costello. Like brought back life brief
moment. - Yeah. gone. - the, going gone lot people
too. - Well, struggling with. think maybe pretty good this.
Like, done before? [Andrew laughing] challenge. actually
part me. know take care pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly,
pretty well. good support. worry little bit going land
people will feel. concerned internalization. something
still iterating on. - watch struggle, fascinating. - Right.
mostly shielding this, make happiest
people internalize Costello's best traits. best traits
incredibly tough. mean, a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, whole thing.
just born way. beautiful toughness never rolled
forward. just sweet kind was. people can take that,


win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football

possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed

win someplace, so. - think ways
probably live podcast too. should, mean, a, one things
loved role podcast brought much joy you.
mentioned robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? think powerful thing bring
joy into, like, allowing experience joy, bring joy others,
share others. really powerful. mean, not to, like Russian
thing, [chuckles] touched Lucy Kay moment keep thinking
show "Louie," like old man criticizing Louis whining
breaking girlfriend, saying like beautiful thing
love, made song catchy now now making feel horrible saying it,
like, loss. loss really also making realize much person,
dog meant you. like allowing feel loss not run away
loss really powerful. ways also sweet, just like love loss
also sweet know felt lot friend. I,
like continue bring joy. think amazing podcast. hope
[laughing] robots, whatever else source joy, right? maybe,
think one day getting another dog? - Yeah, time. hitting
key buttons here. want to, thinking ways kind immortalize Costello
way real, not just creating little logo something silly. Costello much
like David Goggins person, Goggins also grown kind verb.
going Goggins going to, adjective. Like extreme.
Like it, think me, Costello things. being,
being, noun, verb adjective. So, amazing super
power wish get, ability get everyone else things
without thing. [Lex laughing] Costello effect, call it. - idea
hope lives on. - Yes. Thank that. actually therapeutic
me, actually brings question, friends, not just co-scientists,
colleagues working project together world, somewhat similar.

01:52:41 Friendship

- Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. talk friendship, think
certainly know scientist elements lonely
scientific pursuit. elements many pursuits lonely. Music, Math


always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

always seem like like loneliest people. knows true not.
Also people work teams. sometimes people surrounded people interacting
people feel lonely. me, think well you, friendship
incredibly strong force making one feel like certain things possible worth
reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach them. So,
growing up, grew Russia age? - 13. - Okay. moved
directly Philadelphia? - Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - Philadelphia,
San Francisco Boston on. really Chicago, went high
school. - siblings? - Older brother. - people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] - Yeah, different person. somebody definitely look to.
wild man. extrovert, into, mean, also scientists, bio
engineer, he's, growing up, person did, drank
every drug. And, also life party. just thought the,
older brother, five years older, coolest person wanting
him. that, definitely big influence. think terms
friendship, growing up, one really close friend. came
another close friend, very, believe, don't know believe, draw lot
strength deep connections people, just small number people.
Just really small number people. moved country, really
surprised how, like, large groups friends, quote, unquote.
depth connection not sort perspective. Now, moved
suburb Chicago, Naperville. like middle class, maybe upper middle
class. like people cared material possessions deep human
connection. added thing. drove meaning almost anything
else friendship. Early best friend. name was, name Yura.
don't know say English. - say Russian? - Yura. last
name? remember was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. just
spent time together. also group friends. Like, dunno, like eight
guys. Russia growing up, like parents didn't care coming back certain
hour. spent day, night just playing soccer, usually called football, just
talking life kinds things, even young age. think people
Russia Soviet Union grew much quicker. [Lex chuckles] think education
system university level world-class United States terms like, really
creating really big, powerful minds. least used be, think aspire


that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

that. education system like, younger kids Soviet Union
incredible. Like not treat us kids. level literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.
- small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - like level
mathematics, made feel like shit not good mathematics. Like
we, think country, like, especially young kids 'cause cute.
Like babied. start really push adults later life. Like,
want best world this, get pushed. pushed
young age. Everybody pushed. brought best people. think
really forced people discover, like discover Goggin style, also
discover actually passionate about, not. - true boys
girls? pushed equally there? - Yeah. pushed. Yeah,
pushed equally, say. a, obviously more, not obviously,
least memories, a, right way put it? like
gender roles, not negative connotation. red dress versus suit
tie kind connotation, like, a, like guys like lifting heavy things girls
like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - traditional view gender,
1950, '60s. - didn't think terms of, least age, terms like roles
like homemaker something like not, people care
about. Like girls cared set things, guys cared set things.
think mathematics engineering something guys cared sort of,
least perception time. girls cared beauty. like guys want
create machines, girls want create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] now, course,
don't take forward kind philosophy life, just way grew
way remember it. all, everyone worked hard. value hard work
instilled everybody. that, think little bit hardship. course
also economically everybody poor, especially collapse Soviet Union.
poverty everywhere. didn't notice much, a,
not much material possessions, huge value placed human
connection. Just meeting neighbors, everybody knew other. lived
apartment building different United States days.
Everybody knew other. get together,

01:59:47 Russians & Suffering



drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, play guitar sing sad songs life. -
sad songs Russian thing? mean, Russians express joy time
time. - Yeah, do. - Certainly do. think about? 'cause
cold there? called places too, right? - think, just, first
Soviet Union, echoes World War II millions millions millions
people that, civilians slaughtered, also starvation there, right? like
echoes that, ideas, literature, art there. Like grandparents,
parents, there. contributes it, life can absurdly
unexplainably cruel. moment everything can change. there.
think empowering aspect finding beauty suffering everything
else beautiful too. like, just linger like, meditate death?
like, just think worst possible case find beauty that,
everything else beautiful too. write songs dark stuff.
somehow helps deal whatever comes. hopelessness Soviet
Union that, like, inflation, kinds things people sold dreams
never delivered. like, a, don't sing songs sad things,
going become cynical world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - don't want
give cynicism. Now, lot people did, one the, battle
cynicism. One things may common Russia kind cynicism about,
like, told thing said earlier dreaming robots, common
people dismiss dream, saying, no, not, wild. Like, else
know that? want start podcast? Like else? Like nobody's
making money podcasts. Like, want start podcast? kind
mindset think quite common, say entrepreneurship Russia
still not good. business, like, entrepreneur
dream big, others around you, like friends support group
make dream big. don't give cynicism appreciate beauty
unfairness life, absurd unfairness life, think just makes appreciative
everything. like a, prerequisite gratitude. so, yeah, think instilled
ability appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing.
also culture like romanticizing everything. Like, almost like romantic
relationships like soap opera, like like top dramatic. think
instilled too, not appreciate everything life, get like
emotional it. sense, like, get like visceral feeling joy everything.


friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

friends people opposite sex. Like, deep, like emotional
connection like [laughing] like way dramatic too. Like, guess
relative actual moment is. derive much deep, like dramatic joy
many things life. think attributed upbringing Russia.
thing sticks friendship. now since one
friend like United States, lives Chicago. name Matt. slowly
accumulating really fascinating people, selective that.
Funny enough, times, not lot times now interacting Joe
Rogan [chuckles] sounds surreal say, kindred spirit there. Like
connected him. people like also grappling sports
really connected with. actually struggled, glad
friend, struggled connect scientists. - can little bit wooden
sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even biologist. mean, one thing I, well, struck
fact work robots, engineer, AI, science technology,
sounds like hardware, right? describing know true
deep emotional life resonance really wonderful. actually
think one reasons many people, scientists otherwise
gravitated towards podcast hold elements.
Hermann Hesse's book, don't know you, "Narcissus Goldmund," right?
elements logical rational mind emotional mind
woven together. people haven't read it, should, embody full
picture. think much draws people you. - read every
Hermann Hesse book way. - usual [chuckles]

02:05:38 Public vs. Private Life

usual done 9% life is. No, true. mentioned Joe,
phenomenal human being, not just amazing accomplishments,
shows world one one. think heard say day interview,
said, no public private version him. like, me. said
beautiful. said, like fish got net. no
onstage offstage version. absolutely right. I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So,
but, well, guys, question actually about- - really good point
public private life. huge, just comment real quick. Like that,


a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

a, fan Joe long time, inspiration not
difference public private life. actually conversation Naval
this, said can't rich life, like exciting life
person publicly privately. think understand idea, don't agree it.
think really fulfilling exciting person privately publicly
exceptions. Now said, don't really strange sex kinks. like,
feel like can open basically everything. don't anything ashamed of.
things perceived poorly, like screaming Roombas,
not ashamed them. just present right context.
freedom person private public. Joe made realize
can that. also kind others. sounds kind absurd, really
always enjoyed like good others. Like just kind towards others.
always felt like world didn't want be. Like, much negativity
growing up, like just around people. actually just notice people talk, they,
like, complaining weather, just like big cities
visited. general negativity, positivity kind suppressed. not,
one, not seen intelligent, two, kind of, seen like
little bit weirdo. always felt like hide that. Joe made
realize, one, fully just person private public, two, can
embrace kind, just, way like, way know do. sort
like, Twitter like publicly, whenever say stuff, means saying stuff
simply almost point cliche. like, strength now say it, even
mocked. [Lex laughing] know mean? Like, just okay. everything's
going okay. Okay, people will think dumb. probably right.
point is, like, just enjoy yourself. Joe, almost anybody else,
successful it, inspired that. kind
person, private public. - love it. love idea authenticity doesn't
oversharing, right? doesn't mean reveal every detail life. way
true essence oneself. - Right. never feeling deeply
think introspect hiding something world
dishonest fundamental way. So, yeah, truly liberating. allows
think, allows like think freely, speak freely, just freely. said,
not like not still responsibility best version yourself. So,
careful way say something. So, whole point, not simple express


spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

spirit inside words. mean, people much better others.
struggle. Like oftentimes say something hear say it, sounds really
dumb not meant. responsibility have. not just like
person publicly privately means can just say whatever hell.
means still responsibility try be, express truly are.
hard. [Lex chuckles] - hard. think that, pressure, people,
say we, mean humans, maybe robots too, feel pressure able
express one moment one form. beautiful
somebody, instance, can capture essence love sadness anger
something song poem short quote, perhaps also possible
aggregate, things show up. instance, one things
initially drew want get know human scientist
eventually became friends, level respect brought podcast
listeners wearing suit. - Yeah. - serious here. raised thinking
overdress little bit, overdressed American, certainly American standards,
overdressed podcast, genuine. not reason,
except assume, assumed time,
respect audience, respect enough show certain way them.
also, them. - Yeah. - think
commitment friendship, just way talk friendships love
way hold higher ideals, think least consumer content
friend, find, aggregate, communicating are,
doesn't one quote something. think sort obsessed
like one Einstein quote, one line poetry something, think
embody way that, Joe well, live life
show collection things said done. - Yeah, that's, so,
aggregate goal, tricky thing, Jordan Peterson talks
attack way will ever be, but- - Right now? - now, right?
true now. people attack internet, one
problems Twitter, don't consider aggregate, take single
statements. so, one defense mechanisms, like Joe
inspiration, aggregate, good person, lot people will know that.
so, makes much immune attacks people bring
individual statement might misstatement kind, doesn't express


are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

are. so, that, like idea aggregate. power podcast,
hundreds hours there, people get know
are. do, post pictures screaming Roombas kick
them, will understand don't mean well. way, side comment,
don't know want release not just Roombas- -
whole dungeon robots. - Okay. So, problem, Boston Dynamics came
problem.

02:14:04 Treat Robot

But, let work like workshop you, maybe post
this, people will let know. So, legged robots, look like dog, trying
create real human-robot connection, like also incredible
can throw like off building land fine. beautiful. -
amazing. seen Instagram videos like cats jumping off like fifth story
buildings walking away. no one throw cat window
building. - Well, problem experiencing, certainly kicking robots,
really fascinating recover kicks. like just seeing
also seeing others it, just not look good, don't know that.
'Cause a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. don't, 'cause are- -
robot, no, kidding. interesting? - Yeah. - today's conversation,
probably it, thinking robots, bills rights things. Not
satisfy satisfy anything, except sentience aspect
being, load kick it. - don't think able kick it, might able
kick first time, not second, problem experience. One
cool things, one robots working with, can pick one leg
dangling, can throw kind way it'll land correctly. So, really- -
friend cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, look forward
letters cat- - Oh no, not suggesting anyone that, cat,
cat, just throw onto bed across room, run
back more, somehow nature relationship. think no one
animal, cat seemed return whatever reason. - robot
robot, fascinating hard that. So, unfortunate,
don't think can robot. Like struggle that. So, able


robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

robot, almost get like state imagine like doctors get
surgery, like robotics colleagues mine do,
like start seeing object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, just
fascinating robot. just want take little bit
tangent. - No, think important thing. mean, not shy fact
many years worked experimental animals, challenging
aspect biologist. Mostly mice, past no longer, thank goodness
'cause just don't like it, larger animals well. now work humans,
can give consent, verbal consent. So, think extremely important
understanding guidelines one's boundaries around
this. not just important question,

02:17:12 Value Friendship

might important question work can progress. - So, asked
friendship. know lot thoughts friendship,
think value friendship life? - Well, personally, just life
trajectory arc friendship, say, female friends
just friends, completely platonic relationships, mostly male friendship
me, been- - male friendships actually, yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - absolute lifeline. family, biological family
great respect love appreciation them, provided
the, won't even say confidence always anxiety taking good
risk, risk worth taking. given sense go certain things
try certain things take risk weather anxiety. don't consider
particularly competitive person, sooner die disappoint, let one
friends. can think nothing worse actually, disappointing one friends,
everything else secondary me. - disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not,
mean, certainly strive always show best can friendship, can
small ways. can mean making sure phone away, sometimes about,
terrible punctuality 'cause academic. so, just get lost time
don't mean anything, striving to, listen to, enjoy good times make
time. kind goes back first variable talked about, make sure spend
time get time person check in. think many ways


friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank

friendship vital me, actually me, makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well,
a, surprised like high school friends don't actually talk
often days terms time, every time see other, immediately
right back started. So, struggled much time really allocate,
friendship deeply meaningful always even
don't talk often. So, kind loyalty. think maybe different style,
think me, friendship hard times, think. Like much
reliable going shit like- - pretty reliable anyway. - No,
like wedding something like that, like, don't know, like want
award kind, yeah, congratulate shit you, like not,
there, not important like nobody else like
just shit hits fan, something's tough world turns
back you, kinds things, that, me, friendship meaningful.

02:20:33 Martial Arts

- Well, know true felt thing real thing you.
Let ask one thing actually, not practitioner Jujitsu,
know are, Joe is, years ago, read book really enjoyed, Sam
Sheridan's book, " Fighter's Heart," talks different forms martial
arts. maybe book, maybe interview, said
fighting, physical battle somebody, Jujitsu boxing form
direct physical contact two individuals creates bond unlike other.
said like one night stand, sharing bodily fluids somebody
barely know. - Yeah. - chuckled 'cause kind funny
kind tongue cheek. time, think fundamental way
members species bond physical contact. certainly,
forms, cuddling, hand holding, sexual intercourse,
sorts things. - cuddling? haven't heard it. - heard
recently, didn't know term, term, turned noun cupcake
verb, cupcaking turns out, just learned this. Cupcaking spend
time just cuddling. didn't know this. heard first, although heard first
just day. Cupcaking actually a- - Cuddling everything, not just like,
bed, coach? Like cuddling? look cuddling is- -


need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners

know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

need look need define variables. think definitely
physical contact, told, terms battle, competition, Sheridan
quote, just curious. So, get close, feel bond people that, instance,
rolled Jujitsu with, even though don't know anything else them,
right this? - Yeah, mean many levels. also book, what? "A
Fighter's Mind." - Yeah, third one. actually excellent writer.
interesting him, just briefly Sheridan, don't know him, little bit
research, went Harvard, art major Harvard, claims
smoke cigarettes art. don't know art good. think father
SEAL teams. got Harvard, graduated, took off
around world learning forms martial arts, early kind
ultimate fighting kind mixed martial arts things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. -
amazing. don't actually remember it, read it, remember thinking
amazing encapsulation makes fighting like art, like makes compelling.
say many ways Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports
general, like one intimate things do. don't know
describe terms bodily liquids kinds things. - think
less joking. - think ways that. So, one,
vulnerable [sighs] So, honesty stepping mat often us ego
thinking better particular art. honesty
submitted, worse thought just sitting knowledge,
kind honesty, don't get experience daily life. can continue
living somewhat illusion conceptions 'cause people not
going hit us reality, mat speaks truth, reality just hits you.
vulnerability like loss loved one, though loss
reality knew before, now deal new reality.
sitting vulnerability, people also sitting
vulnerability, get really connect like, fuck, like not special thought
was, life like not, life harsher thought was, just sitting
reality, us can put words them, can't. So, think
definitely, thing least intimacy. thing human contact.
something about, mean, like big hug, like COVID, people
hugged hugged them, always felt good did. Like
tested, especially now vaccinated, still people, true San


Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful

talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.

Francisco's, true Boston, want keep, not six feet away, stay
home never touch you. loss basic humanity opposite feel
Jujitsu, like contact like, don't give shit whatever
rules supposed society keep distance
kind stuff. Just hug, like intimacy hug, like good bear hug,
like just controlling another person, also kind love
communicated just trying break other's arms. don't exactly understand
violence close neighbor love, is. - Well, hypothalamus,
neurons control sexual behavior, also non-sexual contact, not just
nearby neurons control aggression fighting, salt pepper
neurons. interesting, almost sounds kind risky controversial
stuff, not anthropomorphizing means, brain,
structures interdigitated, can't separate except fine level.
here, way describe it, real thing. - want make
interesting comment. Again, things taken context,
one amazing things Jujitsu, guys girls train it.
surprised. So, like big fan yoga pants [giggles] gym kind thing. reveals
beauty female form. thing is, like girls dressed skintight clothes
Jujitsu often. found not all, thinking like training
girls. - Well, context non-sexual. - surprised learn that.
first started Jujitsu, thought, wouldn't kind weird train opposites
something intimate. - So, boys girls, men women, roll Jujitsu
together? - Completely. - Interesting. - times girls kind try stay away
guys, mean, two contexts, course, always going creeps
world. So, everyone knows kind stay away from,
size disparity. So, girls will often try roll people little bit closer weight-wise,
no, one things empowering women, fall love
started Jujitsu, first all, gain awareness pride
body, great. second, get [chuckles] especially later
on, start submitting big dudes like bros come shredded like
muscular, get technique exercise dominance them,
powerful feeling. - seen women force larger guy tap her, even choke
up. - Well, deadlifting like four, oh boy, think 495. So, really
power-lifting started Jujitsu, remember submitted by, thought


walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness

walked feeling like going be, not greatest fighter ever, least top three.
so, white belt, roll like happy. realize long
not applying much force, having, remember submitted
many times like 130, 120-pound girls Balance Studios Philadelphia, lot
incredible female Jujitsu players. really humbling technique can
overpower combat pure strength. thing, something
combat primal. Like there, just feels, feels like born this. Like
that- - circuits brain dedicated kind interaction.
no question. - felt like, wasn't learning new skill. like,
somehow remembering echoes something learned past. - Well,
like hitting puberty. child puberty no concept boys girls
attraction, regardless whether not attracted boys girl, doesn't matter.
point, people, not all, certainly, people, hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, certain people take romantic sexual
interest first time. - Yeah. - like, revealing circuitry
brain. not like learn innate. think it, hear way
describe Jujitsu enrolling Jujitsu, reminds little bit, Joe telling
recently first time went hunting felt like revealed circuit
along, hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. definitely there.
course, physical activity. One interesting things Jujitsu one
really strenuous exercises can late adult life, like
50, 60, 70s, 80s. came up, people 80s training.
long smart, long practice techniques pick partners
correctly, can kind art. late life. getting exercise.
not many activities find amenable that. So,
thinking game, Jujitsu particular art technique pays off lot. can
still maintain, first all, remain injury free use good technique, also
good technique able go, active people much, much younger.
was, me,

02:31:34 Body-Mind Interactions

running two activities can kind late life.
healthy life exercises piece puzzle. - No, absolutely. glad


physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

physical component, know you, talked
crossover physical intellectual mental.
still running ridiculous hours night ridiculously long? - Yeah, so,
definitely. running late night Austin. People tell, area
now, people say dangerous area, find laughable coming bigger
cities. No, run late night. something. - see guy running
Austin 2:00 a.m. suit tie, probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. mean,
think 'cause get recognized Austin. worry that, not
really, get recognized late night. something night
brings deep philosophical thoughts self-reflection, really enjoy.
recently started getting back grind. going competing hoping
compete September October. - Jujitsu? - Jujitsu, yeah. get back
competition. requires getting back great cardio shape.
getting, running part daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, always know
can reach regardless time zone middle night, wherever happens.
- Well, part just single programmer. two things
just don't work well terms steady sleep schedule.

02:33:22 Romantic Love

- not bankers hours kind work. Nine five. want to, mentioned single. want
ask little bit form relationship, romantic love. So,
parents still married? - Still married, still happily married. - impressive. - [Lex]
Yeah. - rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - grew example? -
Yeah. guess powerful thing, right? example think can work. -
Yeah. didn't family, see it, inspiring beautiful.
fact that, norm you, think really wonderful. -
Well, a, case parents interesting watch 'cause
obviously tension. Like, there'll times fought kinds things.
obviously get frustrated like, find mechanisms
communicate other, like make fun little bit, like
tease, get frustration out, ultimately reunite find
joyful moments energy. think clear 'cause got together
think early 20s, like very, young. think grow together people. - Yeah.


still critical period brain plasticity. [laughing] - also, mean, just like
divorce frowned upon stick out. think lot couples especially
time, Soviet Union, probably applies lot cultures. stick
put work, learn put work. do, start
get rewarding aspects being, like time sharing
many moments together. definitely something inspiration me,
maybe have. similar kind longing lifelong partner,
like kind view, friendship, lifelong friendship
meaningful kind. something time sharing time together.
Like till death us part powerful thing. Not force, not religion said
government said culture said it, want to. -
want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - many Roombas
have? - Oh, thought- - should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human
human children. - 'Cause already children. - Exactly. saying,
probably need least many human children Roombas. Big family, small
family. - So. - mind's eyes, bunch Fridman's running around. -
tell you, like realistically, can explain exactly thinking, similar
robotics work is, like purely logical right now, answer don't want kids.
just don't enough time. much going on. using
kind vision use robots know life will transformed first.
Like know love father. question many,
side hill. ridiculous number. just know that- -
feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source

Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.

feeling be, don't crystal ball, don't know. see upwards of,
certainly three come comes mind. - much partner
too. like that, open question, especially society
right partnership is. 'Cause deeply empathetic. want see, like me,
look relationship really excited passions
another person, like whatever into, doesn't career success.
kind success, just excited them, excited me. like
share excitement build, build build. also practical
aspects like, kind shit enjoy together? think family real
serious undertaking. - certainly is. mean, think friend said it, think
best, first have, successful relationship family.
said, first define role cast right person


role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, deep aspects that,
also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave
meaning, something made best version themselves, like made
productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can
imagine way felt Homer, way feel felt Costello
glimpse must like then. - Exactly. downside, thing worry
partner side that. seen, kids almost universally source
increased productivity joy happiness. Like, yeah, pain ass.
Yeah, complicated. Yeah, forth, people like complain kids.
actually look past little shallow layer complaint, kids great.
source pain lot people relationship doesn't work.
kind concerned like, dating difficult, complicated person.
difficult find right kind person. statement doesn't even
make sense not dating apps, don't see people. like first
person saw awhile. like Michael Malice like Joe. So, like, don't think
seen like female. it? element female species quite while. So,
think put there. it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will
find you, looking. element really taking leap
putting kind different situations. don't know
behind computer time. - Well, builder problem
solver, find solutions, confident solution there, and. - think
implying going build girlfriend, think. - Well, maybe
shouldn't separate friendship, notion friendship community, go
back concept aggregate, maybe meet woman friend,
maybe something sort. - So, one things, dunno feel
way, definitely one people just falls love it. - Yeah,
can't say like that. Costello instantaneous. - Yeah. - really was. mean,
know not romantic love, instantaneous. No, I, me. think
know, know, good thing there. - It's,


careful that, don't want fall love wrong person.
try kind careful with, noticed fall love every, like
mug, everything fall love things world. So, like, really
careful girl comes says loves DUSTY HUSKY, doesn't
necessarily mean marry tonight. - Yes. like way said loud
heard it, doesn't mean need marry tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly.
- [Andrew] Right. - mean, people amazing, people beautiful
that's, fully embraced that, also careful relationships.
time, like mentioned offline, don't, something
appreciates swinging fences not dating, like serial dating, dating
around. - Like one guy, one girl kind guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - said that. -
tricky want careful kind stuff. Especially now
growing platform ridiculous amount female interests certain
kind. looking deep connection, looking sending home alone,
every talking Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - podcast. -
Perfect solution. - going workout great. - well, part of,

02:42:51 Lex Fridman Podcast

constitutes machine learning sorts. - Yeah, sorts. - do, mentioned
now become quite extensive expansive public platform, incredible.
mean, number people out, first time saw podcast, noticed suit,
like, respects audience, great, also thought amazing.
People showing science engineering technology information
discussions sorts discussions. Now, want talk moment
podcast. two questions podcast are, started it,
plan? regardless answer is, know
taking it, like leave us? believe element surprise always
fun. podcast? enjoy podcast? mean, audience
certainly includes me, really enjoys podcast. incredible. - love talking
people, something microphones really bring best
people. Like don't get chance talk like this. just hanging out,
different conversation amount focus allocate
other. fun talking stuff things. There'll


lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

also aspect not smart enough side define role.
think part leap take. see kids
way. just go figure also. long love there,
like hell life even? I've, many incredibly successful people
know gotten know kids. presence kids
part something energizes them, something gave

productive, not less, fascinating me. - fascinating. mean, can

uniquely able do. Not completely uniquely, like, huge fan Joe
Rogan, ask myself, conversations can Joe Rogan can't?
me, know bring up, person thought time Putin.
Like bring up. just like Costello, not just person.
also idea strive for. Just dangerous conversations.
reason uniquely qualified Russian, also judo
martial arts, lot elements make conversation hasn't
before. people kept mind, like Don Knuth, computer
scientist Stanford thought one beautiful minds ever.
nobody really talked him, like really talked him. lectures, people
love, really just conversation him. people like that. One
passed away, John Conway, never got, agreed talk, died
did. people like that, thought like crime not hear
folks. unique ability know purchase microphone
Amazon plug device records audio publish it, seems
relatively unique. Like not easy scientific community. People knowing
plug microphone. - No. can build Faraday cages, two-photon microscopes
bioengineer, sorts things, idea take ideas export
structure pseudo structure people benefit seems like
cosmic achievement them. - don't know fear just basically haven't tried
it, haven't learned skill level. - think not trained. mean,
riff awhile, think that, important. maybe should,
it's, not trained it. trained think specific games
specific hypotheses, many don't care to, right? became scientists
felt safe, leave Haven safety? -
Well, also don't necessarily always see value it. together learning,
learning value this. think probably exceptionally
successful amazing podcast started just recently. - Thanks
encouragement. - Well, raw skill that's, definitely inspiration
podcast level excellence reach. think


discovered also impactful way science. podcast. think lot
scientists not yet discovered that. a, apply kind rigor
academic publication even conference presentations,
rigor effort podcast, whatever is, five-minute podcast,
two-hour podcasts, conversational, can like lecture like,
apply effort, potential reach time, tens thousands, hundreds
thousands, millions people. really, really powerful. yeah,
giving platform folks, especially personally, maybe can
speak fields drawn to, thought computer scientists especially
bad this. brilliant computer scientists thought amazing
explore mind, explore thinking. took almost an,
effort. time guests mind, people connect
interests. wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, American football
soccer. particular people really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev.
Saitiev brothers, even Khabib wrestling, just talk them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause
can, guys can communicate- - Russian wrestling, right? wrestlers
Russians. little, like opportunity explore mind able
bring world. also it, feel like makes better person, just
vulnerable exploring ideas together. don't know, like good conversation. don't
know often really good conversation friends, like podcasts like
that. deeply moving. - best. brought through. mean,
saw sit Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, folks
that, not just 'cause Nobel, comes mouth incredible.
able hold conversation much better, light years
beyond interviewer, don't want even call interviewer
'cause really conversation. Light years beyond anyone else
able engage beacon possible. know that, think
people drawn to. certain intimacy, certainly people,
friends, are, know other, that,
intimacy kinds private conversations made public. And. - Well,
the, you, probably starting realize, Costello, like, part it,
authentic putting completely, people
almost not just consuming words saying, also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle ideas try communicate ideas. like


flaws, like human being. - Oh, good, flaws. - Well, good 'cause got
plenty those. - like self-critical aspects, like careful,
self-critical flaws. mean, way, interesting
think people watch talk Penrose, not just Penrose
communicating ideas, like silly kid trying explore ideas. Like know
kid. human connection really powerful. Same, think Putin,
right? Like not just good interview Putin, also, kid struggling
talk one powerful, will argue dangerous people world.
love that. authenticity led that. return, get connect,
everybody run street kinds things, depth
connection there, almost within like minute two unlike other. - Yeah,
intimacy formed them. - Yeah, like
journey together. yeah, thing Joe Rogan ever met
him, right? Like was, fan Joe many years, something,
kind friendship absurd might say podcasting listening
podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe fills little bit solves little bit loneliness
talking earlier.

02:55:54 Hedgehog

- robots here. [laughing] - just couple questions, one
behalf audience, is, not going ask meaning
hedgehog, just want know, name? don't tell us
name, just, name? Yes no? - Well, name likes
referred as, private name privacy company
call other. No. [Lex laughing] not insane. No, name Hedgy.
hedgehog. don't like stuffed animals. story one minimalism. gave away
everything own, now three times life. everything mean almost everything,
kept jeans shirt laptop. recently also guitar, things like that.
survived always in, least first two times laptop
bag, just got lucky. just liked perseverance that. first saw
the, reason got stuffed animal, don't stuffed animals,
thrift store, like giant pile stuffed animals jumped me,
unlike rest them, intense mean look him.


just, upset life, cruelty life. just, especially contrast
stuffed animals, dumb smile face. look stuffed
animals, dumb look face. just happy. like
"Pleasantville." - say neuroscience, smooth cortex, not many
form. - Exactly. this, like Hedgy like saw it. like Dustyesky's
man underground. mean, sense saw darkness world
persevered. like, also famous Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog
Fog" grew with, connected with. [Lex laughing] People know
cartoon, see YouTube, it's. - "Hedgehog Fog." - Yeah. [Lex
laughing] just, expect, especially like early Soviet cartoons.
hedgehog, like sad, walking fog, exploring like loneliness sadness.
like, beautiful. like piece art, people should, even don't speak
Russian, see, understand. - Oh, moment said going ask,
Russian? course in- - Russian, more, little
speaking it. almost a, interesting exploration make sense
world see vaguely fog. trying understand
world. - Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny. crazy
animals, "Hedgehog Fog." - certain period,
again, don't know attributed to, really powerful,
period Soviet history, think probably '70s '80s like, especially kids
treated seriously. Like treated like able deal
weightiness life. reflected cartoons. was, allowed
like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons trying get like
smile run around, like create art. Like stuff that, know like short
cartoons short films can win Oscars, like swinging for. -
strikes little bit talking suit earlier, almost
like treat kids respect. - Yeah. - Like intelligence
honor intelligence. - Yeah, really just adult small body. Like want
protect true cruelty world. - Sure. - terms intellectual
capacity like philosophical capacity, right you.
cartoons reflected that, art consumed, education reflected that.
represents that. mean, sense of, survived long
don't like stuffed animals, like together
same, sharing moments together friendship. sense which,


world turns goes hell, least got other. doesn't
die, inanimate object, so. - animate him. - animate
him. probably want know thinking whole
time. probably really Taylor Swift something like that. like
wouldn't even want know anyway. - Well, now feel connection Hedgy,
hedgehog certainly didn't before. think encapsulates kind
possibility connection

03:01:17 Concluding Statements

possible human object robotics certainly.
saying heard graduate student just ringing mind
throughout conversation a, think appropriate way, that, Lex,
minority one, truly extraordinary ability encapsulate
many aspects science, engineering, public communication, many topics,
martial arts emotional depth bring it. just purposefulness,
think not clear people, absolutely stated. think
abundantly clear just amount time thinking put things is,
ultimate mark respect. So, just extraordinarily grateful friendship
conversation. - proud friend. just wished showed
kind respect wearing suit make father proud maybe next time.
[Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks much friend. - Thank you. Thank
you, Andrew. - Thank joining discussion Dr. Lex Fridman.

lot distraction. phone use kind stuff.
100% focused focus idea. like sometimes playing
ideas don't know answer to, like question don't know
answer to. like fumbling it, trying figure out, trying get insights
something haven't really figured together arriving that. think
magical. don't know need microphones that, somehow do. -
feels like science. - feels like science me, definitely. exactly it.
really glad said don't actually often say this, exactly
felt like. wanted talk friends colleagues MIT real science
together. felt it. Like really talk problems actually
interesting, opposed like incremental work currently working
particular conference. really asking questions like, doing? Like,
headed to? Like, big, really going help us solve, case
AI, solve intelligence? Like, even working intelligence? certain sense,
initially called artificial intelligence. like us not working
artificial intelligence. working specific problem set
techniques, time machine learning solve particular problem. not
going take us system anywhere close generalizability human
mind. Like kind stuff human mind can terms memory, terms
cognition, terms reasoning, common sense reasoning. doesn't seem take us
there. initial impulse was, can talk folks science together
conversation? also thought not enough, didn't think
enough good conversations world-class minds got meet. not ones
book, like just thing. Oftentimes go tour
book, lot minds don't write books. - books constrain
conversation too, talking thing, book. - there's,
noticed that, people haven't written book brilliant, get talk
ideas new way. haven't actually, raise question, don't know
answer question raised. try arrive there. Like, dunno,
remember asking questions world-class researchers deep learning of,
neural networks work well do? question often loosely asked, like
microphones think it, 30 minutes
hour think together, think science. think really powerful.
one goal. one is, again, don't usually talk this,


sense wanted dangerous conversations. Part
reasons wanted wear suit like, want fearless. reason don't usually
talk feel like not good conversation. looks like doesn't
match current skill level. wanted really dangerous conversations
