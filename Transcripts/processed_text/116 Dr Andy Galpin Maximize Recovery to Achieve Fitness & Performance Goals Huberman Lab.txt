Top Contour stuff way fine details. question recovery
it’s one think people familiar themselves, soreness, think
muscle soreness. trained early scientific career always
question seemingly obvious, couple questions soreness. First all,
soreness really reflect? really muscle soreness? feels like it’s muscles,
organ systems tissues cell types involve, particularly
interested concept, experience many us, including myself,
delayed, onset muscle soreness? less shape
perform movement extremely novel us, soreness seems arrive
reasonable delay maybe even day. know fine next day, 48 hours
later exceedingly sore get fit familiar movement,
soreness seems arrive earlier. realized, just asked three questions
more. First all, muscle soreness seller level sells organ systems
forth? mean sore something know get little bit later
delayed onset muscle soreness? It’s actually one question, it’s totally
fine! answered all. asked three, going actually answer number
three, will answer number two, will actually answer number one love tell
set way intentionally uh. just happy hear
unable concise, able concise. Thank you. still learning lot
area. It’s actually really difficult perform studies anytime. ask question
something like pain soreness. You’re immediately talking perception -
obviously physical component also perception teasing
things extraordinarily challenging. said, lot work
area. fact probably um. may show already pain maybe one's coming
road. episode pain uh ago, it’s definitely time revisit
literature. also amazing colleagues Stanford work pain
uh cellular molecular side, also psychological side
understanding pain believe pain, shapes experience pain
Pain Relief. Amazing, that’s stuff incredibly important glad flagged that,
maybe just call good now come back later another one
shows. said, happen? Uh 28 48 hours exercise?
Well, actually give Clues happening, traditional
dogma delayed onset muscle soreness, called result quote
unquote, micro, tears muscle, can sort think. challenge muscle:
small tears feeling results that. Well, fact,
certainly happen can happen. not explaining muscle,


soreness fact can quite sore exercise no measurable amount
muscle damage much like anything else. idea pain, it’s not
one-to-one explanation. multiple factors probably causing perception
pain. Muscle damage can one them. not one, probably
opinion, though yet shown definitively, probably not even leading cause
it, actually happening. Well, reason is, taking 24 48 hours can
actually find various papers, literature reviews dating back number years now
decade show wonderful curves inflammatory immune response,
don't need necessarily go entire physiology right now effectively
happening things little bit time delay, steps
happen immediately like right. exercise
delayed six 24 48 hours. know little bit physiology, it’s
combination neutrophils macrophages bunch things happening,
Time sequence. happens time get 28 48 hour window now
muscle soreness kicks wait minute I, result muscles
torn, happened immediately, wouldn't pain start immediately well, Answer
would, first clue that’s not responsible it. look
immune response - see actually Peak 24 48 hours later
that’s time, pain kicked in. That’s cooling problem,
immune response happening inflammation. Then, sudden start getting fluid
accumulation now called nociceptors you're, probably
obviously, familiar these, pain receptors. What’s actually
interesting, don't necessarily know lot information many pain receptors
muscle they're, not really belly? fact, can perform muscle
biopsies don't really hurt. mean belly muscle, correct yeah.
pressure sensors, though, so, change volume tissue, will
respond quickly, enhancing swelling actual muscle.
immediately putting pressure pressure receptors. will that’s signal,
probably happening here, just just hate give another bone. lot
delayed muscle. Soreness probably just neural feedback loop, rather
actual muscle damage yeah. makes lot sense lot interactions
types neurons control touch, sensation pain, sensation itch sensation. fact,
lot people um kind collapse itch pain together, Bingo yeah, know, that’s
something, it’s painful itches familiar thing people mosquito bites um
and, course, classic gait theory pain yeah, uh People will familiar
explain explaining um, something hurts


know Bonk knee stub toe. tend grab body part try
rub totally, rubbing not coincidental thing. activates set uh touch:
sensors are, respond kind broad dull touch um actively inhibits
release inhibitory neurotransmitter, fibers control pain signal.
anytime rub know like charlie horse, leg stub toe, we,
know wince, grab tone got like squeezing little bit. That’s
actually deactivating partially inactivating pain mechanism. idea uh
swelling response trigger neural response then, recruit pain,
receptor response here, using broad, broad, brush um Strokes explain um
makes good sense

00:11:35 Muscle Spindles, Reduce Soreness

Um now, now explained process works, can actually even
add that. remember muscles work, sort
signal nervous system actually go tell muscle contract. Well
remember: episodes ago. covered physiology called
motor unit, okay. Well, didn't explain called muscle spindles
talked proprioception episode well, never tied picture
together. let walk really quickly it’s going tie Loop
nice bow. happens um? motor unit coming called
alpha motor unit that’s going innervating muscle, fibers, that’s going tell
muscle fibers contract. typically spread throughout uh. sides
muscle interior, exterior outside, though another type muscle,
called muscle spindle. Now non-contractiles, don't actin
myosin don't produce Force. responsive, proprioceptive.
means sense stretch, why, example, stretch
hamstring stretch muscle group, doesn't really matter muscle. innate
response fire back close distance, keeps say
leaning right, can imagine example give is, you're, standing
one foot, start swaying right. right, say standing right
foot, makes easier folks start swaying right like you're, going
fall right ear will hit ground. inside right, calf muscle will start
stretched. outside will start compressed right, stretch inside
right calf muscle will sense stretch will respond Contracting pulls back


middle stops falling. That’s proprioception muscle spindles sense
stretch tell contract way work gamma motor neurons,
sensory things. happening unlike tell muscle
contract. goes Alpha muscle contract. muscle spindles work oh
stretched, sends signal back Central Point, typically spinal cord,
don't actually want go way up. brain got time delay.
subconscious autonomic right versus somatic, gamma going go back
central location come back Alpha motor neurons
contract. wonderful mechanism sensing stretch going back. Well, one
Theory that’s put forward regarding muscle damage pressure actually
applied nerve endings muscle spindles, that’s actually responsible
pain signal. That’s going back coming brain registering
pain. Rather actually contractile units, muscle fibers that’s
intriguing idea, uh, suggest stretching muscles order alleviate
soreness might exact incorrect thing do. Yeah. Now, not saying that’s sure
certain just building off mechanistic logic laid here, yeah, really
laid here, effective principle based exactly that, is.
generally low level movement effective reducing acute soreness, that’s
low-level contraction muscles going anti-stretch get tissue
get fluid out. Wow you're, literally pumping cell. Yes previous
episode, talking programming, using Wii, fair
educating us, including me, um audience different structures
programming, exercise, specific adaptations Etc month week, year, scales, Etc.
brief um discussion fact one trains legs hard resistance
training, know heavy squatting dead, lifting yeah or,
soreness oftentimes quote-unquote lighter cardio um. uh low
impact work. next day number different things involve um, not high
intensity contractions muscles, require contractions muscles
can alleviate soreness quickly one Simply lie around. know.
Watch Netflix something yeah, that’s exactly right, um go back just little bit well
that’s really case um. question like: inflammatory signal coming
much learned there, little bit information right now
suggests it’s potentially coming free radicals released mitochondria
may may not hold research comes, not sure, remember
back uh conversation endurance, talked electron transport chain
aerobic metabolism regardless whether not getting energy


glycolysis carbohydrates, remember, finished aerobic
Metabolism, even lifting weights using carbs fuel,
got finish metabolism running mitochondria Performing oxidative
metabolism. result electron transport chain runs. So, theoretically, free
radicals, hyper-reactive oxygen species, basically oxygen
molecules missing electrons, react lot things,
opposite antioxidants. way, oxygen molecules extra protons,
can balance charge leak going massive,
inflammatory signal that’s probably signals cause neutrophils
macrophages kicks off entire Cascade again, believe need research
there. need look it. Maybe it’s definitive know, that’s probably
happening potentially happening rather causes Cascade Signal. Also,
combination of. Well, that’s case, not getting
tremendous amount muscle damage aerobic based exercise? Well,
don't mechanical tension pulling fibers, that’s actually causing
damage cell wall allows free radicals escape mitochondria
cell wall. that’s best. can postulate moment things
happening low level exercise tends enhance even things like
percussion, using either instruments put low level vibration leg like
pneumatic boots. can massage things generally probably helping
moving stuff demon specifically pressure comes off
nerve, endings muscle spindles, allows stop receiving signal
pain. Despite fact didn't actually regenerate tissue yet fascinating,
think beautifully frames headed next, talk different
modes recovery accelerate perhaps even combine different
forms recovery order become better recovering make faster
progress Fitness

00:18:56 Exercise, Homeostasis & Hormesis; Blood Test & Fitness Level

kick off discussion recovery understanding recovery
specific adaptations exercise actually occur. love share us
happens needs happen recovery order us get better anything,
endurance, strength, Etc, also specific types exercise, stimuli specific types
adaptations trigger running bit further. Lifting bit weight, slowing


Cadence given movement, Etc. specific types triggers adaptation relate
specific maybe similar types recovery required us make progress
one previous episodes. talking Harvard fatigue lab really
identified idea homeostasis least sort championed that’s important
levels physiology wants return homeostasis. happens terms
adaptation? challenged level realizes? not make change,
will not able get back level homeostasis. That’s fundamentally
happening. recovery, process taking insult temporarily reduced
functionality, causing change now come back get often call
support performance super compensation. really doing, though, bringing
new level homeostasis effectively. understanding insult comes again.
need able make sure doesn't cause level disruption,
raise bar whether enhancing ability take level mechanical
tension muscle not result micro damage. Whether able take
reduction energy not compromise sleep anything, it’s really
fundamentally changing. can new level homeostasis, it’s
presuming it’s predicting insult going come road.
wanted clarify people Dr Galvin says insult may actually insult me,
um insult nerd speak terminology sort damage inflicted tissue
system. um speaking insult muscle insult neuromuscular
connection, created adding weight bar running distance um running
bit fast pedaling faster. creates micro insult insult. now,
everyone familiar um, psychological verbal insults, never forget
biological concept, it’s important. tag another thing here, called hormesis. It’s
one favorite phenomenon, effectively means dosage
toxicity, responds almost everything. think context say
drugs, means is, gave 10 milligrams something okay,
give 20 it'd problem eventually, go give enough, thing
turns toxic: case everything cyanide, can actually small
dosages nature. fact, it’s many fruits eat, it’s not dosage,
doesn't matter dosage gets higher, though actually can cause problems,
high enough, can actually kill instantaneously. back end that, though,
introduce micro insult framed perfectly, body will
adapt it, that’s really happening exercise adaptation is, hormetic
stressor that’s important is, look immediate responses exercise
see extremely large increase inflammation, see, oxidative stress, see whole


Cascade autophagy, like problems quote unquote happening. It’s actually
quite funny. is, part PhD, academic portion. go
medical side school, physiology class med school,
non-medical doctor class right, PhD. leave lab. walk across
campus take physiology class folks died whole time internally,
every time cover new area, basically exact value
number medical setting like. Oh, gosh they're, going die performance
setting like person's fantastic shape. I've? Never still amuses day,
obviously, it’s just simple things like total blood volume right cover like
okay, patient come blood volume six liters, know can
immediately get diuretic sort going heart attack
blood pressure gets right now, immediately thinking damn six leaders
person super fit actually positive adaptation training it’s one
important, not important Adaptation endurance training enhance, total
blood volume, store blood body fit less
fit. mean go things. Sodium concentrations - potassium
concentrations like look things paper don't know person
die 65 years old shape person going break
world record marathon. brings important tangent, uh,
instance, go take blood test - somebody exercises
intensely uh resistance training, blood creatinine levels can way range,
physician doesn't know certain forms exercise might say:
wow, lot muscle tissue damage occurring body yeah, mentioned
before, total blood volume is, dangerously High, fact, far healthier
need much fitter person who, numbers range, said,
obviously um limits statements, whereby want
cautious take action ameliorate, elevated blood, creatinine level something
sort. point bringing also one field medicine,
many, not all, many Physicians don't take consideration uh outside
activities people doing, becomes kind plug-and-play type, um type
Way looking blood charts, yeah done many thousand athletes, blood chemistry
uh. don't use. First all, never look disease stuff, that’s not do.
take people healthy try optimize performance blood. Chemistry one
best tools. really understand there, can get
incredibly powerful information blood chemistry actually relates
going talk today terms measuring everything acute Chronic dehydration


sleep, deprivation can identified blood Chemistry optimization improvements
nutrition, supplementation lot can get there. people interested field,
Point gentleman named Dan Garner. just absolute Juggernaut
wizard blood chemistry high performance, well can get ton information
that. understand difference exactly talked about. Looking
signals increased risk cardiovascular events, 25 years road versus, this:
optimal value high performance athlete, database
software stuff does, looking things. going talk
biomarkers look little

00:30:20 Recovery Timescales, Adaptation & Optimization

Bit later salivary blood stuff, maybe save part conversation
road. Tell different time scales recovery. Sure actually
trying answer question got way off track, reason
brought Hermetic thing is: understand things acute say, 24
40 hour period, look terrible. It’s actually fine right, stimuli, that’s causing
adaptation. reason brought medical exchange you,
looked inflammatory markers mentioned them, see
highest acute within seconds minutes hours exercise. However, that’s
exactly stimuli needed bring chronically, okay chronically meaning.
Maybe moment elevated maybe coming 24 hours later
48 hours. However, compare resting level say Monday,
worked resting level, Monday week following week following that,
probably see Baseline inflammation goes down, got
really careful. talking immediately post-exercise man, markers look terrible?
Maybe recovery score awful, Etc. That’s not necessarily bad thing,
like looking not change happening today, trying
cause adaptation may take us weeks months actually access. love
highlighting principle, one obvious ones now said
heart rate. Absolutely. heart rate goes very, high exercise,
fairly consistently even semi-consistently. resting heart rate will actually quite bit
lower. That’s fantastic example! Really getting concept,
think it’s important differentiate adaptation optimization. Now hear
word use scientists hate it, it’s good communication tool, optimization


optimizing current moment, almost surely compromising late
adaptation right. If, say, thing right now makes feel absolute
best world like great, took nap donut like awesome,
feel amazing, know it’s causing long-term issues. can said
back end, never choosing things make better right now, never
actually going see adaptation. really recovery
conversation playing game balancing immediate gratification leg
gratification, identify much now versus not? use value
marker? Whether tired feel today, sore today versus score
app tracking metric, blood marker, anything understand. that’s
need cause adaptation, want week month, three months now
case athletes, it’s even four years right, trying cause
adaptations will get us want get Olympics World Championships
World Cup, wherever going that’s framework, think
recovery. maybe falsely think need maximize recovery today
something like taken anti-inflammatory, whether supplementation
drug, maybe ice. Oh cool, that’s great! will enhance recovery
moment. That'Ll make feel better today, probably tomorrow, know
blocks signal adaptation, not going get results. know four
six, eight weeks now. talk recovery, understand tool
am. using order that, understand training
trying maximize middle season athlete
competing tomorrow, going head towards Acute recovery right
actuate performance right now, starting off season, not hedging towards
recovery, actually hedging towards adaptation, not going deploy these,
especially things like evidence combination vitamin C vitamin E will
blunt hypertrophic adaptations anti-inflammatory antioxidants right
Studies shown? Maybe don't uh inhibitory fact may may not
point conceptually. want careful trying optimize for,
forethought alone going dictate decision making
whether not get eyes uh now will cover tools, Like
massage pretty fine use, don't worry blocking

00:35:10 Adaptation & Biomarkers Levels



Long-Term adaptation, others going want careful
principle laid us, set events occur
exercise trigger adaptation sets motion number adaptations
occur recovery give us exact opposite response trigger
go back heart rate example: um heart rate close maximal maximal.
enough times within short know week two weeks resting
heart rate goes down. recall episodes ago, said maximum heart rate
doesn't really change. much. correct? Yes, okay, resting heart rate can
go quite bit yep. general theme meaning less set
upper limit ceiling things like inflammatory markers heart rate, maybe even things
like stress deliberately trigger stress dramatic increase
heart rate dramatic Increase inflammatory markers lowering floor,
ceiling Remains Same. It’s dependent upon marker, case
maximum heart rate, will not change exception one thing age, brings
down. Training will not change circumstances. look something like
inflammatory response, suppose, theoretically, ceiling, though not aware
um. can tell right now, looking blood markers, things like creatine kinase,
remember conversation metabolism use phosphocreatine
one primary fuel sources explosive exercise. Well, using phosphocreatine
creatine kinase, remember, kinase enzymes function break things
part, creatine kinase enzyme use break creatine
that. lot, creatine kinase gets muscle seeps blood
myoglobin actually another fantastic marker. way, myoglobin is, think
hemoglobin blood, molecule carries oxygen around it’s
muscle tissue. it’s myoglobin mild, meaning muscle it’s globulin thing.
bunch markers can look muscle breakdown one things
can see creatine kinase level. That’s elevated say, um, one bout exercise and,
might, might up. know five six-fold. actually seen number
offensive lineman NFL, something like 500 plus fold, even within just one
category next. number can get extraordinarily high know actually
one important Point here, paying attention mechanistic research
use you're, using inform decision making, extraordinarily careful
magnitude Mean is, running western blot looking
signaling protein um muscle uh activation protein turn mitochondrial
biogenesis, saw whatever intervention gave it, whether nutrition thing
drug exercise - saw signaling protein increased 20 percent.


basically assume totally physiologically irrelevant, order
important, totally depends market looking at, markers
might need see four five six hundred fold increase before. know will actually
enough call physiologically relevant others one two percent
relevant, really want careful either reading papers
looking Social Media stuff. people just talking this, marker increase much,
may not matter, may totally irrelevant physiologically,
also, wondering like hell are, people. Well, that’s can
trick little bit intentionally not. just trying best,
don't really understand area enough, that’s important point pay attention to.
So. answer question fully, hard determine truly
maximum level um. things don't want move like blood pH. doesn't really want
move range going move from, know like 6.8 7.4, get
like 7.9, like you're, probably big big big trouble, things can go 500 5 000
fold, markers will really determine answer well point future.
love continue discussion around topic stress, specifically yeah um,
maybe will get little bit later today um get use deliberate
cold exposure, that’s certainly um effects related directly temperature
tissue. certainly mental effects terms raising one's level perceived pain. It’s
fun um, people love people love feeling get it.
Um deliberate cold exposure. people like feeling get not
unlike exercise totally. love train. love exercise, know many people uh um.
loathe exercise, love feeling afterward. will theme will
come back to. Thank indulging interest

00:40:36 4 Recovery Levels, Enhance Recovery

semi-tangent, think it’s relevant tangent thing, can now return
us different time, scales, yeah modes recovery, think
headed get better recovery. Yep. talk tools, talk
measure identify four distinct levels, level one call
overload just quickly means is. workout today. sign
symptom overload fatigued. Acute performance down, worked hard right
now. go, try maximum effort, reduced ability.
recovery period acute overload minutes days right. That’s generally, call


acute overload that’s looking right. systems theoretically
see hormetic stressor come back response, come back, bigger, better, efficient,
Etc. continue training state, like us, say workout
today, little bit acute overload going work tomorrow. little acute
overload can work next day little acute overload. Even took day
it’s doesn't matter right, just continue acute bouts insult
going pushing absolute golden Target, call functional
overreaching. reached can currently results
functional outcome, mean functionally performance enhanced
performance whatever deem stronger, you've, enhanced
muscle size, mitochondria improved you've, whatever thing is, it’s not just
physical performance thing right, amazing, recovery time functional overreaching
typically days maybe even week so, typically, see happen
prior competition. Individuals will call taper, reduced training
volume short period time, reason do. again.
Actualize phrase year adaptations, worked hard six
weeks know, theoretically, workouts. three four five six weeks ago,
allow, system recover will actualized, means performance will
enhanced. functional overreaching golden Target. Okay,
point functional overreaching - continue train intensified whether
intensity volume really. said earlier, something
holding back recovery. doesn't really matter right. It’s it’s sort two sides
coin. move call non-functional overreaching
reached again, now non-functional not see positive benefit
recovery allowed. typically means weeks takes weeks come back from,
basically just get back Baseline, lot folks end
vicious cycle, like man, not getting results. want. going train
harder, not getting results. want going train harder harder,
caught recovery isn't improved, just end spot. train
end spot end up. just either blowing quitting
not getting want. continue past point, may
actually actually call training typically, considered
trained takes months recover people think trained really
not you're. Just probably non-functionally overreached classic distinction is,
took three four days off felt better, weren't, probably quote unquote
trained. probably just area non-functional reaching. need little bit


back off - case. happen gymnasts
cheerleader things take month off barely seeing
start come back Baseline numbers. number areas, mood desire
train testosterone, cortisol ratios biomarkers number areas - physical performance,
vertical jump height, like things just start get back Baseline, true
training actually quite rare. Non-Functional overreaching much common
shorter time frame scale. talk recovery, four pieces
really thinking about, so, concerned about, oh super sore.
get less sore? either not sore next time? workout
super sorry. Now. recover playing first category overload
can certainly talk figure out. quick answer got go back
previous episodes just pay attention volume intensity recommendations
getting significantly uh damage fatigue workout? probably
increased volume quickly, something else dragging stress bucket down,
generally, problem training. Um either didn't warm sufficiently.
fueling strategy off talk Next Episode violated. One
principles increasing intensity volume sort quickly, it’s past
getting stage you're, just like feeling beat time energy going
down, just not feeling like recovered. Now overreaching stage,
story kind tell always years ago working wife Natasha
garage training something like comes stumbling
look Eyes like eyeballs, giant she's, just like wobbling she's.
Like effed up, like mean like effed she's? Just like, read
program wrong like Trump like what'd. like supposed
10 sets three every minute minute three sets ten every minute
minute absolutely wrecked. couldn't move hours afterwards
days, she's. Just like handle kids like, can't get bed.
can't move like classic example right like don't need fix recovery
here, you're, just dummy, dream way hard long like not
don't problem here. it’s situation like that, it’s generally just program
way off. it’s constantly happening you're, just like man like whatever reason,
every while, getting really sore really bad performance
workouts, need go stress bucket. Take look allostatic load
allostasis get figured happening um.




00:48:19 Overreaching vs. Overtraining

happy pointed distinction functional overreaching, training
trained. think one one common mistake people make thinking
biology generally think terms nouns adjectives not verbs amazing.
love much know, biology collection processes processes depending
live, trained trained state that,
many ways, adjective trained trained. It’s like saying, uh,
know American, know Czechoslovakian whatever happens, right
many ways people start associate identity, least transient identity,
start making sorts decisions. sounds like sorts verbs will
will not engage in, whereas think look things processes assign verbs
them, can say: okay, functionally overreaching truly training,
matter Degrees, correct right training matter, not reaching,
not functionally reaching it’s just it’s just performance, know, just
nervous system, won't change unless give reason reason why,
can Perform something perfectly speak language perfectly. no rewiring
nervous system. myth told every experience rewires
nervous system, it’s different now two seconds ago. That’s that’s ridiculous,
illogical statement. know. That’s not true nervous system can perform something,
no reason change won't muscles way.
progressively overload learn something new challenge muscle
something new, it’s thing. example gave uh wife
workout turned far strenuous, functionally overreach.
sense, might training heading direction training,
mistake assume trained right, kind it’s almost becomes
bit state character assignment um, opposed verb, case,
no perfect way describe - talking nouns adjectives also
um talking verbs. think verbs really anchored processes
things actions can take um. may, like just highlight this,
idea shifting one sinking towards verb actions rather labels state
happen person happen right. Sometimes even become
kind character. Logical way people describe uh, believe
something called training training real words,
don't ever really know trained, nailed it. there's. No, know it’s
not like red flag. Uh, know shoots shoulder say trained.


know it’s um, so, hope can start thinking verbs,
actions can take order ensure stimulate Progressive, overload
one way another time, don't fall bins character
assignment suddenly decide need X like take month off
something like that, beginning realize um discussion that’s
exactly wrong way go. fantastic points want make sure clear
no clinical diagnosis training. no standards, no test
blood panel. can pull. actually identify state.
distinction Here, Andrew verbs, rather nouns is, wonderful
exactly case. way really come retroactively, diagnose
one training is, had. weeks recovery got back
Baseline, can't moment. can't take single test, no subjective
marker anything says trained. simply, probably training,
need reverse quickly case step probably non-
functionally overreaching. continue this, will probably enter new stage
training need come back. that’s important thing
let people know no one thing actually point says

00:52:53 Tool: Acute Overload & Recovery, Breathwork

not noun, verb. tools can use
enhance recovery yep? start off acute overload phase. So, words,
just workout feeling awful just one two days ago super sore.
get rid right now? Well, couple things can immediately
workout others maybe actionable day later two days
later just cover handful them. nutrition hydration
supplementation next episode. going cover everything else, not category
right now, couple things number one. can actually start Kickstart recovery
process end current training session, guess say way.
strongly suggest start recovery process immediately workout
mentioned earlier idea got get really high peak stress cause
adaptation, actually didn't explain correctly, happen
need extremely High peak, met extremely sharp
recovery back down, know talked
neuroplasticity stuff terms happen caused insult.


immediately need able recover make sure causes changes brains
thing happens here. need really sharp high inflammatory response
then, not meet immediate recovery period, signal won't
maximize results. mean can actually couple things? Number
one actually listening slow, paced, music evidence suggest fast-paced music
may slow recovery slow pace actually enhance it. just change
know maximum get get going music workout
slower, lower Cadence will help kick start idea similar note. can also
use call regulation breathing. conjunction one
other, whichever you, personal favorite method somewhere
three ten minutes finishing training session. Laying like
position, certainly Lotus position, think laying back
generally effective personal preference there, no science, like items
covered getting dark quiet sort area Then, just breathing nose
structured, Cadence, lot different things. can try easy example. just
box breathing can imagine box four squares. going
inhale somewhere between, like three eight seconds whatever number
choose, keep tempo, say chose five second inhale,
that’s going take vertically horizontally box five second hold
five second exhale five second hold, just need repeat
time domain. Now typically honestly don't use timer you'll, actually notice. lot
people will like fall asleep get really close falling asleep period. can
triangle version that, inhale, hold exhale go right back
inhale bunch different tricks. can try here, need play around
see actually works best you. Um 10 minutes probably better, can just
least give three that'll work, really really resistant, can actually that. Just
shower, going finish workout get shower again, just close
eyes shower, give three minutes focused relaxation breathing will
accelerate recovery process. love particularly love laboratory
works stress respiration, okay, breathing interactions two
just mention result just accepted publication, time day.
uh. Thank you. Uh beautiful work uh, not directly, although took
place lab, know, it’s students doctors um, Dr Melise uh, balbon
uh lab. It’s phenomenal researcher showed short period five minutes
box breathing exactly type described cyclic sign two inhales, followed
extended exhale lungs empty. Ideally, inhales done nose.


exhales done. Uh mouth, although done nose, um
mouth matter, probably nose. Nose inhale, inhale mouth exhale
um uh inhales, nose exhale nose. Cyclic sighing,
refer done five minutes, produce significant decreases resting
heart rate. time will increase things like heart rate, variability
forth. Um provided extended exhales. seems like calming response,
reduction overall stress occurs. thing really sends things
direction something like cyclic hyperventilation. sure observed um
interestingly uh, people just five minutes meditation which,
which, course, breathing just allowing breathing progress.
However, happens moment, um moments across five minutes uh.
reductions sorts markers stress described not significant
breathing. love Brock's breathing tool, post, workout, um
Alternatives too, just mentioned, think people greatly underestimate
potency breathing shifting one's nervous system function away stress one
wants toward alertness stress. actually couple questions
sure. think audience appreciate uh. long boxes? just
user selected great question, use carbon dioxide tolerance test amazing order
people determine long different sides Box be, cover
carbon dioxide tolerance tests. previous episode, can provide link clip um
show, note captions, but, point out, involves long extended exhale lungs,
empty um and, course, people sit lungs empty, accurately
Faithfully say report long took empty lungs. use
gauge. Typically, takes, people go lungs empty 20 seconds less, believe
go back paper look, believe duration sides
boxes were, somewhere um two three seconds,
CO2 discard time anywhere uh 20 seconds 40 45 seconds, use it.
sides box, believe, four six seconds people
longer discard Arrow period minute more. used
box duration inhale, hold exhale, hold duration somewhere between. believe
[ Music, ], um, seven, maybe eight long 11 12 seconds yeah.
will get kind free diver types. can really this? really well
trained sort thing? don't quote exactly numbers,
approximate. line exactly done. believe it’s it’s going
close within seconds non-important Distinction. it’s going close enough,
that’s great, uh. took six weeks. study done


period month swapped new pattern breathing um,
condition meditation condition - done natural world, say, um
wearing whoop bands. getting heart rate, heart rate, variability, sleep,
data, subjective data mood Etc. lot measures, um
100 subjects wild life um tried best track life, stress
events exercise, things like harder control outside laboratory.
Really results speak exactly exactly describing here,
deliberate respiration involves controlled holds exhales really dramatic
immediate impact reducing levels stress. That’s wonderful! not surprised
findings really interesting that, mentioned
exhalation portion primarily responsible regulation that’s actually goes
back previous endurance conversation, general rest, non-altitude
increases Co2 primary driver ventilation, generally means
inhales associated uptick sympathetic State exhales associated
uptick parasympathetic State. generally, folks will things like exhale
finish exhale right perform high Precision, neurological tasks.
going say, aim Target shoot going Exhale fully almost
always execute movement end exhale, that’s
highest parasympathetic State lowest drive ventilation. say not surprised
guys found actually data point individuals, particularly
endurance. Training can get back Baseline heart rate going
correlated with. gets actual results training. Said take
bunch individuals put endurance training program,
measure quickly can get back Baseline workout general,
folks better going see greater improvements Performance
end say, four six eight week, training block little bit
causation correlation untie. think it’s enough say: hey
invest three case study five minutes. It’s going
enhance recovery, likelihood increasing results training, now
also additional benefits like able transition appropriately next
task, going work going see family whatever thing is, it’s it’s nice close to,
asked high, sympathetic State body, asked perform
stress. gave recovery now ready transition next thing
don't take exercise energy. will next

01:03:39 Tool: Alleviate Acute Soreness, Compression Clothing



task may may not want sympathetic Drive state. somebody sore
following workout, either locally sore muscle, group group muscles, maybe
legs chest torso maybe whole body sore sometimes case.
tools can Implement order accelerate the? want call
moving soreness, it’s really, know, alleviation soreness
bunch different processes. effective tools push back
soreness dissipate yeah? Absolutely. First all, it’s not lactate! That’s just really
important thing still hear people talk about. know sore 24 hours later
got thing get lactate there, talked metabolism,
uh conversation episode not cause fatigue it’s certainly not
cause soreness. not actionable tip there, just pet peeve mine. hear
people say get irritated can maybe end conversation um strategies,
tools, can do, can actually wear compression gear will help little
bit. decent amount evidence, suggesting, just you, know, put
tighter fitting clothes Leisure, wear compression gear. can
actually prevent little bit soreness occurring. case poor
Natasha - realize just done way way much went hung
bow hunting friend trained way hard, realize, oh, goodness,
going sore here. can immediately put compression gear weigh
really long possible. examples compression gear? seen
people plane high high socks um, mean anything wear
compression gear exercise. whether just know,
compression pants leggings tight fitting leggings uh, whether long sleeve
shirt, that’s like rash guard, wear know Jiu, Jitsu surfing, something
like that. long it’s tight fitting, doesn't much can wear.
suppose get socks, great, generally just tell leads them.
put long sleeve compression shirts wear training
long, compression, leggings that'd fine. Can people apply compression
um Garb training still get positive effects yeah? not seen
evidence suggest block adaptation. may case. not aware
studies happens, certainly know information suggests can
hands little bit Muscle Recovery. ideally one knows workout
trigger lot soreness yeah compression gear sort
offset that, local muscle groups working
Reason asked socks understanding. socks uh, compression


socks people plane it’s going shift patterns blood flow, not just
lower legs, body yeah you're, probably going want focus
actual exercising tissue, though, Actually, that’s really good question. don't know
answer whether not upper body workout lower body compression
gear. actually help that’s great question. may done. don't know,
don't know answer general, just tell people like where, whole
thing much can um, actually not concerned wearing
workout. something put afterwards even wear just little bit
compression day. Um actually really fun study. Uh. collaborated
um Bill Kramer who's. Uh, know, Sports scientist Year award. bill Cramer
award, gives indication uh University Connecticut, well Lee
Brown, two Lifetime Achievement Award winners put people plane
stores, Connecticut flew Cal State Fullerton. cross-country flight
got wear compression gear flight others not,
landed California training bout put back plane, went back stores
think another training bout got back there. lot data
came paper, one things clear compression group
effective handling blood related coagulation issues associated
long flights particularly athletic performance. that’s actually sneaky little Insider trick
use lot people, particularly athletes traveling, just wear
compression gear plane. talked sort rung study
mind another effective strategy, compression gear general, well
particularly plane, basically tighter can get better, without obviously
making hands purple uncomfortable things like that, doesn't
overly tight. Anything will work probably help. also personally,
anytime, taking

01:08:27 Tool: Acute Soreness, Massage, Temperature

flight like much can just feel little better get there.
methods can use alleviate acute soreness? Well, continue
theme, saying okay, use sort pressure manipulation
enhance recovery. compression one strategy, can also use things like compression
boots garments, nomadic devices will know, pump uh air outside
compress back forth. number devices will this. can


also use physical hand, massage body work they're, really
working best. can tell mechanisms effectively moving fluid
tissue, well potentially enhancing blood flow, increasing capitalization
going get nutrients waste products out. can kind pick
choose based upon budget preferences availability timing, things like that,
effective strategies outside really next largest category, now
thermal uh, far discussion, mentioned cold water, Immersion
talked hypertrophy section not want immediately: post
exercise, getting cold water ice bath trying grow muscle
mass. said that, good evidence showing cold water immersion
specifically effective reducing muscle soreness. fair consideration it’s
classic example no free passes physiology. Nothing always good
always bad. It’s always willing give versus willing
get case like cold water immersion? may thinking yeah. might want
hypertrophic adaptations, phase training,
actually trying push towards optimization moment, rather long-term
adaptation, ice bath might great choice. addition, fall scenario
like Natasha - realize like just unbelievably sore - might cost three
four five six days training. might worth accelerate recovery
process couple days don't miss much training. it’s just it’s
algorithm, it’s equation. looking season trying compete
just done way way much exercise, really significant pain.
probably willing give small percentage eventual muscle growth
single session get pain cold strategies. Cold water immersion clearly
best approach rather cold air tactics. cold shower probably
not enough here. really want either moderately cold. maybe 40 50
degree, water probably north 15 minutes can sub 40 little maybe
five minutes get fact number studies um.
sort summarizing bunch kind one rather going Point
point. numbers just threw uh, assuming um uh Fahrenheit um,
seem seem really cold right uncomfortably cold. Absolutely always recommend
people ease protocol overall not immediately go 35 degree uh
cold water, never done uh. said, people comfortable
uncomfortable, always answer question: cold exactly?
agree very, cold much really really want get out,
able stay safely? Whatever value happens be, absolutely


need safe. said that, actually, xbt Retreats, put dozens, not
hundreds people point, uh immediately sub 35 degree water first time
ever done. know three minutes multiple rounds session, can handle it.
don't need go crazy. don't want kind play game right,
want really really cold short amount time, want like kind
cold longer amount time? really mistake can make
something like know, 65 degree water people not comfortable
know five ten minutes. It’s just not going be. It’s probably not going
effective. like man 35 is, absolutely crazy want 55 degree, water
literature area. it’s going say need probably
somewhere, almost really north 10 minutes, will actually show need
like well north 20 30 minutes. money rather go really really
cold get done five minutes, um personal preference one. can also
make little bit easier yourself. not nearly much evidence,
contrast. Stuff uh, go cold, hot sort back forth.
no really good rules terms much go, many rounds, long
cold long hot couple studies obviously
studies use numbers, doesn't mean tested See optimal,
big difference, can really just kind play feel hot good
Recovery. just careful going put blood flow
area, may walk additional acute swelling isn't going
put greater pressure there. kind play that. personally really like
hot Recovery. will feel - maybe not great moment, next day tend feel
really really good. addition, wake next morning really really hurting
super stiff, hot bath will help um quite bit, can play
protocols. Again, don't

01:14:21 Cold & Heat Contrast, Cold Shower vs. Immersion, Sauna & Fertility

nice absolutely no requirement so. just option interested
studies Dr Susanna soberg sure yeah not directly aimed alleviating soreness
recovery, increasing thermal capacity storage uh Brown adipose
tissue, not blubbery fat stuff around clavicles around heart help
generate body, heat rest metabolism on, numbers um
come not tested possible derivations just like


breathing. five minute sessions, knows? Maybe minute
equally effective. just constraints sorts studies, values
come with, seem good thresholds making sure
adaptation response triggered heat cold. ends 57 minutes per week,
total uncomfortable safe heat case sauna, can one session
breaking couple sessions day different days, 11
minutes per week. cold either one single session multiple sessions, one
um one break know multiple days one day
one. know hour sauna 11 minutes colder vice versa,
although seems little bit extreme, especially uninitiated.
numbers studied. point out, not lot really thorough
studies examining different cold protocols according temperature time requirements.
bit subjective, feel required establish routine, actually say
another time re-emphasize something. talked beginning
conversation, pain not defined outcome. It’s heavily influenced
perception, so, don't feel like work you, won't work. feel like
work fantastic, so. It’s challenging field get really objective data
always going little bit subjective nature. things, can tell
anecdotally: used hot cold contrast long time athletes. love
don't care everything between. it’s one things never
mandate it. course, can't mandate anything anyone work with, never
know like hey. interested great struggling area? want try this?
liked great struggling area, tried it. didn't love it.
Okay, fine, not find routes, will get lot ways enhance
recovery um. one hasn't even really come stopping problem
first place, not just treating symptoms, first line defense,
really need go back figure it’s happening begin with, Solution,
just different acute symptom management tactics. One final point uh,
deliberate, cold exposure. think worth mentioning one reasons shower
effective, not nearly effective cold water, immersion immersion ice
neck simply reason stated before, showers not
going get cold not going get know sub 40s. Also cold
showers haven't really studied much have, not nearly much
immersion people always ask just think challenges studying cold water
exposure shower, can't really control mango? much body
covered, whether not head stays different size bodies, Etc? Whereas


people come laboratory, can get cold large, know neck
is. know chin can make sure people's arms um legs
underneath, cold shower sure can make everyone face away toward
shower, it’s really tricky um variations described. said,
agree one wants use deliberate cold exposure, cold shower better
nothing cold immersion circulating, cold water ice bath better um
cold shower yeah? actually say looking recovery muscle soreness,
say cold shower, probably little, not going able
get enough cold water onto muscle, besides, basically head, maybe
try cold bath least get surface area coverage, yeah want
use cold shower awesome reasons cold shower. That’s totally great.
trying use recover low back glutes sore training
good way, it’s probably not going much immersion there.
actually also hit sneaky point, is, can't get water super cold, just
make water move. Jets stuff can turn anyone tried
like. Okay, can 40 degree. Bath awesome, try 60, water
moving right, break thermal layer. Normally little thin layer
water heating up. break up. It’s whole new world, yeah, absolutely
still cold. Water actually weaker way go correct can make
face stoic, make body circulate water around long
this. Maybe just one point heat uh: certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry,
sauna, steam saunas. Excuse me, jacuzzis can work pretty well yep um uh males.
looking conceive 60 days following uh uh following sauna um, hot tub realize
approaches severely limit number motile sperm um
substantially. people not trying conceive uh. Don'T think works
reliably enough, use form contraception yeah, people
trying conceive. really detrimental sperm Health right reason
people bring ice pack put groin near groin go
um, hard hot tub sauna. getting fine points,
um crude points, will pun intended, um, idea wouldn't want
anyone approach techniques compromise life goals, certainly not
allowed anywhere near things. uh, stage Life, just say
Natasha put x hanging Laird. reasons, like you're, not
going you're, not going none stuff, just wait right heat um heat


sperm relationship it’s not one that’s positive sperm


01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques

ways combine various types stimuli described inducing
recovery? talked breathing based tools which, adjust indeed
adjust oxygen carbon dioxide ratios Etc. guessing major effect
recovery going neural. It’s going deliberate, calm nervous system,
sympathetic, based uh, mentioned, yeah definitely, talked
movement based touch-based approaches. Um, will uh movement
circulate, certainly will circulate blood, also will generate contractions muscles yep
right, maybe, if, indeed again, still speculates you, indeed soreness
due excessive stretch swelling stretch, ends muscles
make sense movement touch thermal, ways combine
um effective maybe even synergistic yeah. suppose throw uh
compression garments put Pneumatic compression device sit sauna.
regulate breath like fine. Quite honestly, though,
probably don't need maximize them. joking. probably go
light swim regulating breathing cold water. get compression
cold, water good spot, certainly that. reality
is. generally look physical approach holistic approach breath
work. Basically, want breath something else knock two things
good spot, breath thermal stress, just
controlling unregulation stuff. also remember ice stressor
actually show data second actually can enhance
systemic recovery, although won't happen acute minutes. fact, it’s going
take least 30 60 minutes eventually see rebound effect, acutely it’s
going make actually sympathetic, going direction. can
opposite can actually drive up. it’s little bit dependent upon
respond, time day you're, using general, guess combining
need um, depending available. perhaps don't
sauna, can take hot bath great. Maybe percussion device
tool can use that. don't sauna amazing. don't ice bath


things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

soreness fact can quite sore exercise no measurable amount
muscle damage much like anything else. idea pain, it’s not
one-to-one explanation. multiple factors probably causing perception
pain. Muscle damage can one them. not one, probably
opinion, though yet shown definitively, probably not even leading cause
it, actually happening. Well, reason is, taking 24 48 hours can
actually find various papers, literature reviews dating back number years now
decade show wonderful curves inflammatory immune response,
don't need necessarily go entire physiology right now effectively
happening things little bit time delay, steps
happen immediately like right. exercise
delayed six 24 48 hours. know little bit physiology, it’s
combination neutrophils macrophages bunch things happening,
Time sequence. happens time get 28 48 hour window now
muscle soreness kicks wait minute I, result muscles
torn, happened immediately, wouldn't pain start immediately well, Answer
would, first clue that’s not responsible it. look
immune response - see actually Peak 24 48 hours later
that’s time, pain kicked in. That’s cooling problem,
immune response happening inflammation. Then, sudden start getting fluid
accumulation now called nociceptors you're, probably
obviously, familiar these, pain receptors. What’s actually
interesting, don't necessarily know lot information many pain receptors
muscle they're, not really belly? fact, can perform muscle
biopsies don't really hurt. mean belly muscle, correct yeah.
pressure sensors, though, so, change volume tissue, will
respond quickly, enhancing swelling actual muscle.
immediately putting pressure pressure receptors. will that’s signal,
probably happening here, just just hate give another bone. lot
delayed muscle. Soreness probably just neural feedback loop, rather
actual muscle damage yeah. makes lot sense lot interactions
types neurons control touch, sensation pain, sensation itch sensation. fact,
lot people um kind collapse itch pain together, Bingo yeah, know, that’s
something, it’s painful itches familiar thing people mosquito bites um
and, course, classic gait theory pain yeah, uh People will familiar
explain explaining um, something hurts


know Bonk knee stub toe. tend grab body part try
rub totally, rubbing not coincidental thing. activates set uh touch:
sensors are, respond kind broad dull touch um actively inhibits
release inhibitory neurotransmitter, fibers control pain signal.
anytime rub know like charlie horse, leg stub toe, we,
know wince, grab tone got like squeezing little bit. That’s
actually deactivating partially inactivating pain mechanism. idea uh
swelling response trigger neural response then, recruit pain,
receptor response here, using broad, broad, brush um Strokes explain um
makes good sense

00:11:35 Muscle Spindles, Reduce Soreness

Um now, now explained process works, can actually even
add that. remember muscles work, sort
signal nervous system actually go tell muscle contract. Well
remember: episodes ago. covered physiology called
motor unit, okay. Well, didn't explain called muscle spindles
talked proprioception episode well, never tied picture
together. let walk really quickly it’s going tie Loop
nice bow. happens um? motor unit coming called
alpha motor unit that’s going innervating muscle, fibers, that’s going tell
muscle fibers contract. typically spread throughout uh. sides
muscle interior, exterior outside, though another type muscle,
called muscle spindle. Now non-contractiles, don't actin
myosin don't produce Force. responsive, proprioceptive.
means sense stretch, why, example, stretch
hamstring stretch muscle group, doesn't really matter muscle. innate
response fire back close distance, keeps say
leaning right, can imagine example give is, you're, standing
one foot, start swaying right. right, say standing right
foot, makes easier folks start swaying right like you're, going
fall right ear will hit ground. inside right, calf muscle will start
stretched. outside will start compressed right, stretch inside
right calf muscle will sense stretch will respond Contracting pulls back


middle stops falling. That’s proprioception muscle spindles sense
stretch tell contract way work gamma motor neurons,
sensory things. happening unlike tell muscle
contract. goes Alpha muscle contract. muscle spindles work oh
stretched, sends signal back Central Point, typically spinal cord,
don't actually want go way up. brain got time delay.
subconscious autonomic right versus somatic, gamma going go back
central location come back Alpha motor neurons
contract. wonderful mechanism sensing stretch going back. Well, one
Theory that’s put forward regarding muscle damage pressure actually
applied nerve endings muscle spindles, that’s actually responsible
pain signal. That’s going back coming brain registering
pain. Rather actually contractile units, muscle fibers that’s
intriguing idea, uh, suggest stretching muscles order alleviate
soreness might exact incorrect thing do. Yeah. Now, not saying that’s sure
certain just building off mechanistic logic laid here, yeah, really
laid here, effective principle based exactly that, is.
generally low level movement effective reducing acute soreness, that’s
low-level contraction muscles going anti-stretch get tissue
get fluid out. Wow you're, literally pumping cell. Yes previous
episode, talking programming, using Wii, fair
educating us, including me, um audience different structures
programming, exercise, specific adaptations Etc month week, year, scales, Etc.
brief um discussion fact one trains legs hard resistance
training, know heavy squatting dead, lifting yeah or,
soreness oftentimes quote-unquote lighter cardio um. uh low
impact work. next day number different things involve um, not high
intensity contractions muscles, require contractions muscles
can alleviate soreness quickly one Simply lie around. know.
Watch Netflix something yeah, that’s exactly right, um go back just little bit well
that’s really case um. question like: inflammatory signal coming
much learned there, little bit information right now
suggests it’s potentially coming free radicals released mitochondria
may may not hold research comes, not sure, remember
back uh conversation endurance, talked electron transport chain
aerobic metabolism regardless whether not getting energy


glycolysis carbohydrates, remember, finished aerobic
Metabolism, even lifting weights using carbs fuel,
got finish metabolism running mitochondria Performing oxidative
metabolism. result electron transport chain runs. So, theoretically, free
radicals, hyper-reactive oxygen species, basically oxygen
molecules missing electrons, react lot things,
opposite antioxidants. way, oxygen molecules extra protons,
can balance charge leak going massive,
inflammatory signal that’s probably signals cause neutrophils
macrophages kicks off entire Cascade again, believe need research
there. need look it. Maybe it’s definitive know, that’s probably
happening potentially happening rather causes Cascade Signal. Also,
combination of. Well, that’s case, not getting
tremendous amount muscle damage aerobic based exercise? Well,
don't mechanical tension pulling fibers, that’s actually causing
damage cell wall allows free radicals escape mitochondria
cell wall. that’s best. can postulate moment things
happening low level exercise tends enhance even things like
percussion, using either instruments put low level vibration leg like
pneumatic boots. can massage things generally probably helping
moving stuff demon specifically pressure comes off
nerve, endings muscle spindles, allows stop receiving signal
pain. Despite fact didn't actually regenerate tissue yet fascinating,
think beautifully frames headed next, talk different
modes recovery accelerate perhaps even combine different
forms recovery order become better recovering make faster
progress Fitness

00:18:56 Exercise, Homeostasis & Hormesis; Blood Test & Fitness Level

kick off discussion recovery understanding recovery
specific adaptations exercise actually occur. love share us
happens needs happen recovery order us get better anything,
endurance, strength, Etc, also specific types exercise, stimuli specific types
adaptations trigger running bit further. Lifting bit weight, slowing


Cadence given movement, Etc. specific types triggers adaptation relate
specific maybe similar types recovery required us make progress
one previous episodes. talking Harvard fatigue lab really
identified idea homeostasis least sort championed that’s important
levels physiology wants return homeostasis. happens terms
adaptation? challenged level realizes? not make change,
will not able get back level homeostasis. That’s fundamentally
happening. recovery, process taking insult temporarily reduced
functionality, causing change now come back get often call
support performance super compensation. really doing, though, bringing
new level homeostasis effectively. understanding insult comes again.
need able make sure doesn't cause level disruption,
raise bar whether enhancing ability take level mechanical
tension muscle not result micro damage. Whether able take
reduction energy not compromise sleep anything, it’s really
fundamentally changing. can new level homeostasis, it’s
presuming it’s predicting insult going come road.
wanted clarify people Dr Galvin says insult may actually insult me,
um insult nerd speak terminology sort damage inflicted tissue
system. um speaking insult muscle insult neuromuscular
connection, created adding weight bar running distance um running
bit fast pedaling faster. creates micro insult insult. now,
everyone familiar um, psychological verbal insults, never forget
biological concept, it’s important. tag another thing here, called hormesis. It’s
one favorite phenomenon, effectively means dosage
toxicity, responds almost everything. think context say
drugs, means is, gave 10 milligrams something okay,
give 20 it'd problem eventually, go give enough, thing
turns toxic: case everything cyanide, can actually small
dosages nature. fact, it’s many fruits eat, it’s not dosage,
doesn't matter dosage gets higher, though actually can cause problems,
high enough, can actually kill instantaneously. back end that, though,
introduce micro insult framed perfectly, body will
adapt it, that’s really happening exercise adaptation is, hormetic
stressor that’s important is, look immediate responses exercise
see extremely large increase inflammation, see, oxidative stress, see whole


Cascade autophagy, like problems quote unquote happening. It’s actually
quite funny. is, part PhD, academic portion. go
medical side school, physiology class med school,
non-medical doctor class right, PhD. leave lab. walk across
campus take physiology class folks died whole time internally,
every time cover new area, basically exact value
number medical setting like. Oh, gosh they're, going die performance
setting like person's fantastic shape. I've? Never still amuses day,
obviously, it’s just simple things like total blood volume right cover like
okay, patient come blood volume six liters, know can
immediately get diuretic sort going heart attack
blood pressure gets right now, immediately thinking damn six leaders
person super fit actually positive adaptation training it’s one
important, not important Adaptation endurance training enhance, total
blood volume, store blood body fit less
fit. mean go things. Sodium concentrations - potassium
concentrations like look things paper don't know person
die 65 years old shape person going break
world record marathon. brings important tangent, uh,
instance, go take blood test - somebody exercises
intensely uh resistance training, blood creatinine levels can way range,
physician doesn't know certain forms exercise might say:
wow, lot muscle tissue damage occurring body yeah, mentioned
before, total blood volume is, dangerously High, fact, far healthier
need much fitter person who, numbers range, said,
obviously um limits statements, whereby want
cautious take action ameliorate, elevated blood, creatinine level something
sort. point bringing also one field medicine,
many, not all, many Physicians don't take consideration uh outside
activities people doing, becomes kind plug-and-play type, um type
Way looking blood charts, yeah done many thousand athletes, blood chemistry
uh. don't use. First all, never look disease stuff, that’s not do.
take people healthy try optimize performance blood. Chemistry one
best tools. really understand there, can get
incredibly powerful information blood chemistry actually relates
going talk today terms measuring everything acute Chronic dehydration


sleep, deprivation can identified blood Chemistry optimization improvements
nutrition, supplementation lot can get there. people interested field,
Point gentleman named Dan Garner. just absolute Juggernaut
wizard blood chemistry high performance, well can get ton information
that. understand difference exactly talked about. Looking
signals increased risk cardiovascular events, 25 years road versus, this:
optimal value high performance athlete, database
software stuff does, looking things. going talk
biomarkers look little

00:30:20 Recovery Timescales, Adaptation & Optimization

Bit later salivary blood stuff, maybe save part conversation
road. Tell different time scales recovery. Sure actually
trying answer question got way off track, reason
brought Hermetic thing is: understand things acute say, 24
40 hour period, look terrible. It’s actually fine right, stimuli, that’s causing
adaptation. reason brought medical exchange you,
looked inflammatory markers mentioned them, see
highest acute within seconds minutes hours exercise. However, that’s
exactly stimuli needed bring chronically, okay chronically meaning.
Maybe moment elevated maybe coming 24 hours later
48 hours. However, compare resting level say Monday,
worked resting level, Monday week following week following that,
probably see Baseline inflammation goes down, got
really careful. talking immediately post-exercise man, markers look terrible?
Maybe recovery score awful, Etc. That’s not necessarily bad thing,
like looking not change happening today, trying
cause adaptation may take us weeks months actually access. love
highlighting principle, one obvious ones now said
heart rate. Absolutely. heart rate goes very, high exercise,
fairly consistently even semi-consistently. resting heart rate will actually quite bit
lower. That’s fantastic example! Really getting concept,
think it’s important differentiate adaptation optimization. Now hear
word use scientists hate it, it’s good communication tool, optimization


optimizing current moment, almost surely compromising late
adaptation right. If, say, thing right now makes feel absolute
best world like great, took nap donut like awesome,
feel amazing, know it’s causing long-term issues. can said
back end, never choosing things make better right now, never
actually going see adaptation. really recovery
conversation playing game balancing immediate gratification leg
gratification, identify much now versus not? use value
marker? Whether tired feel today, sore today versus score
app tracking metric, blood marker, anything understand. that’s
need cause adaptation, want week month, three months now
case athletes, it’s even four years right, trying cause
adaptations will get us want get Olympics World Championships
World Cup, wherever going that’s framework, think
recovery. maybe falsely think need maximize recovery today
something like taken anti-inflammatory, whether supplementation
drug, maybe ice. Oh cool, that’s great! will enhance recovery
moment. That'Ll make feel better today, probably tomorrow, know
blocks signal adaptation, not going get results. know four
six, eight weeks now. talk recovery, understand tool
am. using order that, understand training
trying maximize middle season athlete
competing tomorrow, going head towards Acute recovery right
actuate performance right now, starting off season, not hedging towards
recovery, actually hedging towards adaptation, not going deploy these,
especially things like evidence combination vitamin C vitamin E will
blunt hypertrophic adaptations anti-inflammatory antioxidants right
Studies shown? Maybe don't uh inhibitory fact may may not
point conceptually. want careful trying optimize for,
forethought alone going dictate decision making
whether not get eyes uh now will cover tools, Like
massage pretty fine use, don't worry blocking

00:35:10 Adaptation & Biomarkers Levels



Long-Term adaptation, others going want careful
principle laid us, set events occur
exercise trigger adaptation sets motion number adaptations
occur recovery give us exact opposite response trigger
go back heart rate example: um heart rate close maximal maximal.
enough times within short know week two weeks resting
heart rate goes down. recall episodes ago, said maximum heart rate
doesn't really change. much. correct? Yes, okay, resting heart rate can
go quite bit yep. general theme meaning less set
upper limit ceiling things like inflammatory markers heart rate, maybe even things
like stress deliberately trigger stress dramatic increase
heart rate dramatic Increase inflammatory markers lowering floor,
ceiling Remains Same. It’s dependent upon marker, case
maximum heart rate, will not change exception one thing age, brings
down. Training will not change circumstances. look something like
inflammatory response, suppose, theoretically, ceiling, though not aware
um. can tell right now, looking blood markers, things like creatine kinase,
remember conversation metabolism use phosphocreatine
one primary fuel sources explosive exercise. Well, using phosphocreatine
creatine kinase, remember, kinase enzymes function break things
part, creatine kinase enzyme use break creatine
that. lot, creatine kinase gets muscle seeps blood
myoglobin actually another fantastic marker. way, myoglobin is, think
hemoglobin blood, molecule carries oxygen around it’s
muscle tissue. it’s myoglobin mild, meaning muscle it’s globulin thing.
bunch markers can look muscle breakdown one things
can see creatine kinase level. That’s elevated say, um, one bout exercise and,
might, might up. know five six-fold. actually seen number
offensive lineman NFL, something like 500 plus fold, even within just one
category next. number can get extraordinarily high know actually
one important Point here, paying attention mechanistic research
use you're, using inform decision making, extraordinarily careful
magnitude Mean is, running western blot looking
signaling protein um muscle uh activation protein turn mitochondrial
biogenesis, saw whatever intervention gave it, whether nutrition thing
drug exercise - saw signaling protein increased 20 percent.


basically assume totally physiologically irrelevant, order
important, totally depends market looking at, markers
might need see four five six hundred fold increase before. know will actually
enough call physiologically relevant others one two percent
relevant, really want careful either reading papers
looking Social Media stuff. people just talking this, marker increase much,
may not matter, may totally irrelevant physiologically,
also, wondering like hell are, people. Well, that’s can
trick little bit intentionally not. just trying best,
don't really understand area enough, that’s important point pay attention to.
So. answer question fully, hard determine truly
maximum level um. things don't want move like blood pH. doesn't really want
move range going move from, know like 6.8 7.4, get
like 7.9, like you're, probably big big big trouble, things can go 500 5 000
fold, markers will really determine answer well point future.
love continue discussion around topic stress, specifically yeah um,
maybe will get little bit later today um get use deliberate
cold exposure, that’s certainly um effects related directly temperature
tissue. certainly mental effects terms raising one's level perceived pain. It’s
fun um, people love people love feeling get it.
Um deliberate cold exposure. people like feeling get not
unlike exercise totally. love train. love exercise, know many people uh um.
loathe exercise, love feeling afterward. will theme will
come back to. Thank indulging interest

00:40:36 4 Recovery Levels, Enhance Recovery

semi-tangent, think it’s relevant tangent thing, can now return
us different time, scales, yeah modes recovery, think
headed get better recovery. Yep. talk tools, talk
measure identify four distinct levels, level one call
overload just quickly means is. workout today. sign
symptom overload fatigued. Acute performance down, worked hard right
now. go, try maximum effort, reduced ability.
recovery period acute overload minutes days right. That’s generally, call


acute overload that’s looking right. systems theoretically
see hormetic stressor come back response, come back, bigger, better, efficient,
Etc. continue training state, like us, say workout
today, little bit acute overload going work tomorrow. little acute
overload can work next day little acute overload. Even took day
it’s doesn't matter right, just continue acute bouts insult
going pushing absolute golden Target, call functional
overreaching. reached can currently results
functional outcome, mean functionally performance enhanced
performance whatever deem stronger, you've, enhanced
muscle size, mitochondria improved you've, whatever thing is, it’s not just
physical performance thing right, amazing, recovery time functional overreaching
typically days maybe even week so, typically, see happen
prior competition. Individuals will call taper, reduced training
volume short period time, reason do. again.
Actualize phrase year adaptations, worked hard six
weeks know, theoretically, workouts. three four five six weeks ago,
allow, system recover will actualized, means performance will
enhanced. functional overreaching golden Target. Okay,
point functional overreaching - continue train intensified whether
intensity volume really. said earlier, something
holding back recovery. doesn't really matter right. It’s it’s sort two sides
coin. move call non-functional overreaching
reached again, now non-functional not see positive benefit
recovery allowed. typically means weeks takes weeks come back from,
basically just get back Baseline, lot folks end
vicious cycle, like man, not getting results. want. going train
harder, not getting results. want going train harder harder,
caught recovery isn't improved, just end spot. train
end spot end up. just either blowing quitting
not getting want. continue past point, may
actually actually call training typically, considered
trained takes months recover people think trained really
not you're. Just probably non-functionally overreached classic distinction is,
took three four days off felt better, weren't, probably quote unquote
trained. probably just area non-functional reaching. need little bit


back off - case. happen gymnasts
cheerleader things take month off barely seeing
start come back Baseline numbers. number areas, mood desire
train testosterone, cortisol ratios biomarkers number areas - physical performance,
vertical jump height, like things just start get back Baseline, true
training actually quite rare. Non-Functional overreaching much common
shorter time frame scale. talk recovery, four pieces
really thinking about, so, concerned about, oh super sore.
get less sore? either not sore next time? workout
super sorry. Now. recover playing first category overload
can certainly talk figure out. quick answer got go back
previous episodes just pay attention volume intensity recommendations
getting significantly uh damage fatigue workout? probably
increased volume quickly, something else dragging stress bucket down,
generally, problem training. Um either didn't warm sufficiently.
fueling strategy off talk Next Episode violated. One
principles increasing intensity volume sort quickly, it’s past
getting stage you're, just like feeling beat time energy going
down, just not feeling like recovered. Now overreaching stage,
story kind tell always years ago working wife Natasha
garage training something like comes stumbling
look Eyes like eyeballs, giant she's, just like wobbling she's.
Like effed up, like mean like effed she's? Just like, read
program wrong like Trump like what'd. like supposed
10 sets three every minute minute three sets ten every minute
minute absolutely wrecked. couldn't move hours afterwards
days, she's. Just like handle kids like, can't get bed.
can't move like classic example right like don't need fix recovery
here, you're, just dummy, dream way hard long like not
don't problem here. it’s situation like that, it’s generally just program
way off. it’s constantly happening you're, just like man like whatever reason,
every while, getting really sore really bad performance
workouts, need go stress bucket. Take look allostatic load
allostasis get figured happening um.




00:48:19 Overreaching vs. Overtraining

happy pointed distinction functional overreaching, training
trained. think one one common mistake people make thinking
biology generally think terms nouns adjectives not verbs amazing.
love much know, biology collection processes processes depending
live, trained trained state that,
many ways, adjective trained trained. It’s like saying, uh,
know American, know Czechoslovakian whatever happens, right
many ways people start associate identity, least transient identity,
start making sorts decisions. sounds like sorts verbs will
will not engage in, whereas think look things processes assign verbs
them, can say: okay, functionally overreaching truly training,
matter Degrees, correct right training matter, not reaching,
not functionally reaching it’s just it’s just performance, know, just
nervous system, won't change unless give reason reason why,
can Perform something perfectly speak language perfectly. no rewiring
nervous system. myth told every experience rewires
nervous system, it’s different now two seconds ago. That’s that’s ridiculous,
illogical statement. know. That’s not true nervous system can perform something,
no reason change won't muscles way.
progressively overload learn something new challenge muscle
something new, it’s thing. example gave uh wife
workout turned far strenuous, functionally overreach.
sense, might training heading direction training,
mistake assume trained right, kind it’s almost becomes
bit state character assignment um, opposed verb, case,
no perfect way describe - talking nouns adjectives also
um talking verbs. think verbs really anchored processes
things actions can take um. may, like just highlight this,
idea shifting one sinking towards verb actions rather labels state
happen person happen right. Sometimes even become
kind character. Logical way people describe uh, believe
something called training training real words,
don't ever really know trained, nailed it. there's. No, know it’s
not like red flag. Uh, know shoots shoulder say trained.


know it’s um, so, hope can start thinking verbs,
actions can take order ensure stimulate Progressive, overload
one way another time, don't fall bins character
assignment suddenly decide need X like take month off
something like that, beginning realize um discussion that’s
exactly wrong way go. fantastic points want make sure clear
no clinical diagnosis training. no standards, no test
blood panel. can pull. actually identify state.
distinction Here, Andrew verbs, rather nouns is, wonderful
exactly case. way really come retroactively, diagnose
one training is, had. weeks recovery got back
Baseline, can't moment. can't take single test, no subjective
marker anything says trained. simply, probably training,
need reverse quickly case step probably non-
functionally overreaching. continue this, will probably enter new stage
training need come back. that’s important thing
let people know no one thing actually point says

00:52:53 Tool: Acute Overload & Recovery, Breathwork

not noun, verb. tools can use
enhance recovery yep? start off acute overload phase. So, words,
just workout feeling awful just one two days ago super sore.
get rid right now? Well, couple things can immediately
workout others maybe actionable day later two days
later just cover handful them. nutrition hydration
supplementation next episode. going cover everything else, not category
right now, couple things number one. can actually start Kickstart recovery
process end current training session, guess say way.
strongly suggest start recovery process immediately workout
mentioned earlier idea got get really high peak stress cause
adaptation, actually didn't explain correctly, happen
need extremely High peak, met extremely sharp
recovery back down, know talked
neuroplasticity stuff terms happen caused insult.


immediately need able recover make sure causes changes brains
thing happens here. need really sharp high inflammatory response
then, not meet immediate recovery period, signal won't
maximize results. mean can actually couple things? Number
one actually listening slow, paced, music evidence suggest fast-paced music
may slow recovery slow pace actually enhance it. just change
know maximum get get going music workout
slower, lower Cadence will help kick start idea similar note. can also
use call regulation breathing. conjunction one
other, whichever you, personal favorite method somewhere
three ten minutes finishing training session. Laying like
position, certainly Lotus position, think laying back
generally effective personal preference there, no science, like items
covered getting dark quiet sort area Then, just breathing nose
structured, Cadence, lot different things. can try easy example. just
box breathing can imagine box four squares. going
inhale somewhere between, like three eight seconds whatever number
choose, keep tempo, say chose five second inhale,
that’s going take vertically horizontally box five second hold
five second exhale five second hold, just need repeat
time domain. Now typically honestly don't use timer you'll, actually notice. lot
people will like fall asleep get really close falling asleep period. can
triangle version that, inhale, hold exhale go right back
inhale bunch different tricks. can try here, need play around
see actually works best you. Um 10 minutes probably better, can just
least give three that'll work, really really resistant, can actually that. Just
shower, going finish workout get shower again, just close
eyes shower, give three minutes focused relaxation breathing will
accelerate recovery process. love particularly love laboratory
works stress respiration, okay, breathing interactions two
just mention result just accepted publication, time day.
uh. Thank you. Uh beautiful work uh, not directly, although took
place lab, know, it’s students doctors um, Dr Melise uh, balbon
uh lab. It’s phenomenal researcher showed short period five minutes
box breathing exactly type described cyclic sign two inhales, followed
extended exhale lungs empty. Ideally, inhales done nose.


exhales done. Uh mouth, although done nose, um
mouth matter, probably nose. Nose inhale, inhale mouth exhale
um uh inhales, nose exhale nose. Cyclic sighing,
refer done five minutes, produce significant decreases resting
heart rate. time will increase things like heart rate, variability
forth. Um provided extended exhales. seems like calming response,
reduction overall stress occurs. thing really sends things
direction something like cyclic hyperventilation. sure observed um
interestingly uh, people just five minutes meditation which,
which, course, breathing just allowing breathing progress.
However, happens moment, um moments across five minutes uh.
reductions sorts markers stress described not significant
breathing. love Brock's breathing tool, post, workout, um
Alternatives too, just mentioned, think people greatly underestimate
potency breathing shifting one's nervous system function away stress one
wants toward alertness stress. actually couple questions
sure. think audience appreciate uh. long boxes? just
user selected great question, use carbon dioxide tolerance test amazing order
people determine long different sides Box be, cover
carbon dioxide tolerance tests. previous episode, can provide link clip um
show, note captions, but, point out, involves long extended exhale lungs,
empty um and, course, people sit lungs empty, accurately
Faithfully say report long took empty lungs. use
gauge. Typically, takes, people go lungs empty 20 seconds less, believe
go back paper look, believe duration sides
boxes were, somewhere um two three seconds,
CO2 discard time anywhere uh 20 seconds 40 45 seconds, use it.
sides box, believe, four six seconds people
longer discard Arrow period minute more. used
box duration inhale, hold exhale, hold duration somewhere between. believe
[ Music, ], um, seven, maybe eight long 11 12 seconds yeah.
will get kind free diver types. can really this? really well
trained sort thing? don't quote exactly numbers,
approximate. line exactly done. believe it’s it’s going
close within seconds non-important Distinction. it’s going close enough,
that’s great, uh. took six weeks. study done


period month swapped new pattern breathing um,
condition meditation condition - done natural world, say, um
wearing whoop bands. getting heart rate, heart rate, variability, sleep,
data, subjective data mood Etc. lot measures, um
100 subjects wild life um tried best track life, stress
events exercise, things like harder control outside laboratory.
Really results speak exactly exactly describing here,
deliberate respiration involves controlled holds exhales really dramatic
immediate impact reducing levels stress. That’s wonderful! not surprised
findings really interesting that, mentioned
exhalation portion primarily responsible regulation that’s actually goes
back previous endurance conversation, general rest, non-altitude
increases Co2 primary driver ventilation, generally means
inhales associated uptick sympathetic State exhales associated
uptick parasympathetic State. generally, folks will things like exhale
finish exhale right perform high Precision, neurological tasks.
going say, aim Target shoot going Exhale fully almost
always execute movement end exhale, that’s
highest parasympathetic State lowest drive ventilation. say not surprised
guys found actually data point individuals, particularly
endurance. Training can get back Baseline heart rate going
correlated with. gets actual results training. Said take
bunch individuals put endurance training program,
measure quickly can get back Baseline workout general,
folks better going see greater improvements Performance
end say, four six eight week, training block little bit
causation correlation untie. think it’s enough say: hey
invest three case study five minutes. It’s going
enhance recovery, likelihood increasing results training, now
also additional benefits like able transition appropriately next
task, going work going see family whatever thing is, it’s it’s nice close to,
asked high, sympathetic State body, asked perform
stress. gave recovery now ready transition next thing
don't take exercise energy. will next

01:03:39 Tool: Alleviate Acute Soreness, Compression Clothing



task may may not want sympathetic Drive state. somebody sore
following workout, either locally sore muscle, group group muscles, maybe
legs chest torso maybe whole body sore sometimes case.
tools can Implement order accelerate the? want call
moving soreness, it’s really, know, alleviation soreness
bunch different processes. effective tools push back
soreness dissipate yeah? Absolutely. First all, it’s not lactate! That’s just really
important thing still hear people talk about. know sore 24 hours later
got thing get lactate there, talked metabolism,
uh conversation episode not cause fatigue it’s certainly not
cause soreness. not actionable tip there, just pet peeve mine. hear
people say get irritated can maybe end conversation um strategies,
tools, can do, can actually wear compression gear will help little
bit. decent amount evidence, suggesting, just you, know, put
tighter fitting clothes Leisure, wear compression gear. can
actually prevent little bit soreness occurring. case poor
Natasha - realize just done way way much went hung
bow hunting friend trained way hard, realize, oh, goodness,
going sore here. can immediately put compression gear weigh
really long possible. examples compression gear? seen
people plane high high socks um, mean anything wear
compression gear exercise. whether just know,
compression pants leggings tight fitting leggings uh, whether long sleeve
shirt, that’s like rash guard, wear know Jiu, Jitsu surfing, something
like that. long it’s tight fitting, doesn't much can wear.
suppose get socks, great, generally just tell leads them.
put long sleeve compression shirts wear training
long, compression, leggings that'd fine. Can people apply compression
um Garb training still get positive effects yeah? not seen
evidence suggest block adaptation. may case. not aware
studies happens, certainly know information suggests can
hands little bit Muscle Recovery. ideally one knows workout
trigger lot soreness yeah compression gear sort
offset that, local muscle groups working
Reason asked socks understanding. socks uh, compression


socks people plane it’s going shift patterns blood flow, not just
lower legs, body yeah you're, probably going want focus
actual exercising tissue, though, Actually, that’s really good question. don't know
answer whether not upper body workout lower body compression
gear. actually help that’s great question. may done. don't know,
don't know answer general, just tell people like where, whole
thing much can um, actually not concerned wearing
workout. something put afterwards even wear just little bit
compression day. Um actually really fun study. Uh. collaborated
um Bill Kramer who's. Uh, know, Sports scientist Year award. bill Cramer
award, gives indication uh University Connecticut, well Lee
Brown, two Lifetime Achievement Award winners put people plane
stores, Connecticut flew Cal State Fullerton. cross-country flight
got wear compression gear flight others not,
landed California training bout put back plane, went back stores
think another training bout got back there. lot data
came paper, one things clear compression group
effective handling blood related coagulation issues associated
long flights particularly athletic performance. that’s actually sneaky little Insider trick
use lot people, particularly athletes traveling, just wear
compression gear plane. talked sort rung study
mind another effective strategy, compression gear general, well
particularly plane, basically tighter can get better, without obviously
making hands purple uncomfortable things like that, doesn't
overly tight. Anything will work probably help. also personally,
anytime, taking

01:08:27 Tool: Acute Soreness, Massage, Temperature

flight like much can just feel little better get there.
methods can use alleviate acute soreness? Well, continue
theme, saying okay, use sort pressure manipulation
enhance recovery. compression one strategy, can also use things like compression
boots garments, nomadic devices will know, pump uh air outside
compress back forth. number devices will this. can


also use physical hand, massage body work they're, really
working best. can tell mechanisms effectively moving fluid
tissue, well potentially enhancing blood flow, increasing capitalization
going get nutrients waste products out. can kind pick
choose based upon budget preferences availability timing, things like that,
effective strategies outside really next largest category, now
thermal uh, far discussion, mentioned cold water, Immersion
talked hypertrophy section not want immediately: post
exercise, getting cold water ice bath trying grow muscle
mass. said that, good evidence showing cold water immersion
specifically effective reducing muscle soreness. fair consideration it’s
classic example no free passes physiology. Nothing always good
always bad. It’s always willing give versus willing
get case like cold water immersion? may thinking yeah. might want
hypertrophic adaptations, phase training,
actually trying push towards optimization moment, rather long-term
adaptation, ice bath might great choice. addition, fall scenario
like Natasha - realize like just unbelievably sore - might cost three
four five six days training. might worth accelerate recovery
process couple days don't miss much training. it’s just it’s
algorithm, it’s equation. looking season trying compete
just done way way much exercise, really significant pain.
probably willing give small percentage eventual muscle growth
single session get pain cold strategies. Cold water immersion clearly
best approach rather cold air tactics. cold shower probably
not enough here. really want either moderately cold. maybe 40 50
degree, water probably north 15 minutes can sub 40 little maybe
five minutes get fact number studies um.
sort summarizing bunch kind one rather going Point
point. numbers just threw uh, assuming um uh Fahrenheit um,
seem seem really cold right uncomfortably cold. Absolutely always recommend
people ease protocol overall not immediately go 35 degree uh
cold water, never done uh. said, people comfortable
uncomfortable, always answer question: cold exactly?
agree very, cold much really really want get out,
able stay safely? Whatever value happens be, absolutely


need safe. said that, actually, xbt Retreats, put dozens, not
hundreds people point, uh immediately sub 35 degree water first time
ever done. know three minutes multiple rounds session, can handle it.
don't need go crazy. don't want kind play game right,
want really really cold short amount time, want like kind
cold longer amount time? really mistake can make
something like know, 65 degree water people not comfortable
know five ten minutes. It’s just not going be. It’s probably not going
effective. like man 35 is, absolutely crazy want 55 degree, water
literature area. it’s going say need probably
somewhere, almost really north 10 minutes, will actually show need
like well north 20 30 minutes. money rather go really really
cold get done five minutes, um personal preference one. can also
make little bit easier yourself. not nearly much evidence,
contrast. Stuff uh, go cold, hot sort back forth.
no really good rules terms much go, many rounds, long
cold long hot couple studies obviously
studies use numbers, doesn't mean tested See optimal,
big difference, can really just kind play feel hot good
Recovery. just careful going put blood flow
area, may walk additional acute swelling isn't going
put greater pressure there. kind play that. personally really like
hot Recovery. will feel - maybe not great moment, next day tend feel
really really good. addition, wake next morning really really hurting
super stiff, hot bath will help um quite bit, can play
protocols. Again, don't

01:14:21 Cold & Heat Contrast, Cold Shower vs. Immersion, Sauna & Fertility

nice absolutely no requirement so. just option interested
studies Dr Susanna soberg sure yeah not directly aimed alleviating soreness
recovery, increasing thermal capacity storage uh Brown adipose
tissue, not blubbery fat stuff around clavicles around heart help
generate body, heat rest metabolism on, numbers um
come not tested possible derivations just like


breathing. five minute sessions, knows? Maybe minute
equally effective. just constraints sorts studies, values
come with, seem good thresholds making sure
adaptation response triggered heat cold. ends 57 minutes per week,
total uncomfortable safe heat case sauna, can one session
breaking couple sessions day different days, 11
minutes per week. cold either one single session multiple sessions, one
um one break know multiple days one day
one. know hour sauna 11 minutes colder vice versa,
although seems little bit extreme, especially uninitiated.
numbers studied. point out, not lot really thorough
studies examining different cold protocols according temperature time requirements.
bit subjective, feel required establish routine, actually say
another time re-emphasize something. talked beginning
conversation, pain not defined outcome. It’s heavily influenced
perception, so, don't feel like work you, won't work. feel like
work fantastic, so. It’s challenging field get really objective data
always going little bit subjective nature. things, can tell
anecdotally: used hot cold contrast long time athletes. love
don't care everything between. it’s one things never
mandate it. course, can't mandate anything anyone work with, never
know like hey. interested great struggling area? want try this?
liked great struggling area, tried it. didn't love it.
Okay, fine, not find routes, will get lot ways enhance
recovery um. one hasn't even really come stopping problem
first place, not just treating symptoms, first line defense,
really need go back figure it’s happening begin with, Solution,
just different acute symptom management tactics. One final point uh,
deliberate, cold exposure. think worth mentioning one reasons shower
effective, not nearly effective cold water, immersion immersion ice
neck simply reason stated before, showers not
going get cold not going get know sub 40s. Also cold
showers haven't really studied much have, not nearly much
immersion people always ask just think challenges studying cold water
exposure shower, can't really control mango? much body
covered, whether not head stays different size bodies, Etc? Whereas


people come laboratory, can get cold large, know neck
is. know chin can make sure people's arms um legs
underneath, cold shower sure can make everyone face away toward
shower, it’s really tricky um variations described. said,
agree one wants use deliberate cold exposure, cold shower better
nothing cold immersion circulating, cold water ice bath better um
cold shower yeah? actually say looking recovery muscle soreness,
say cold shower, probably little, not going able
get enough cold water onto muscle, besides, basically head, maybe
try cold bath least get surface area coverage, yeah want
use cold shower awesome reasons cold shower. That’s totally great.
trying use recover low back glutes sore training
good way, it’s probably not going much immersion there.
actually also hit sneaky point, is, can't get water super cold, just
make water move. Jets stuff can turn anyone tried
like. Okay, can 40 degree. Bath awesome, try 60, water
moving right, break thermal layer. Normally little thin layer
water heating up. break up. It’s whole new world, yeah, absolutely
still cold. Water actually weaker way go correct can make
face stoic, make body circulate water around long
this. Maybe just one point heat uh: certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry,
sauna, steam saunas. Excuse me, jacuzzis can work pretty well yep um uh males.
looking conceive 60 days following uh uh following sauna um, hot tub realize
approaches severely limit number motile sperm um
substantially. people not trying conceive uh. Don'T think works
reliably enough, use form contraception yeah, people
trying conceive. really detrimental sperm Health right reason
people bring ice pack put groin near groin go
um, hard hot tub sauna. getting fine points,
um crude points, will pun intended, um, idea wouldn't want
anyone approach techniques compromise life goals, certainly not
allowed anywhere near things. uh, stage Life, just say
Natasha put x hanging Laird. reasons, like you're, not
going you're, not going none stuff, just wait right heat um heat


sperm relationship it’s not one that’s positive sperm


01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques

ways combine various types stimuli described inducing
recovery? talked breathing based tools which, adjust indeed
adjust oxygen carbon dioxide ratios Etc. guessing major effect
recovery going neural. It’s going deliberate, calm nervous system,
sympathetic, based uh, mentioned, yeah definitely, talked
movement based touch-based approaches. Um, will uh movement
circulate, certainly will circulate blood, also will generate contractions muscles yep
right, maybe, if, indeed again, still speculates you, indeed soreness
due excessive stretch swelling stretch, ends muscles
make sense movement touch thermal, ways combine
um effective maybe even synergistic yeah. suppose throw uh
compression garments put Pneumatic compression device sit sauna.
regulate breath like fine. Quite honestly, though,
probably don't need maximize them. joking. probably go
light swim regulating breathing cold water. get compression
cold, water good spot, certainly that. reality
is. generally look physical approach holistic approach breath
work. Basically, want breath something else knock two things
good spot, breath thermal stress, just
controlling unregulation stuff. also remember ice stressor
actually show data second actually can enhance
systemic recovery, although won't happen acute minutes. fact, it’s going
take least 30 60 minutes eventually see rebound effect, acutely it’s
going make actually sympathetic, going direction. can
opposite can actually drive up. it’s little bit dependent upon
respond, time day you're, using general, guess combining
need um, depending available. perhaps don't
sauna, can take hot bath great. Maybe percussion device
tool can use that. don't sauna amazing. don't ice bath


things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

know Bonk knee stub toe. tend grab body part try
rub totally, rubbing not coincidental thing. activates set uh touch:
sensors are, respond kind broad dull touch um actively inhibits
release inhibitory neurotransmitter, fibers control pain signal.
anytime rub know like charlie horse, leg stub toe, we,
know wince, grab tone got like squeezing little bit. That’s
actually deactivating partially inactivating pain mechanism. idea uh
swelling response trigger neural response then, recruit pain,
receptor response here, using broad, broad, brush um Strokes explain um
makes good sense

00:11:35 Muscle Spindles, Reduce Soreness

Um now, now explained process works, can actually even
add that. remember muscles work, sort
signal nervous system actually go tell muscle contract. Well
remember: episodes ago. covered physiology called
motor unit, okay. Well, didn't explain called muscle spindles
talked proprioception episode well, never tied picture
together. let walk really quickly it’s going tie Loop
nice bow. happens um? motor unit coming called
alpha motor unit that’s going innervating muscle, fibers, that’s going tell
muscle fibers contract. typically spread throughout uh. sides
muscle interior, exterior outside, though another type muscle,
called muscle spindle. Now non-contractiles, don't actin
myosin don't produce Force. responsive, proprioceptive.
means sense stretch, why, example, stretch
hamstring stretch muscle group, doesn't really matter muscle. innate
response fire back close distance, keeps say
leaning right, can imagine example give is, you're, standing
one foot, start swaying right. right, say standing right
foot, makes easier folks start swaying right like you're, going
fall right ear will hit ground. inside right, calf muscle will start
stretched. outside will start compressed right, stretch inside
right calf muscle will sense stretch will respond Contracting pulls back


middle stops falling. That’s proprioception muscle spindles sense
stretch tell contract way work gamma motor neurons,
sensory things. happening unlike tell muscle
contract. goes Alpha muscle contract. muscle spindles work oh
stretched, sends signal back Central Point, typically spinal cord,
don't actually want go way up. brain got time delay.
subconscious autonomic right versus somatic, gamma going go back
central location come back Alpha motor neurons
contract. wonderful mechanism sensing stretch going back. Well, one
Theory that’s put forward regarding muscle damage pressure actually
applied nerve endings muscle spindles, that’s actually responsible
pain signal. That’s going back coming brain registering
pain. Rather actually contractile units, muscle fibers that’s
intriguing idea, uh, suggest stretching muscles order alleviate
soreness might exact incorrect thing do. Yeah. Now, not saying that’s sure
certain just building off mechanistic logic laid here, yeah, really
laid here, effective principle based exactly that, is.
generally low level movement effective reducing acute soreness, that’s
low-level contraction muscles going anti-stretch get tissue
get fluid out. Wow you're, literally pumping cell. Yes previous
episode, talking programming, using Wii, fair
educating us, including me, um audience different structures
programming, exercise, specific adaptations Etc month week, year, scales, Etc.
brief um discussion fact one trains legs hard resistance
training, know heavy squatting dead, lifting yeah or,
soreness oftentimes quote-unquote lighter cardio um. uh low
impact work. next day number different things involve um, not high
intensity contractions muscles, require contractions muscles
can alleviate soreness quickly one Simply lie around. know.
Watch Netflix something yeah, that’s exactly right, um go back just little bit well
that’s really case um. question like: inflammatory signal coming
much learned there, little bit information right now
suggests it’s potentially coming free radicals released mitochondria
may may not hold research comes, not sure, remember
back uh conversation endurance, talked electron transport chain
aerobic metabolism regardless whether not getting energy


glycolysis carbohydrates, remember, finished aerobic
Metabolism, even lifting weights using carbs fuel,
got finish metabolism running mitochondria Performing oxidative
metabolism. result electron transport chain runs. So, theoretically, free
radicals, hyper-reactive oxygen species, basically oxygen
molecules missing electrons, react lot things,
opposite antioxidants. way, oxygen molecules extra protons,
can balance charge leak going massive,
inflammatory signal that’s probably signals cause neutrophils
macrophages kicks off entire Cascade again, believe need research
there. need look it. Maybe it’s definitive know, that’s probably
happening potentially happening rather causes Cascade Signal. Also,
combination of. Well, that’s case, not getting
tremendous amount muscle damage aerobic based exercise? Well,
don't mechanical tension pulling fibers, that’s actually causing
damage cell wall allows free radicals escape mitochondria
cell wall. that’s best. can postulate moment things
happening low level exercise tends enhance even things like
percussion, using either instruments put low level vibration leg like
pneumatic boots. can massage things generally probably helping
moving stuff demon specifically pressure comes off
nerve, endings muscle spindles, allows stop receiving signal
pain. Despite fact didn't actually regenerate tissue yet fascinating,
think beautifully frames headed next, talk different
modes recovery accelerate perhaps even combine different
forms recovery order become better recovering make faster
progress Fitness

00:18:56 Exercise, Homeostasis & Hormesis; Blood Test & Fitness Level

kick off discussion recovery understanding recovery
specific adaptations exercise actually occur. love share us
happens needs happen recovery order us get better anything,
endurance, strength, Etc, also specific types exercise, stimuli specific types
adaptations trigger running bit further. Lifting bit weight, slowing


Cadence given movement, Etc. specific types triggers adaptation relate
specific maybe similar types recovery required us make progress
one previous episodes. talking Harvard fatigue lab really
identified idea homeostasis least sort championed that’s important
levels physiology wants return homeostasis. happens terms
adaptation? challenged level realizes? not make change,
will not able get back level homeostasis. That’s fundamentally
happening. recovery, process taking insult temporarily reduced
functionality, causing change now come back get often call
support performance super compensation. really doing, though, bringing
new level homeostasis effectively. understanding insult comes again.
need able make sure doesn't cause level disruption,
raise bar whether enhancing ability take level mechanical
tension muscle not result micro damage. Whether able take
reduction energy not compromise sleep anything, it’s really
fundamentally changing. can new level homeostasis, it’s
presuming it’s predicting insult going come road.
wanted clarify people Dr Galvin says insult may actually insult me,
um insult nerd speak terminology sort damage inflicted tissue
system. um speaking insult muscle insult neuromuscular
connection, created adding weight bar running distance um running
bit fast pedaling faster. creates micro insult insult. now,
everyone familiar um, psychological verbal insults, never forget
biological concept, it’s important. tag another thing here, called hormesis. It’s
one favorite phenomenon, effectively means dosage
toxicity, responds almost everything. think context say
drugs, means is, gave 10 milligrams something okay,
give 20 it'd problem eventually, go give enough, thing
turns toxic: case everything cyanide, can actually small
dosages nature. fact, it’s many fruits eat, it’s not dosage,
doesn't matter dosage gets higher, though actually can cause problems,
high enough, can actually kill instantaneously. back end that, though,
introduce micro insult framed perfectly, body will
adapt it, that’s really happening exercise adaptation is, hormetic
stressor that’s important is, look immediate responses exercise
see extremely large increase inflammation, see, oxidative stress, see whole


Cascade autophagy, like problems quote unquote happening. It’s actually
quite funny. is, part PhD, academic portion. go
medical side school, physiology class med school,
non-medical doctor class right, PhD. leave lab. walk across
campus take physiology class folks died whole time internally,
every time cover new area, basically exact value
number medical setting like. Oh, gosh they're, going die performance
setting like person's fantastic shape. I've? Never still amuses day,
obviously, it’s just simple things like total blood volume right cover like
okay, patient come blood volume six liters, know can
immediately get diuretic sort going heart attack
blood pressure gets right now, immediately thinking damn six leaders
person super fit actually positive adaptation training it’s one
important, not important Adaptation endurance training enhance, total
blood volume, store blood body fit less
fit. mean go things. Sodium concentrations - potassium
concentrations like look things paper don't know person
die 65 years old shape person going break
world record marathon. brings important tangent, uh,
instance, go take blood test - somebody exercises
intensely uh resistance training, blood creatinine levels can way range,
physician doesn't know certain forms exercise might say:
wow, lot muscle tissue damage occurring body yeah, mentioned
before, total blood volume is, dangerously High, fact, far healthier
need much fitter person who, numbers range, said,
obviously um limits statements, whereby want
cautious take action ameliorate, elevated blood, creatinine level something
sort. point bringing also one field medicine,
many, not all, many Physicians don't take consideration uh outside
activities people doing, becomes kind plug-and-play type, um type
Way looking blood charts, yeah done many thousand athletes, blood chemistry
uh. don't use. First all, never look disease stuff, that’s not do.
take people healthy try optimize performance blood. Chemistry one
best tools. really understand there, can get
incredibly powerful information blood chemistry actually relates
going talk today terms measuring everything acute Chronic dehydration


sleep, deprivation can identified blood Chemistry optimization improvements
nutrition, supplementation lot can get there. people interested field,
Point gentleman named Dan Garner. just absolute Juggernaut
wizard blood chemistry high performance, well can get ton information
that. understand difference exactly talked about. Looking
signals increased risk cardiovascular events, 25 years road versus, this:
optimal value high performance athlete, database
software stuff does, looking things. going talk
biomarkers look little

00:30:20 Recovery Timescales, Adaptation & Optimization

Bit later salivary blood stuff, maybe save part conversation
road. Tell different time scales recovery. Sure actually
trying answer question got way off track, reason
brought Hermetic thing is: understand things acute say, 24
40 hour period, look terrible. It’s actually fine right, stimuli, that’s causing
adaptation. reason brought medical exchange you,
looked inflammatory markers mentioned them, see
highest acute within seconds minutes hours exercise. However, that’s
exactly stimuli needed bring chronically, okay chronically meaning.
Maybe moment elevated maybe coming 24 hours later
48 hours. However, compare resting level say Monday,
worked resting level, Monday week following week following that,
probably see Baseline inflammation goes down, got
really careful. talking immediately post-exercise man, markers look terrible?
Maybe recovery score awful, Etc. That’s not necessarily bad thing,
like looking not change happening today, trying
cause adaptation may take us weeks months actually access. love
highlighting principle, one obvious ones now said
heart rate. Absolutely. heart rate goes very, high exercise,
fairly consistently even semi-consistently. resting heart rate will actually quite bit
lower. That’s fantastic example! Really getting concept,
think it’s important differentiate adaptation optimization. Now hear
word use scientists hate it, it’s good communication tool, optimization


optimizing current moment, almost surely compromising late
adaptation right. If, say, thing right now makes feel absolute
best world like great, took nap donut like awesome,
feel amazing, know it’s causing long-term issues. can said
back end, never choosing things make better right now, never
actually going see adaptation. really recovery
conversation playing game balancing immediate gratification leg
gratification, identify much now versus not? use value
marker? Whether tired feel today, sore today versus score
app tracking metric, blood marker, anything understand. that’s
need cause adaptation, want week month, three months now
case athletes, it’s even four years right, trying cause
adaptations will get us want get Olympics World Championships
World Cup, wherever going that’s framework, think
recovery. maybe falsely think need maximize recovery today
something like taken anti-inflammatory, whether supplementation
drug, maybe ice. Oh cool, that’s great! will enhance recovery
moment. That'Ll make feel better today, probably tomorrow, know
blocks signal adaptation, not going get results. know four
six, eight weeks now. talk recovery, understand tool
am. using order that, understand training
trying maximize middle season athlete
competing tomorrow, going head towards Acute recovery right
actuate performance right now, starting off season, not hedging towards
recovery, actually hedging towards adaptation, not going deploy these,
especially things like evidence combination vitamin C vitamin E will
blunt hypertrophic adaptations anti-inflammatory antioxidants right
Studies shown? Maybe don't uh inhibitory fact may may not
point conceptually. want careful trying optimize for,
forethought alone going dictate decision making
whether not get eyes uh now will cover tools, Like
massage pretty fine use, don't worry blocking

00:35:10 Adaptation & Biomarkers Levels



Long-Term adaptation, others going want careful
principle laid us, set events occur
exercise trigger adaptation sets motion number adaptations
occur recovery give us exact opposite response trigger
go back heart rate example: um heart rate close maximal maximal.
enough times within short know week two weeks resting
heart rate goes down. recall episodes ago, said maximum heart rate
doesn't really change. much. correct? Yes, okay, resting heart rate can
go quite bit yep. general theme meaning less set
upper limit ceiling things like inflammatory markers heart rate, maybe even things
like stress deliberately trigger stress dramatic increase
heart rate dramatic Increase inflammatory markers lowering floor,
ceiling Remains Same. It’s dependent upon marker, case
maximum heart rate, will not change exception one thing age, brings
down. Training will not change circumstances. look something like
inflammatory response, suppose, theoretically, ceiling, though not aware
um. can tell right now, looking blood markers, things like creatine kinase,
remember conversation metabolism use phosphocreatine
one primary fuel sources explosive exercise. Well, using phosphocreatine
creatine kinase, remember, kinase enzymes function break things
part, creatine kinase enzyme use break creatine
that. lot, creatine kinase gets muscle seeps blood
myoglobin actually another fantastic marker. way, myoglobin is, think
hemoglobin blood, molecule carries oxygen around it’s
muscle tissue. it’s myoglobin mild, meaning muscle it’s globulin thing.
bunch markers can look muscle breakdown one things
can see creatine kinase level. That’s elevated say, um, one bout exercise and,
might, might up. know five six-fold. actually seen number
offensive lineman NFL, something like 500 plus fold, even within just one
category next. number can get extraordinarily high know actually
one important Point here, paying attention mechanistic research
use you're, using inform decision making, extraordinarily careful
magnitude Mean is, running western blot looking
signaling protein um muscle uh activation protein turn mitochondrial
biogenesis, saw whatever intervention gave it, whether nutrition thing
drug exercise - saw signaling protein increased 20 percent.


basically assume totally physiologically irrelevant, order
important, totally depends market looking at, markers
might need see four five six hundred fold increase before. know will actually
enough call physiologically relevant others one two percent
relevant, really want careful either reading papers
looking Social Media stuff. people just talking this, marker increase much,
may not matter, may totally irrelevant physiologically,
also, wondering like hell are, people. Well, that’s can
trick little bit intentionally not. just trying best,
don't really understand area enough, that’s important point pay attention to.
So. answer question fully, hard determine truly
maximum level um. things don't want move like blood pH. doesn't really want
move range going move from, know like 6.8 7.4, get
like 7.9, like you're, probably big big big trouble, things can go 500 5 000
fold, markers will really determine answer well point future.
love continue discussion around topic stress, specifically yeah um,
maybe will get little bit later today um get use deliberate
cold exposure, that’s certainly um effects related directly temperature
tissue. certainly mental effects terms raising one's level perceived pain. It’s
fun um, people love people love feeling get it.
Um deliberate cold exposure. people like feeling get not
unlike exercise totally. love train. love exercise, know many people uh um.
loathe exercise, love feeling afterward. will theme will
come back to. Thank indulging interest

00:40:36 4 Recovery Levels, Enhance Recovery

semi-tangent, think it’s relevant tangent thing, can now return
us different time, scales, yeah modes recovery, think
headed get better recovery. Yep. talk tools, talk
measure identify four distinct levels, level one call
overload just quickly means is. workout today. sign
symptom overload fatigued. Acute performance down, worked hard right
now. go, try maximum effort, reduced ability.
recovery period acute overload minutes days right. That’s generally, call


acute overload that’s looking right. systems theoretically
see hormetic stressor come back response, come back, bigger, better, efficient,
Etc. continue training state, like us, say workout
today, little bit acute overload going work tomorrow. little acute
overload can work next day little acute overload. Even took day
it’s doesn't matter right, just continue acute bouts insult
going pushing absolute golden Target, call functional
overreaching. reached can currently results
functional outcome, mean functionally performance enhanced
performance whatever deem stronger, you've, enhanced
muscle size, mitochondria improved you've, whatever thing is, it’s not just
physical performance thing right, amazing, recovery time functional overreaching
typically days maybe even week so, typically, see happen
prior competition. Individuals will call taper, reduced training
volume short period time, reason do. again.
Actualize phrase year adaptations, worked hard six
weeks know, theoretically, workouts. three four five six weeks ago,
allow, system recover will actualized, means performance will
enhanced. functional overreaching golden Target. Okay,
point functional overreaching - continue train intensified whether
intensity volume really. said earlier, something
holding back recovery. doesn't really matter right. It’s it’s sort two sides
coin. move call non-functional overreaching
reached again, now non-functional not see positive benefit
recovery allowed. typically means weeks takes weeks come back from,
basically just get back Baseline, lot folks end
vicious cycle, like man, not getting results. want. going train
harder, not getting results. want going train harder harder,
caught recovery isn't improved, just end spot. train
end spot end up. just either blowing quitting
not getting want. continue past point, may
actually actually call training typically, considered
trained takes months recover people think trained really
not you're. Just probably non-functionally overreached classic distinction is,
took three four days off felt better, weren't, probably quote unquote
trained. probably just area non-functional reaching. need little bit


back off - case. happen gymnasts
cheerleader things take month off barely seeing
start come back Baseline numbers. number areas, mood desire
train testosterone, cortisol ratios biomarkers number areas - physical performance,
vertical jump height, like things just start get back Baseline, true
training actually quite rare. Non-Functional overreaching much common
shorter time frame scale. talk recovery, four pieces
really thinking about, so, concerned about, oh super sore.
get less sore? either not sore next time? workout
super sorry. Now. recover playing first category overload
can certainly talk figure out. quick answer got go back
previous episodes just pay attention volume intensity recommendations
getting significantly uh damage fatigue workout? probably
increased volume quickly, something else dragging stress bucket down,
generally, problem training. Um either didn't warm sufficiently.
fueling strategy off talk Next Episode violated. One
principles increasing intensity volume sort quickly, it’s past
getting stage you're, just like feeling beat time energy going
down, just not feeling like recovered. Now overreaching stage,
story kind tell always years ago working wife Natasha
garage training something like comes stumbling
look Eyes like eyeballs, giant she's, just like wobbling she's.
Like effed up, like mean like effed she's? Just like, read
program wrong like Trump like what'd. like supposed
10 sets three every minute minute three sets ten every minute
minute absolutely wrecked. couldn't move hours afterwards
days, she's. Just like handle kids like, can't get bed.
can't move like classic example right like don't need fix recovery
here, you're, just dummy, dream way hard long like not
don't problem here. it’s situation like that, it’s generally just program
way off. it’s constantly happening you're, just like man like whatever reason,
every while, getting really sore really bad performance
workouts, need go stress bucket. Take look allostatic load
allostasis get figured happening um.




00:48:19 Overreaching vs. Overtraining

happy pointed distinction functional overreaching, training
trained. think one one common mistake people make thinking
biology generally think terms nouns adjectives not verbs amazing.
love much know, biology collection processes processes depending
live, trained trained state that,
many ways, adjective trained trained. It’s like saying, uh,
know American, know Czechoslovakian whatever happens, right
many ways people start associate identity, least transient identity,
start making sorts decisions. sounds like sorts verbs will
will not engage in, whereas think look things processes assign verbs
them, can say: okay, functionally overreaching truly training,
matter Degrees, correct right training matter, not reaching,
not functionally reaching it’s just it’s just performance, know, just
nervous system, won't change unless give reason reason why,
can Perform something perfectly speak language perfectly. no rewiring
nervous system. myth told every experience rewires
nervous system, it’s different now two seconds ago. That’s that’s ridiculous,
illogical statement. know. That’s not true nervous system can perform something,
no reason change won't muscles way.
progressively overload learn something new challenge muscle
something new, it’s thing. example gave uh wife
workout turned far strenuous, functionally overreach.
sense, might training heading direction training,
mistake assume trained right, kind it’s almost becomes
bit state character assignment um, opposed verb, case,
no perfect way describe - talking nouns adjectives also
um talking verbs. think verbs really anchored processes
things actions can take um. may, like just highlight this,
idea shifting one sinking towards verb actions rather labels state
happen person happen right. Sometimes even become
kind character. Logical way people describe uh, believe
something called training training real words,
don't ever really know trained, nailed it. there's. No, know it’s
not like red flag. Uh, know shoots shoulder say trained.


know it’s um, so, hope can start thinking verbs,
actions can take order ensure stimulate Progressive, overload
one way another time, don't fall bins character
assignment suddenly decide need X like take month off
something like that, beginning realize um discussion that’s
exactly wrong way go. fantastic points want make sure clear
no clinical diagnosis training. no standards, no test
blood panel. can pull. actually identify state.
distinction Here, Andrew verbs, rather nouns is, wonderful
exactly case. way really come retroactively, diagnose
one training is, had. weeks recovery got back
Baseline, can't moment. can't take single test, no subjective
marker anything says trained. simply, probably training,
need reverse quickly case step probably non-
functionally overreaching. continue this, will probably enter new stage
training need come back. that’s important thing
let people know no one thing actually point says

00:52:53 Tool: Acute Overload & Recovery, Breathwork

not noun, verb. tools can use
enhance recovery yep? start off acute overload phase. So, words,
just workout feeling awful just one two days ago super sore.
get rid right now? Well, couple things can immediately
workout others maybe actionable day later two days
later just cover handful them. nutrition hydration
supplementation next episode. going cover everything else, not category
right now, couple things number one. can actually start Kickstart recovery
process end current training session, guess say way.
strongly suggest start recovery process immediately workout
mentioned earlier idea got get really high peak stress cause
adaptation, actually didn't explain correctly, happen
need extremely High peak, met extremely sharp
recovery back down, know talked
neuroplasticity stuff terms happen caused insult.


immediately need able recover make sure causes changes brains
thing happens here. need really sharp high inflammatory response
then, not meet immediate recovery period, signal won't
maximize results. mean can actually couple things? Number
one actually listening slow, paced, music evidence suggest fast-paced music
may slow recovery slow pace actually enhance it. just change
know maximum get get going music workout
slower, lower Cadence will help kick start idea similar note. can also
use call regulation breathing. conjunction one
other, whichever you, personal favorite method somewhere
three ten minutes finishing training session. Laying like
position, certainly Lotus position, think laying back
generally effective personal preference there, no science, like items
covered getting dark quiet sort area Then, just breathing nose
structured, Cadence, lot different things. can try easy example. just
box breathing can imagine box four squares. going
inhale somewhere between, like three eight seconds whatever number
choose, keep tempo, say chose five second inhale,
that’s going take vertically horizontally box five second hold
five second exhale five second hold, just need repeat
time domain. Now typically honestly don't use timer you'll, actually notice. lot
people will like fall asleep get really close falling asleep period. can
triangle version that, inhale, hold exhale go right back
inhale bunch different tricks. can try here, need play around
see actually works best you. Um 10 minutes probably better, can just
least give three that'll work, really really resistant, can actually that. Just
shower, going finish workout get shower again, just close
eyes shower, give three minutes focused relaxation breathing will
accelerate recovery process. love particularly love laboratory
works stress respiration, okay, breathing interactions two
just mention result just accepted publication, time day.
uh. Thank you. Uh beautiful work uh, not directly, although took
place lab, know, it’s students doctors um, Dr Melise uh, balbon
uh lab. It’s phenomenal researcher showed short period five minutes
box breathing exactly type described cyclic sign two inhales, followed
extended exhale lungs empty. Ideally, inhales done nose.


exhales done. Uh mouth, although done nose, um
mouth matter, probably nose. Nose inhale, inhale mouth exhale
um uh inhales, nose exhale nose. Cyclic sighing,
refer done five minutes, produce significant decreases resting
heart rate. time will increase things like heart rate, variability
forth. Um provided extended exhales. seems like calming response,
reduction overall stress occurs. thing really sends things
direction something like cyclic hyperventilation. sure observed um
interestingly uh, people just five minutes meditation which,
which, course, breathing just allowing breathing progress.
However, happens moment, um moments across five minutes uh.
reductions sorts markers stress described not significant
breathing. love Brock's breathing tool, post, workout, um
Alternatives too, just mentioned, think people greatly underestimate
potency breathing shifting one's nervous system function away stress one
wants toward alertness stress. actually couple questions
sure. think audience appreciate uh. long boxes? just
user selected great question, use carbon dioxide tolerance test amazing order
people determine long different sides Box be, cover
carbon dioxide tolerance tests. previous episode, can provide link clip um
show, note captions, but, point out, involves long extended exhale lungs,
empty um and, course, people sit lungs empty, accurately
Faithfully say report long took empty lungs. use
gauge. Typically, takes, people go lungs empty 20 seconds less, believe
go back paper look, believe duration sides
boxes were, somewhere um two three seconds,
CO2 discard time anywhere uh 20 seconds 40 45 seconds, use it.
sides box, believe, four six seconds people
longer discard Arrow period minute more. used
box duration inhale, hold exhale, hold duration somewhere between. believe
[ Music, ], um, seven, maybe eight long 11 12 seconds yeah.
will get kind free diver types. can really this? really well
trained sort thing? don't quote exactly numbers,
approximate. line exactly done. believe it’s it’s going
close within seconds non-important Distinction. it’s going close enough,
that’s great, uh. took six weeks. study done


period month swapped new pattern breathing um,
condition meditation condition - done natural world, say, um
wearing whoop bands. getting heart rate, heart rate, variability, sleep,
data, subjective data mood Etc. lot measures, um
100 subjects wild life um tried best track life, stress
events exercise, things like harder control outside laboratory.
Really results speak exactly exactly describing here,
deliberate respiration involves controlled holds exhales really dramatic
immediate impact reducing levels stress. That’s wonderful! not surprised
findings really interesting that, mentioned
exhalation portion primarily responsible regulation that’s actually goes
back previous endurance conversation, general rest, non-altitude
increases Co2 primary driver ventilation, generally means
inhales associated uptick sympathetic State exhales associated
uptick parasympathetic State. generally, folks will things like exhale
finish exhale right perform high Precision, neurological tasks.
going say, aim Target shoot going Exhale fully almost
always execute movement end exhale, that’s
highest parasympathetic State lowest drive ventilation. say not surprised
guys found actually data point individuals, particularly
endurance. Training can get back Baseline heart rate going
correlated with. gets actual results training. Said take
bunch individuals put endurance training program,
measure quickly can get back Baseline workout general,
folks better going see greater improvements Performance
end say, four six eight week, training block little bit
causation correlation untie. think it’s enough say: hey
invest three case study five minutes. It’s going
enhance recovery, likelihood increasing results training, now
also additional benefits like able transition appropriately next
task, going work going see family whatever thing is, it’s it’s nice close to,
asked high, sympathetic State body, asked perform
stress. gave recovery now ready transition next thing
don't take exercise energy. will next

01:03:39 Tool: Alleviate Acute Soreness, Compression Clothing



task may may not want sympathetic Drive state. somebody sore
following workout, either locally sore muscle, group group muscles, maybe
legs chest torso maybe whole body sore sometimes case.
tools can Implement order accelerate the? want call
moving soreness, it’s really, know, alleviation soreness
bunch different processes. effective tools push back
soreness dissipate yeah? Absolutely. First all, it’s not lactate! That’s just really
important thing still hear people talk about. know sore 24 hours later
got thing get lactate there, talked metabolism,
uh conversation episode not cause fatigue it’s certainly not
cause soreness. not actionable tip there, just pet peeve mine. hear
people say get irritated can maybe end conversation um strategies,
tools, can do, can actually wear compression gear will help little
bit. decent amount evidence, suggesting, just you, know, put
tighter fitting clothes Leisure, wear compression gear. can
actually prevent little bit soreness occurring. case poor
Natasha - realize just done way way much went hung
bow hunting friend trained way hard, realize, oh, goodness,
going sore here. can immediately put compression gear weigh
really long possible. examples compression gear? seen
people plane high high socks um, mean anything wear
compression gear exercise. whether just know,
compression pants leggings tight fitting leggings uh, whether long sleeve
shirt, that’s like rash guard, wear know Jiu, Jitsu surfing, something
like that. long it’s tight fitting, doesn't much can wear.
suppose get socks, great, generally just tell leads them.
put long sleeve compression shirts wear training
long, compression, leggings that'd fine. Can people apply compression
um Garb training still get positive effects yeah? not seen
evidence suggest block adaptation. may case. not aware
studies happens, certainly know information suggests can
hands little bit Muscle Recovery. ideally one knows workout
trigger lot soreness yeah compression gear sort
offset that, local muscle groups working
Reason asked socks understanding. socks uh, compression


socks people plane it’s going shift patterns blood flow, not just
lower legs, body yeah you're, probably going want focus
actual exercising tissue, though, Actually, that’s really good question. don't know
answer whether not upper body workout lower body compression
gear. actually help that’s great question. may done. don't know,
don't know answer general, just tell people like where, whole
thing much can um, actually not concerned wearing
workout. something put afterwards even wear just little bit
compression day. Um actually really fun study. Uh. collaborated
um Bill Kramer who's. Uh, know, Sports scientist Year award. bill Cramer
award, gives indication uh University Connecticut, well Lee
Brown, two Lifetime Achievement Award winners put people plane
stores, Connecticut flew Cal State Fullerton. cross-country flight
got wear compression gear flight others not,
landed California training bout put back plane, went back stores
think another training bout got back there. lot data
came paper, one things clear compression group
effective handling blood related coagulation issues associated
long flights particularly athletic performance. that’s actually sneaky little Insider trick
use lot people, particularly athletes traveling, just wear
compression gear plane. talked sort rung study
mind another effective strategy, compression gear general, well
particularly plane, basically tighter can get better, without obviously
making hands purple uncomfortable things like that, doesn't
overly tight. Anything will work probably help. also personally,
anytime, taking

01:08:27 Tool: Acute Soreness, Massage, Temperature

flight like much can just feel little better get there.
methods can use alleviate acute soreness? Well, continue
theme, saying okay, use sort pressure manipulation
enhance recovery. compression one strategy, can also use things like compression
boots garments, nomadic devices will know, pump uh air outside
compress back forth. number devices will this. can


also use physical hand, massage body work they're, really
working best. can tell mechanisms effectively moving fluid
tissue, well potentially enhancing blood flow, increasing capitalization
going get nutrients waste products out. can kind pick
choose based upon budget preferences availability timing, things like that,
effective strategies outside really next largest category, now
thermal uh, far discussion, mentioned cold water, Immersion
talked hypertrophy section not want immediately: post
exercise, getting cold water ice bath trying grow muscle
mass. said that, good evidence showing cold water immersion
specifically effective reducing muscle soreness. fair consideration it’s
classic example no free passes physiology. Nothing always good
always bad. It’s always willing give versus willing
get case like cold water immersion? may thinking yeah. might want
hypertrophic adaptations, phase training,
actually trying push towards optimization moment, rather long-term
adaptation, ice bath might great choice. addition, fall scenario
like Natasha - realize like just unbelievably sore - might cost three
four five six days training. might worth accelerate recovery
process couple days don't miss much training. it’s just it’s
algorithm, it’s equation. looking season trying compete
just done way way much exercise, really significant pain.
probably willing give small percentage eventual muscle growth
single session get pain cold strategies. Cold water immersion clearly
best approach rather cold air tactics. cold shower probably
not enough here. really want either moderately cold. maybe 40 50
degree, water probably north 15 minutes can sub 40 little maybe
five minutes get fact number studies um.
sort summarizing bunch kind one rather going Point
point. numbers just threw uh, assuming um uh Fahrenheit um,
seem seem really cold right uncomfortably cold. Absolutely always recommend
people ease protocol overall not immediately go 35 degree uh
cold water, never done uh. said, people comfortable
uncomfortable, always answer question: cold exactly?
agree very, cold much really really want get out,
able stay safely? Whatever value happens be, absolutely


need safe. said that, actually, xbt Retreats, put dozens, not
hundreds people point, uh immediately sub 35 degree water first time
ever done. know three minutes multiple rounds session, can handle it.
don't need go crazy. don't want kind play game right,
want really really cold short amount time, want like kind
cold longer amount time? really mistake can make
something like know, 65 degree water people not comfortable
know five ten minutes. It’s just not going be. It’s probably not going
effective. like man 35 is, absolutely crazy want 55 degree, water
literature area. it’s going say need probably
somewhere, almost really north 10 minutes, will actually show need
like well north 20 30 minutes. money rather go really really
cold get done five minutes, um personal preference one. can also
make little bit easier yourself. not nearly much evidence,
contrast. Stuff uh, go cold, hot sort back forth.
no really good rules terms much go, many rounds, long
cold long hot couple studies obviously
studies use numbers, doesn't mean tested See optimal,
big difference, can really just kind play feel hot good
Recovery. just careful going put blood flow
area, may walk additional acute swelling isn't going
put greater pressure there. kind play that. personally really like
hot Recovery. will feel - maybe not great moment, next day tend feel
really really good. addition, wake next morning really really hurting
super stiff, hot bath will help um quite bit, can play
protocols. Again, don't

01:14:21 Cold & Heat Contrast, Cold Shower vs. Immersion, Sauna & Fertility

nice absolutely no requirement so. just option interested
studies Dr Susanna soberg sure yeah not directly aimed alleviating soreness
recovery, increasing thermal capacity storage uh Brown adipose
tissue, not blubbery fat stuff around clavicles around heart help
generate body, heat rest metabolism on, numbers um
come not tested possible derivations just like


breathing. five minute sessions, knows? Maybe minute
equally effective. just constraints sorts studies, values
come with, seem good thresholds making sure
adaptation response triggered heat cold. ends 57 minutes per week,
total uncomfortable safe heat case sauna, can one session
breaking couple sessions day different days, 11
minutes per week. cold either one single session multiple sessions, one
um one break know multiple days one day
one. know hour sauna 11 minutes colder vice versa,
although seems little bit extreme, especially uninitiated.
numbers studied. point out, not lot really thorough
studies examining different cold protocols according temperature time requirements.
bit subjective, feel required establish routine, actually say
another time re-emphasize something. talked beginning
conversation, pain not defined outcome. It’s heavily influenced
perception, so, don't feel like work you, won't work. feel like
work fantastic, so. It’s challenging field get really objective data
always going little bit subjective nature. things, can tell
anecdotally: used hot cold contrast long time athletes. love
don't care everything between. it’s one things never
mandate it. course, can't mandate anything anyone work with, never
know like hey. interested great struggling area? want try this?
liked great struggling area, tried it. didn't love it.
Okay, fine, not find routes, will get lot ways enhance
recovery um. one hasn't even really come stopping problem
first place, not just treating symptoms, first line defense,
really need go back figure it’s happening begin with, Solution,
just different acute symptom management tactics. One final point uh,
deliberate, cold exposure. think worth mentioning one reasons shower
effective, not nearly effective cold water, immersion immersion ice
neck simply reason stated before, showers not
going get cold not going get know sub 40s. Also cold
showers haven't really studied much have, not nearly much
immersion people always ask just think challenges studying cold water
exposure shower, can't really control mango? much body
covered, whether not head stays different size bodies, Etc? Whereas


people come laboratory, can get cold large, know neck
is. know chin can make sure people's arms um legs
underneath, cold shower sure can make everyone face away toward
shower, it’s really tricky um variations described. said,
agree one wants use deliberate cold exposure, cold shower better
nothing cold immersion circulating, cold water ice bath better um
cold shower yeah? actually say looking recovery muscle soreness,
say cold shower, probably little, not going able
get enough cold water onto muscle, besides, basically head, maybe
try cold bath least get surface area coverage, yeah want
use cold shower awesome reasons cold shower. That’s totally great.
trying use recover low back glutes sore training
good way, it’s probably not going much immersion there.
actually also hit sneaky point, is, can't get water super cold, just
make water move. Jets stuff can turn anyone tried
like. Okay, can 40 degree. Bath awesome, try 60, water
moving right, break thermal layer. Normally little thin layer
water heating up. break up. It’s whole new world, yeah, absolutely
still cold. Water actually weaker way go correct can make
face stoic, make body circulate water around long
this. Maybe just one point heat uh: certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry,
sauna, steam saunas. Excuse me, jacuzzis can work pretty well yep um uh males.
looking conceive 60 days following uh uh following sauna um, hot tub realize
approaches severely limit number motile sperm um
substantially. people not trying conceive uh. Don'T think works
reliably enough, use form contraception yeah, people
trying conceive. really detrimental sperm Health right reason
people bring ice pack put groin near groin go
um, hard hot tub sauna. getting fine points,
um crude points, will pun intended, um, idea wouldn't want
anyone approach techniques compromise life goals, certainly not
allowed anywhere near things. uh, stage Life, just say
Natasha put x hanging Laird. reasons, like you're, not
going you're, not going none stuff, just wait right heat um heat


sperm relationship it’s not one that’s positive sperm


01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques

ways combine various types stimuli described inducing
recovery? talked breathing based tools which, adjust indeed
adjust oxygen carbon dioxide ratios Etc. guessing major effect
recovery going neural. It’s going deliberate, calm nervous system,
sympathetic, based uh, mentioned, yeah definitely, talked
movement based touch-based approaches. Um, will uh movement
circulate, certainly will circulate blood, also will generate contractions muscles yep
right, maybe, if, indeed again, still speculates you, indeed soreness
due excessive stretch swelling stretch, ends muscles
make sense movement touch thermal, ways combine
um effective maybe even synergistic yeah. suppose throw uh
compression garments put Pneumatic compression device sit sauna.
regulate breath like fine. Quite honestly, though,
probably don't need maximize them. joking. probably go
light swim regulating breathing cold water. get compression
cold, water good spot, certainly that. reality
is. generally look physical approach holistic approach breath
work. Basically, want breath something else knock two things
good spot, breath thermal stress, just
controlling unregulation stuff. also remember ice stressor
actually show data second actually can enhance
systemic recovery, although won't happen acute minutes. fact, it’s going
take least 30 60 minutes eventually see rebound effect, acutely it’s
going make actually sympathetic, going direction. can
opposite can actually drive up. it’s little bit dependent upon
respond, time day you're, using general, guess combining
need um, depending available. perhaps don't
sauna, can take hot bath great. Maybe percussion device
tool can use that. don't sauna amazing. don't ice bath


things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

middle stops falling. That’s proprioception muscle spindles sense
stretch tell contract way work gamma motor neurons,
sensory things. happening unlike tell muscle
contract. goes Alpha muscle contract. muscle spindles work oh
stretched, sends signal back Central Point, typically spinal cord,
don't actually want go way up. brain got time delay.
subconscious autonomic right versus somatic, gamma going go back
central location come back Alpha motor neurons
contract. wonderful mechanism sensing stretch going back. Well, one
Theory that’s put forward regarding muscle damage pressure actually
applied nerve endings muscle spindles, that’s actually responsible
pain signal. That’s going back coming brain registering
pain. Rather actually contractile units, muscle fibers that’s
intriguing idea, uh, suggest stretching muscles order alleviate
soreness might exact incorrect thing do. Yeah. Now, not saying that’s sure
certain just building off mechanistic logic laid here, yeah, really
laid here, effective principle based exactly that, is.
generally low level movement effective reducing acute soreness, that’s
low-level contraction muscles going anti-stretch get tissue
get fluid out. Wow you're, literally pumping cell. Yes previous
episode, talking programming, using Wii, fair
educating us, including me, um audience different structures
programming, exercise, specific adaptations Etc month week, year, scales, Etc.
brief um discussion fact one trains legs hard resistance
training, know heavy squatting dead, lifting yeah or,
soreness oftentimes quote-unquote lighter cardio um. uh low
impact work. next day number different things involve um, not high
intensity contractions muscles, require contractions muscles
can alleviate soreness quickly one Simply lie around. know.
Watch Netflix something yeah, that’s exactly right, um go back just little bit well
that’s really case um. question like: inflammatory signal coming
much learned there, little bit information right now
suggests it’s potentially coming free radicals released mitochondria
may may not hold research comes, not sure, remember
back uh conversation endurance, talked electron transport chain
aerobic metabolism regardless whether not getting energy


glycolysis carbohydrates, remember, finished aerobic
Metabolism, even lifting weights using carbs fuel,
got finish metabolism running mitochondria Performing oxidative
metabolism. result electron transport chain runs. So, theoretically, free
radicals, hyper-reactive oxygen species, basically oxygen
molecules missing electrons, react lot things,
opposite antioxidants. way, oxygen molecules extra protons,
can balance charge leak going massive,
inflammatory signal that’s probably signals cause neutrophils
macrophages kicks off entire Cascade again, believe need research
there. need look it. Maybe it’s definitive know, that’s probably
happening potentially happening rather causes Cascade Signal. Also,
combination of. Well, that’s case, not getting
tremendous amount muscle damage aerobic based exercise? Well,
don't mechanical tension pulling fibers, that’s actually causing
damage cell wall allows free radicals escape mitochondria
cell wall. that’s best. can postulate moment things
happening low level exercise tends enhance even things like
percussion, using either instruments put low level vibration leg like
pneumatic boots. can massage things generally probably helping
moving stuff demon specifically pressure comes off
nerve, endings muscle spindles, allows stop receiving signal
pain. Despite fact didn't actually regenerate tissue yet fascinating,
think beautifully frames headed next, talk different
modes recovery accelerate perhaps even combine different
forms recovery order become better recovering make faster
progress Fitness

00:18:56 Exercise, Homeostasis & Hormesis; Blood Test & Fitness Level

kick off discussion recovery understanding recovery
specific adaptations exercise actually occur. love share us
happens needs happen recovery order us get better anything,
endurance, strength, Etc, also specific types exercise, stimuli specific types
adaptations trigger running bit further. Lifting bit weight, slowing


Cadence given movement, Etc. specific types triggers adaptation relate
specific maybe similar types recovery required us make progress
one previous episodes. talking Harvard fatigue lab really
identified idea homeostasis least sort championed that’s important
levels physiology wants return homeostasis. happens terms
adaptation? challenged level realizes? not make change,
will not able get back level homeostasis. That’s fundamentally
happening. recovery, process taking insult temporarily reduced
functionality, causing change now come back get often call
support performance super compensation. really doing, though, bringing
new level homeostasis effectively. understanding insult comes again.
need able make sure doesn't cause level disruption,
raise bar whether enhancing ability take level mechanical
tension muscle not result micro damage. Whether able take
reduction energy not compromise sleep anything, it’s really
fundamentally changing. can new level homeostasis, it’s
presuming it’s predicting insult going come road.
wanted clarify people Dr Galvin says insult may actually insult me,
um insult nerd speak terminology sort damage inflicted tissue
system. um speaking insult muscle insult neuromuscular
connection, created adding weight bar running distance um running
bit fast pedaling faster. creates micro insult insult. now,
everyone familiar um, psychological verbal insults, never forget
biological concept, it’s important. tag another thing here, called hormesis. It’s
one favorite phenomenon, effectively means dosage
toxicity, responds almost everything. think context say
drugs, means is, gave 10 milligrams something okay,
give 20 it'd problem eventually, go give enough, thing
turns toxic: case everything cyanide, can actually small
dosages nature. fact, it’s many fruits eat, it’s not dosage,
doesn't matter dosage gets higher, though actually can cause problems,
high enough, can actually kill instantaneously. back end that, though,
introduce micro insult framed perfectly, body will
adapt it, that’s really happening exercise adaptation is, hormetic
stressor that’s important is, look immediate responses exercise
see extremely large increase inflammation, see, oxidative stress, see whole


Cascade autophagy, like problems quote unquote happening. It’s actually
quite funny. is, part PhD, academic portion. go
medical side school, physiology class med school,
non-medical doctor class right, PhD. leave lab. walk across
campus take physiology class folks died whole time internally,
every time cover new area, basically exact value
number medical setting like. Oh, gosh they're, going die performance
setting like person's fantastic shape. I've? Never still amuses day,
obviously, it’s just simple things like total blood volume right cover like
okay, patient come blood volume six liters, know can
immediately get diuretic sort going heart attack
blood pressure gets right now, immediately thinking damn six leaders
person super fit actually positive adaptation training it’s one
important, not important Adaptation endurance training enhance, total
blood volume, store blood body fit less
fit. mean go things. Sodium concentrations - potassium
concentrations like look things paper don't know person
die 65 years old shape person going break
world record marathon. brings important tangent, uh,
instance, go take blood test - somebody exercises
intensely uh resistance training, blood creatinine levels can way range,
physician doesn't know certain forms exercise might say:
wow, lot muscle tissue damage occurring body yeah, mentioned
before, total blood volume is, dangerously High, fact, far healthier
need much fitter person who, numbers range, said,
obviously um limits statements, whereby want
cautious take action ameliorate, elevated blood, creatinine level something
sort. point bringing also one field medicine,
many, not all, many Physicians don't take consideration uh outside
activities people doing, becomes kind plug-and-play type, um type
Way looking blood charts, yeah done many thousand athletes, blood chemistry
uh. don't use. First all, never look disease stuff, that’s not do.
take people healthy try optimize performance blood. Chemistry one
best tools. really understand there, can get
incredibly powerful information blood chemistry actually relates
going talk today terms measuring everything acute Chronic dehydration


sleep, deprivation can identified blood Chemistry optimization improvements
nutrition, supplementation lot can get there. people interested field,
Point gentleman named Dan Garner. just absolute Juggernaut
wizard blood chemistry high performance, well can get ton information
that. understand difference exactly talked about. Looking
signals increased risk cardiovascular events, 25 years road versus, this:
optimal value high performance athlete, database
software stuff does, looking things. going talk
biomarkers look little

00:30:20 Recovery Timescales, Adaptation & Optimization

Bit later salivary blood stuff, maybe save part conversation
road. Tell different time scales recovery. Sure actually
trying answer question got way off track, reason
brought Hermetic thing is: understand things acute say, 24
40 hour period, look terrible. It’s actually fine right, stimuli, that’s causing
adaptation. reason brought medical exchange you,
looked inflammatory markers mentioned them, see
highest acute within seconds minutes hours exercise. However, that’s
exactly stimuli needed bring chronically, okay chronically meaning.
Maybe moment elevated maybe coming 24 hours later
48 hours. However, compare resting level say Monday,
worked resting level, Monday week following week following that,
probably see Baseline inflammation goes down, got
really careful. talking immediately post-exercise man, markers look terrible?
Maybe recovery score awful, Etc. That’s not necessarily bad thing,
like looking not change happening today, trying
cause adaptation may take us weeks months actually access. love
highlighting principle, one obvious ones now said
heart rate. Absolutely. heart rate goes very, high exercise,
fairly consistently even semi-consistently. resting heart rate will actually quite bit
lower. That’s fantastic example! Really getting concept,
think it’s important differentiate adaptation optimization. Now hear
word use scientists hate it, it’s good communication tool, optimization


optimizing current moment, almost surely compromising late
adaptation right. If, say, thing right now makes feel absolute
best world like great, took nap donut like awesome,
feel amazing, know it’s causing long-term issues. can said
back end, never choosing things make better right now, never
actually going see adaptation. really recovery
conversation playing game balancing immediate gratification leg
gratification, identify much now versus not? use value
marker? Whether tired feel today, sore today versus score
app tracking metric, blood marker, anything understand. that’s
need cause adaptation, want week month, three months now
case athletes, it’s even four years right, trying cause
adaptations will get us want get Olympics World Championships
World Cup, wherever going that’s framework, think
recovery. maybe falsely think need maximize recovery today
something like taken anti-inflammatory, whether supplementation
drug, maybe ice. Oh cool, that’s great! will enhance recovery
moment. That'Ll make feel better today, probably tomorrow, know
blocks signal adaptation, not going get results. know four
six, eight weeks now. talk recovery, understand tool
am. using order that, understand training
trying maximize middle season athlete
competing tomorrow, going head towards Acute recovery right
actuate performance right now, starting off season, not hedging towards
recovery, actually hedging towards adaptation, not going deploy these,
especially things like evidence combination vitamin C vitamin E will
blunt hypertrophic adaptations anti-inflammatory antioxidants right
Studies shown? Maybe don't uh inhibitory fact may may not
point conceptually. want careful trying optimize for,
forethought alone going dictate decision making
whether not get eyes uh now will cover tools, Like
massage pretty fine use, don't worry blocking

00:35:10 Adaptation & Biomarkers Levels



Long-Term adaptation, others going want careful
principle laid us, set events occur
exercise trigger adaptation sets motion number adaptations
occur recovery give us exact opposite response trigger
go back heart rate example: um heart rate close maximal maximal.
enough times within short know week two weeks resting
heart rate goes down. recall episodes ago, said maximum heart rate
doesn't really change. much. correct? Yes, okay, resting heart rate can
go quite bit yep. general theme meaning less set
upper limit ceiling things like inflammatory markers heart rate, maybe even things
like stress deliberately trigger stress dramatic increase
heart rate dramatic Increase inflammatory markers lowering floor,
ceiling Remains Same. It’s dependent upon marker, case
maximum heart rate, will not change exception one thing age, brings
down. Training will not change circumstances. look something like
inflammatory response, suppose, theoretically, ceiling, though not aware
um. can tell right now, looking blood markers, things like creatine kinase,
remember conversation metabolism use phosphocreatine
one primary fuel sources explosive exercise. Well, using phosphocreatine
creatine kinase, remember, kinase enzymes function break things
part, creatine kinase enzyme use break creatine
that. lot, creatine kinase gets muscle seeps blood
myoglobin actually another fantastic marker. way, myoglobin is, think
hemoglobin blood, molecule carries oxygen around it’s
muscle tissue. it’s myoglobin mild, meaning muscle it’s globulin thing.
bunch markers can look muscle breakdown one things
can see creatine kinase level. That’s elevated say, um, one bout exercise and,
might, might up. know five six-fold. actually seen number
offensive lineman NFL, something like 500 plus fold, even within just one
category next. number can get extraordinarily high know actually
one important Point here, paying attention mechanistic research
use you're, using inform decision making, extraordinarily careful
magnitude Mean is, running western blot looking
signaling protein um muscle uh activation protein turn mitochondrial
biogenesis, saw whatever intervention gave it, whether nutrition thing
drug exercise - saw signaling protein increased 20 percent.


basically assume totally physiologically irrelevant, order
important, totally depends market looking at, markers
might need see four five six hundred fold increase before. know will actually
enough call physiologically relevant others one two percent
relevant, really want careful either reading papers
looking Social Media stuff. people just talking this, marker increase much,
may not matter, may totally irrelevant physiologically,
also, wondering like hell are, people. Well, that’s can
trick little bit intentionally not. just trying best,
don't really understand area enough, that’s important point pay attention to.
So. answer question fully, hard determine truly
maximum level um. things don't want move like blood pH. doesn't really want
move range going move from, know like 6.8 7.4, get
like 7.9, like you're, probably big big big trouble, things can go 500 5 000
fold, markers will really determine answer well point future.
love continue discussion around topic stress, specifically yeah um,
maybe will get little bit later today um get use deliberate
cold exposure, that’s certainly um effects related directly temperature
tissue. certainly mental effects terms raising one's level perceived pain. It’s
fun um, people love people love feeling get it.
Um deliberate cold exposure. people like feeling get not
unlike exercise totally. love train. love exercise, know many people uh um.
loathe exercise, love feeling afterward. will theme will
come back to. Thank indulging interest

00:40:36 4 Recovery Levels, Enhance Recovery

semi-tangent, think it’s relevant tangent thing, can now return
us different time, scales, yeah modes recovery, think
headed get better recovery. Yep. talk tools, talk
measure identify four distinct levels, level one call
overload just quickly means is. workout today. sign
symptom overload fatigued. Acute performance down, worked hard right
now. go, try maximum effort, reduced ability.
recovery period acute overload minutes days right. That’s generally, call


acute overload that’s looking right. systems theoretically
see hormetic stressor come back response, come back, bigger, better, efficient,
Etc. continue training state, like us, say workout
today, little bit acute overload going work tomorrow. little acute
overload can work next day little acute overload. Even took day
it’s doesn't matter right, just continue acute bouts insult
going pushing absolute golden Target, call functional
overreaching. reached can currently results
functional outcome, mean functionally performance enhanced
performance whatever deem stronger, you've, enhanced
muscle size, mitochondria improved you've, whatever thing is, it’s not just
physical performance thing right, amazing, recovery time functional overreaching
typically days maybe even week so, typically, see happen
prior competition. Individuals will call taper, reduced training
volume short period time, reason do. again.
Actualize phrase year adaptations, worked hard six
weeks know, theoretically, workouts. three four five six weeks ago,
allow, system recover will actualized, means performance will
enhanced. functional overreaching golden Target. Okay,
point functional overreaching - continue train intensified whether
intensity volume really. said earlier, something
holding back recovery. doesn't really matter right. It’s it’s sort two sides
coin. move call non-functional overreaching
reached again, now non-functional not see positive benefit
recovery allowed. typically means weeks takes weeks come back from,
basically just get back Baseline, lot folks end
vicious cycle, like man, not getting results. want. going train
harder, not getting results. want going train harder harder,
caught recovery isn't improved, just end spot. train
end spot end up. just either blowing quitting
not getting want. continue past point, may
actually actually call training typically, considered
trained takes months recover people think trained really
not you're. Just probably non-functionally overreached classic distinction is,
took three four days off felt better, weren't, probably quote unquote
trained. probably just area non-functional reaching. need little bit


back off - case. happen gymnasts
cheerleader things take month off barely seeing
start come back Baseline numbers. number areas, mood desire
train testosterone, cortisol ratios biomarkers number areas - physical performance,
vertical jump height, like things just start get back Baseline, true
training actually quite rare. Non-Functional overreaching much common
shorter time frame scale. talk recovery, four pieces
really thinking about, so, concerned about, oh super sore.
get less sore? either not sore next time? workout
super sorry. Now. recover playing first category overload
can certainly talk figure out. quick answer got go back
previous episodes just pay attention volume intensity recommendations
getting significantly uh damage fatigue workout? probably
increased volume quickly, something else dragging stress bucket down,
generally, problem training. Um either didn't warm sufficiently.
fueling strategy off talk Next Episode violated. One
principles increasing intensity volume sort quickly, it’s past
getting stage you're, just like feeling beat time energy going
down, just not feeling like recovered. Now overreaching stage,
story kind tell always years ago working wife Natasha
garage training something like comes stumbling
look Eyes like eyeballs, giant she's, just like wobbling she's.
Like effed up, like mean like effed she's? Just like, read
program wrong like Trump like what'd. like supposed
10 sets three every minute minute three sets ten every minute
minute absolutely wrecked. couldn't move hours afterwards
days, she's. Just like handle kids like, can't get bed.
can't move like classic example right like don't need fix recovery
here, you're, just dummy, dream way hard long like not
don't problem here. it’s situation like that, it’s generally just program
way off. it’s constantly happening you're, just like man like whatever reason,
every while, getting really sore really bad performance
workouts, need go stress bucket. Take look allostatic load
allostasis get figured happening um.




00:48:19 Overreaching vs. Overtraining

happy pointed distinction functional overreaching, training
trained. think one one common mistake people make thinking
biology generally think terms nouns adjectives not verbs amazing.
love much know, biology collection processes processes depending
live, trained trained state that,
many ways, adjective trained trained. It’s like saying, uh,
know American, know Czechoslovakian whatever happens, right
many ways people start associate identity, least transient identity,
start making sorts decisions. sounds like sorts verbs will
will not engage in, whereas think look things processes assign verbs
them, can say: okay, functionally overreaching truly training,
matter Degrees, correct right training matter, not reaching,
not functionally reaching it’s just it’s just performance, know, just
nervous system, won't change unless give reason reason why,
can Perform something perfectly speak language perfectly. no rewiring
nervous system. myth told every experience rewires
nervous system, it’s different now two seconds ago. That’s that’s ridiculous,
illogical statement. know. That’s not true nervous system can perform something,
no reason change won't muscles way.
progressively overload learn something new challenge muscle
something new, it’s thing. example gave uh wife
workout turned far strenuous, functionally overreach.
sense, might training heading direction training,
mistake assume trained right, kind it’s almost becomes
bit state character assignment um, opposed verb, case,
no perfect way describe - talking nouns adjectives also
um talking verbs. think verbs really anchored processes
things actions can take um. may, like just highlight this,
idea shifting one sinking towards verb actions rather labels state
happen person happen right. Sometimes even become
kind character. Logical way people describe uh, believe
something called training training real words,
don't ever really know trained, nailed it. there's. No, know it’s
not like red flag. Uh, know shoots shoulder say trained.


know it’s um, so, hope can start thinking verbs,
actions can take order ensure stimulate Progressive, overload
one way another time, don't fall bins character
assignment suddenly decide need X like take month off
something like that, beginning realize um discussion that’s
exactly wrong way go. fantastic points want make sure clear
no clinical diagnosis training. no standards, no test
blood panel. can pull. actually identify state.
distinction Here, Andrew verbs, rather nouns is, wonderful
exactly case. way really come retroactively, diagnose
one training is, had. weeks recovery got back
Baseline, can't moment. can't take single test, no subjective
marker anything says trained. simply, probably training,
need reverse quickly case step probably non-
functionally overreaching. continue this, will probably enter new stage
training need come back. that’s important thing
let people know no one thing actually point says

00:52:53 Tool: Acute Overload & Recovery, Breathwork

not noun, verb. tools can use
enhance recovery yep? start off acute overload phase. So, words,
just workout feeling awful just one two days ago super sore.
get rid right now? Well, couple things can immediately
workout others maybe actionable day later two days
later just cover handful them. nutrition hydration
supplementation next episode. going cover everything else, not category
right now, couple things number one. can actually start Kickstart recovery
process end current training session, guess say way.
strongly suggest start recovery process immediately workout
mentioned earlier idea got get really high peak stress cause
adaptation, actually didn't explain correctly, happen
need extremely High peak, met extremely sharp
recovery back down, know talked
neuroplasticity stuff terms happen caused insult.


immediately need able recover make sure causes changes brains
thing happens here. need really sharp high inflammatory response
then, not meet immediate recovery period, signal won't
maximize results. mean can actually couple things? Number
one actually listening slow, paced, music evidence suggest fast-paced music
may slow recovery slow pace actually enhance it. just change
know maximum get get going music workout
slower, lower Cadence will help kick start idea similar note. can also
use call regulation breathing. conjunction one
other, whichever you, personal favorite method somewhere
three ten minutes finishing training session. Laying like
position, certainly Lotus position, think laying back
generally effective personal preference there, no science, like items
covered getting dark quiet sort area Then, just breathing nose
structured, Cadence, lot different things. can try easy example. just
box breathing can imagine box four squares. going
inhale somewhere between, like three eight seconds whatever number
choose, keep tempo, say chose five second inhale,
that’s going take vertically horizontally box five second hold
five second exhale five second hold, just need repeat
time domain. Now typically honestly don't use timer you'll, actually notice. lot
people will like fall asleep get really close falling asleep period. can
triangle version that, inhale, hold exhale go right back
inhale bunch different tricks. can try here, need play around
see actually works best you. Um 10 minutes probably better, can just
least give three that'll work, really really resistant, can actually that. Just
shower, going finish workout get shower again, just close
eyes shower, give three minutes focused relaxation breathing will
accelerate recovery process. love particularly love laboratory
works stress respiration, okay, breathing interactions two
just mention result just accepted publication, time day.
uh. Thank you. Uh beautiful work uh, not directly, although took
place lab, know, it’s students doctors um, Dr Melise uh, balbon
uh lab. It’s phenomenal researcher showed short period five minutes
box breathing exactly type described cyclic sign two inhales, followed
extended exhale lungs empty. Ideally, inhales done nose.


exhales done. Uh mouth, although done nose, um
mouth matter, probably nose. Nose inhale, inhale mouth exhale
um uh inhales, nose exhale nose. Cyclic sighing,
refer done five minutes, produce significant decreases resting
heart rate. time will increase things like heart rate, variability
forth. Um provided extended exhales. seems like calming response,
reduction overall stress occurs. thing really sends things
direction something like cyclic hyperventilation. sure observed um
interestingly uh, people just five minutes meditation which,
which, course, breathing just allowing breathing progress.
However, happens moment, um moments across five minutes uh.
reductions sorts markers stress described not significant
breathing. love Brock's breathing tool, post, workout, um
Alternatives too, just mentioned, think people greatly underestimate
potency breathing shifting one's nervous system function away stress one
wants toward alertness stress. actually couple questions
sure. think audience appreciate uh. long boxes? just
user selected great question, use carbon dioxide tolerance test amazing order
people determine long different sides Box be, cover
carbon dioxide tolerance tests. previous episode, can provide link clip um
show, note captions, but, point out, involves long extended exhale lungs,
empty um and, course, people sit lungs empty, accurately
Faithfully say report long took empty lungs. use
gauge. Typically, takes, people go lungs empty 20 seconds less, believe
go back paper look, believe duration sides
boxes were, somewhere um two three seconds,
CO2 discard time anywhere uh 20 seconds 40 45 seconds, use it.
sides box, believe, four six seconds people
longer discard Arrow period minute more. used
box duration inhale, hold exhale, hold duration somewhere between. believe
[ Music, ], um, seven, maybe eight long 11 12 seconds yeah.
will get kind free diver types. can really this? really well
trained sort thing? don't quote exactly numbers,
approximate. line exactly done. believe it’s it’s going
close within seconds non-important Distinction. it’s going close enough,
that’s great, uh. took six weeks. study done


period month swapped new pattern breathing um,
condition meditation condition - done natural world, say, um
wearing whoop bands. getting heart rate, heart rate, variability, sleep,
data, subjective data mood Etc. lot measures, um
100 subjects wild life um tried best track life, stress
events exercise, things like harder control outside laboratory.
Really results speak exactly exactly describing here,
deliberate respiration involves controlled holds exhales really dramatic
immediate impact reducing levels stress. That’s wonderful! not surprised
findings really interesting that, mentioned
exhalation portion primarily responsible regulation that’s actually goes
back previous endurance conversation, general rest, non-altitude
increases Co2 primary driver ventilation, generally means
inhales associated uptick sympathetic State exhales associated
uptick parasympathetic State. generally, folks will things like exhale
finish exhale right perform high Precision, neurological tasks.
going say, aim Target shoot going Exhale fully almost
always execute movement end exhale, that’s
highest parasympathetic State lowest drive ventilation. say not surprised
guys found actually data point individuals, particularly
endurance. Training can get back Baseline heart rate going
correlated with. gets actual results training. Said take
bunch individuals put endurance training program,
measure quickly can get back Baseline workout general,
folks better going see greater improvements Performance
end say, four six eight week, training block little bit
causation correlation untie. think it’s enough say: hey
invest three case study five minutes. It’s going
enhance recovery, likelihood increasing results training, now
also additional benefits like able transition appropriately next
task, going work going see family whatever thing is, it’s it’s nice close to,
asked high, sympathetic State body, asked perform
stress. gave recovery now ready transition next thing
don't take exercise energy. will next

01:03:39 Tool: Alleviate Acute Soreness, Compression Clothing



task may may not want sympathetic Drive state. somebody sore
following workout, either locally sore muscle, group group muscles, maybe
legs chest torso maybe whole body sore sometimes case.
tools can Implement order accelerate the? want call
moving soreness, it’s really, know, alleviation soreness
bunch different processes. effective tools push back
soreness dissipate yeah? Absolutely. First all, it’s not lactate! That’s just really
important thing still hear people talk about. know sore 24 hours later
got thing get lactate there, talked metabolism,
uh conversation episode not cause fatigue it’s certainly not
cause soreness. not actionable tip there, just pet peeve mine. hear
people say get irritated can maybe end conversation um strategies,
tools, can do, can actually wear compression gear will help little
bit. decent amount evidence, suggesting, just you, know, put
tighter fitting clothes Leisure, wear compression gear. can
actually prevent little bit soreness occurring. case poor
Natasha - realize just done way way much went hung
bow hunting friend trained way hard, realize, oh, goodness,
going sore here. can immediately put compression gear weigh
really long possible. examples compression gear? seen
people plane high high socks um, mean anything wear
compression gear exercise. whether just know,
compression pants leggings tight fitting leggings uh, whether long sleeve
shirt, that’s like rash guard, wear know Jiu, Jitsu surfing, something
like that. long it’s tight fitting, doesn't much can wear.
suppose get socks, great, generally just tell leads them.
put long sleeve compression shirts wear training
long, compression, leggings that'd fine. Can people apply compression
um Garb training still get positive effects yeah? not seen
evidence suggest block adaptation. may case. not aware
studies happens, certainly know information suggests can
hands little bit Muscle Recovery. ideally one knows workout
trigger lot soreness yeah compression gear sort
offset that, local muscle groups working
Reason asked socks understanding. socks uh, compression


socks people plane it’s going shift patterns blood flow, not just
lower legs, body yeah you're, probably going want focus
actual exercising tissue, though, Actually, that’s really good question. don't know
answer whether not upper body workout lower body compression
gear. actually help that’s great question. may done. don't know,
don't know answer general, just tell people like where, whole
thing much can um, actually not concerned wearing
workout. something put afterwards even wear just little bit
compression day. Um actually really fun study. Uh. collaborated
um Bill Kramer who's. Uh, know, Sports scientist Year award. bill Cramer
award, gives indication uh University Connecticut, well Lee
Brown, two Lifetime Achievement Award winners put people plane
stores, Connecticut flew Cal State Fullerton. cross-country flight
got wear compression gear flight others not,
landed California training bout put back plane, went back stores
think another training bout got back there. lot data
came paper, one things clear compression group
effective handling blood related coagulation issues associated
long flights particularly athletic performance. that’s actually sneaky little Insider trick
use lot people, particularly athletes traveling, just wear
compression gear plane. talked sort rung study
mind another effective strategy, compression gear general, well
particularly plane, basically tighter can get better, without obviously
making hands purple uncomfortable things like that, doesn't
overly tight. Anything will work probably help. also personally,
anytime, taking

01:08:27 Tool: Acute Soreness, Massage, Temperature

flight like much can just feel little better get there.
methods can use alleviate acute soreness? Well, continue
theme, saying okay, use sort pressure manipulation
enhance recovery. compression one strategy, can also use things like compression
boots garments, nomadic devices will know, pump uh air outside
compress back forth. number devices will this. can


also use physical hand, massage body work they're, really
working best. can tell mechanisms effectively moving fluid
tissue, well potentially enhancing blood flow, increasing capitalization
going get nutrients waste products out. can kind pick
choose based upon budget preferences availability timing, things like that,
effective strategies outside really next largest category, now
thermal uh, far discussion, mentioned cold water, Immersion
talked hypertrophy section not want immediately: post
exercise, getting cold water ice bath trying grow muscle
mass. said that, good evidence showing cold water immersion
specifically effective reducing muscle soreness. fair consideration it’s
classic example no free passes physiology. Nothing always good
always bad. It’s always willing give versus willing
get case like cold water immersion? may thinking yeah. might want
hypertrophic adaptations, phase training,
actually trying push towards optimization moment, rather long-term
adaptation, ice bath might great choice. addition, fall scenario
like Natasha - realize like just unbelievably sore - might cost three
four five six days training. might worth accelerate recovery
process couple days don't miss much training. it’s just it’s
algorithm, it’s equation. looking season trying compete
just done way way much exercise, really significant pain.
probably willing give small percentage eventual muscle growth
single session get pain cold strategies. Cold water immersion clearly
best approach rather cold air tactics. cold shower probably
not enough here. really want either moderately cold. maybe 40 50
degree, water probably north 15 minutes can sub 40 little maybe
five minutes get fact number studies um.
sort summarizing bunch kind one rather going Point
point. numbers just threw uh, assuming um uh Fahrenheit um,
seem seem really cold right uncomfortably cold. Absolutely always recommend
people ease protocol overall not immediately go 35 degree uh
cold water, never done uh. said, people comfortable
uncomfortable, always answer question: cold exactly?
agree very, cold much really really want get out,
able stay safely? Whatever value happens be, absolutely


need safe. said that, actually, xbt Retreats, put dozens, not
hundreds people point, uh immediately sub 35 degree water first time
ever done. know three minutes multiple rounds session, can handle it.
don't need go crazy. don't want kind play game right,
want really really cold short amount time, want like kind
cold longer amount time? really mistake can make
something like know, 65 degree water people not comfortable
know five ten minutes. It’s just not going be. It’s probably not going
effective. like man 35 is, absolutely crazy want 55 degree, water
literature area. it’s going say need probably
somewhere, almost really north 10 minutes, will actually show need
like well north 20 30 minutes. money rather go really really
cold get done five minutes, um personal preference one. can also
make little bit easier yourself. not nearly much evidence,
contrast. Stuff uh, go cold, hot sort back forth.
no really good rules terms much go, many rounds, long
cold long hot couple studies obviously
studies use numbers, doesn't mean tested See optimal,
big difference, can really just kind play feel hot good
Recovery. just careful going put blood flow
area, may walk additional acute swelling isn't going
put greater pressure there. kind play that. personally really like
hot Recovery. will feel - maybe not great moment, next day tend feel
really really good. addition, wake next morning really really hurting
super stiff, hot bath will help um quite bit, can play
protocols. Again, don't

01:14:21 Cold & Heat Contrast, Cold Shower vs. Immersion, Sauna & Fertility

nice absolutely no requirement so. just option interested
studies Dr Susanna soberg sure yeah not directly aimed alleviating soreness
recovery, increasing thermal capacity storage uh Brown adipose
tissue, not blubbery fat stuff around clavicles around heart help
generate body, heat rest metabolism on, numbers um
come not tested possible derivations just like


breathing. five minute sessions, knows? Maybe minute
equally effective. just constraints sorts studies, values
come with, seem good thresholds making sure
adaptation response triggered heat cold. ends 57 minutes per week,
total uncomfortable safe heat case sauna, can one session
breaking couple sessions day different days, 11
minutes per week. cold either one single session multiple sessions, one
um one break know multiple days one day
one. know hour sauna 11 minutes colder vice versa,
although seems little bit extreme, especially uninitiated.
numbers studied. point out, not lot really thorough
studies examining different cold protocols according temperature time requirements.
bit subjective, feel required establish routine, actually say
another time re-emphasize something. talked beginning
conversation, pain not defined outcome. It’s heavily influenced
perception, so, don't feel like work you, won't work. feel like
work fantastic, so. It’s challenging field get really objective data
always going little bit subjective nature. things, can tell
anecdotally: used hot cold contrast long time athletes. love
don't care everything between. it’s one things never
mandate it. course, can't mandate anything anyone work with, never
know like hey. interested great struggling area? want try this?
liked great struggling area, tried it. didn't love it.
Okay, fine, not find routes, will get lot ways enhance
recovery um. one hasn't even really come stopping problem
first place, not just treating symptoms, first line defense,
really need go back figure it’s happening begin with, Solution,
just different acute symptom management tactics. One final point uh,
deliberate, cold exposure. think worth mentioning one reasons shower
effective, not nearly effective cold water, immersion immersion ice
neck simply reason stated before, showers not
going get cold not going get know sub 40s. Also cold
showers haven't really studied much have, not nearly much
immersion people always ask just think challenges studying cold water
exposure shower, can't really control mango? much body
covered, whether not head stays different size bodies, Etc? Whereas


people come laboratory, can get cold large, know neck
is. know chin can make sure people's arms um legs
underneath, cold shower sure can make everyone face away toward
shower, it’s really tricky um variations described. said,
agree one wants use deliberate cold exposure, cold shower better
nothing cold immersion circulating, cold water ice bath better um
cold shower yeah? actually say looking recovery muscle soreness,
say cold shower, probably little, not going able
get enough cold water onto muscle, besides, basically head, maybe
try cold bath least get surface area coverage, yeah want
use cold shower awesome reasons cold shower. That’s totally great.
trying use recover low back glutes sore training
good way, it’s probably not going much immersion there.
actually also hit sneaky point, is, can't get water super cold, just
make water move. Jets stuff can turn anyone tried
like. Okay, can 40 degree. Bath awesome, try 60, water
moving right, break thermal layer. Normally little thin layer
water heating up. break up. It’s whole new world, yeah, absolutely
still cold. Water actually weaker way go correct can make
face stoic, make body circulate water around long
this. Maybe just one point heat uh: certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry,
sauna, steam saunas. Excuse me, jacuzzis can work pretty well yep um uh males.
looking conceive 60 days following uh uh following sauna um, hot tub realize
approaches severely limit number motile sperm um
substantially. people not trying conceive uh. Don'T think works
reliably enough, use form contraception yeah, people
trying conceive. really detrimental sperm Health right reason
people bring ice pack put groin near groin go
um, hard hot tub sauna. getting fine points,
um crude points, will pun intended, um, idea wouldn't want
anyone approach techniques compromise life goals, certainly not
allowed anywhere near things. uh, stage Life, just say
Natasha put x hanging Laird. reasons, like you're, not
going you're, not going none stuff, just wait right heat um heat


sperm relationship it’s not one that’s positive sperm


01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques

ways combine various types stimuli described inducing
recovery? talked breathing based tools which, adjust indeed
adjust oxygen carbon dioxide ratios Etc. guessing major effect
recovery going neural. It’s going deliberate, calm nervous system,
sympathetic, based uh, mentioned, yeah definitely, talked
movement based touch-based approaches. Um, will uh movement
circulate, certainly will circulate blood, also will generate contractions muscles yep
right, maybe, if, indeed again, still speculates you, indeed soreness
due excessive stretch swelling stretch, ends muscles
make sense movement touch thermal, ways combine
um effective maybe even synergistic yeah. suppose throw uh
compression garments put Pneumatic compression device sit sauna.
regulate breath like fine. Quite honestly, though,
probably don't need maximize them. joking. probably go
light swim regulating breathing cold water. get compression
cold, water good spot, certainly that. reality
is. generally look physical approach holistic approach breath
work. Basically, want breath something else knock two things
good spot, breath thermal stress, just
controlling unregulation stuff. also remember ice stressor
actually show data second actually can enhance
systemic recovery, although won't happen acute minutes. fact, it’s going
take least 30 60 minutes eventually see rebound effect, acutely it’s
going make actually sympathetic, going direction. can
opposite can actually drive up. it’s little bit dependent upon
respond, time day you're, using general, guess combining
need um, depending available. perhaps don't
sauna, can take hot bath great. Maybe percussion device
tool can use that. don't sauna amazing. don't ice bath


things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

glycolysis carbohydrates, remember, finished aerobic
Metabolism, even lifting weights using carbs fuel,
got finish metabolism running mitochondria Performing oxidative
metabolism. result electron transport chain runs. So, theoretically, free
radicals, hyper-reactive oxygen species, basically oxygen
molecules missing electrons, react lot things,
opposite antioxidants. way, oxygen molecules extra protons,
can balance charge leak going massive,
inflammatory signal that’s probably signals cause neutrophils
macrophages kicks off entire Cascade again, believe need research
there. need look it. Maybe it’s definitive know, that’s probably
happening potentially happening rather causes Cascade Signal. Also,
combination of. Well, that’s case, not getting
tremendous amount muscle damage aerobic based exercise? Well,
don't mechanical tension pulling fibers, that’s actually causing
damage cell wall allows free radicals escape mitochondria
cell wall. that’s best. can postulate moment things
happening low level exercise tends enhance even things like
percussion, using either instruments put low level vibration leg like
pneumatic boots. can massage things generally probably helping
moving stuff demon specifically pressure comes off
nerve, endings muscle spindles, allows stop receiving signal
pain. Despite fact didn't actually regenerate tissue yet fascinating,
think beautifully frames headed next, talk different
modes recovery accelerate perhaps even combine different
forms recovery order become better recovering make faster
progress Fitness

00:18:56 Exercise, Homeostasis & Hormesis; Blood Test & Fitness Level

kick off discussion recovery understanding recovery
specific adaptations exercise actually occur. love share us
happens needs happen recovery order us get better anything,
endurance, strength, Etc, also specific types exercise, stimuli specific types
adaptations trigger running bit further. Lifting bit weight, slowing


Cadence given movement, Etc. specific types triggers adaptation relate
specific maybe similar types recovery required us make progress
one previous episodes. talking Harvard fatigue lab really
identified idea homeostasis least sort championed that’s important
levels physiology wants return homeostasis. happens terms
adaptation? challenged level realizes? not make change,
will not able get back level homeostasis. That’s fundamentally
happening. recovery, process taking insult temporarily reduced
functionality, causing change now come back get often call
support performance super compensation. really doing, though, bringing
new level homeostasis effectively. understanding insult comes again.
need able make sure doesn't cause level disruption,
raise bar whether enhancing ability take level mechanical
tension muscle not result micro damage. Whether able take
reduction energy not compromise sleep anything, it’s really
fundamentally changing. can new level homeostasis, it’s
presuming it’s predicting insult going come road.
wanted clarify people Dr Galvin says insult may actually insult me,
um insult nerd speak terminology sort damage inflicted tissue
system. um speaking insult muscle insult neuromuscular
connection, created adding weight bar running distance um running
bit fast pedaling faster. creates micro insult insult. now,
everyone familiar um, psychological verbal insults, never forget
biological concept, it’s important. tag another thing here, called hormesis. It’s
one favorite phenomenon, effectively means dosage
toxicity, responds almost everything. think context say
drugs, means is, gave 10 milligrams something okay,
give 20 it'd problem eventually, go give enough, thing
turns toxic: case everything cyanide, can actually small
dosages nature. fact, it’s many fruits eat, it’s not dosage,
doesn't matter dosage gets higher, though actually can cause problems,
high enough, can actually kill instantaneously. back end that, though,
introduce micro insult framed perfectly, body will
adapt it, that’s really happening exercise adaptation is, hormetic
stressor that’s important is, look immediate responses exercise
see extremely large increase inflammation, see, oxidative stress, see whole


Cascade autophagy, like problems quote unquote happening. It’s actually
quite funny. is, part PhD, academic portion. go
medical side school, physiology class med school,
non-medical doctor class right, PhD. leave lab. walk across
campus take physiology class folks died whole time internally,
every time cover new area, basically exact value
number medical setting like. Oh, gosh they're, going die performance
setting like person's fantastic shape. I've? Never still amuses day,
obviously, it’s just simple things like total blood volume right cover like
okay, patient come blood volume six liters, know can
immediately get diuretic sort going heart attack
blood pressure gets right now, immediately thinking damn six leaders
person super fit actually positive adaptation training it’s one
important, not important Adaptation endurance training enhance, total
blood volume, store blood body fit less
fit. mean go things. Sodium concentrations - potassium
concentrations like look things paper don't know person
die 65 years old shape person going break
world record marathon. brings important tangent, uh,
instance, go take blood test - somebody exercises
intensely uh resistance training, blood creatinine levels can way range,
physician doesn't know certain forms exercise might say:
wow, lot muscle tissue damage occurring body yeah, mentioned
before, total blood volume is, dangerously High, fact, far healthier
need much fitter person who, numbers range, said,
obviously um limits statements, whereby want
cautious take action ameliorate, elevated blood, creatinine level something
sort. point bringing also one field medicine,
many, not all, many Physicians don't take consideration uh outside
activities people doing, becomes kind plug-and-play type, um type
Way looking blood charts, yeah done many thousand athletes, blood chemistry
uh. don't use. First all, never look disease stuff, that’s not do.
take people healthy try optimize performance blood. Chemistry one
best tools. really understand there, can get
incredibly powerful information blood chemistry actually relates
going talk today terms measuring everything acute Chronic dehydration


sleep, deprivation can identified blood Chemistry optimization improvements
nutrition, supplementation lot can get there. people interested field,
Point gentleman named Dan Garner. just absolute Juggernaut
wizard blood chemistry high performance, well can get ton information
that. understand difference exactly talked about. Looking
signals increased risk cardiovascular events, 25 years road versus, this:
optimal value high performance athlete, database
software stuff does, looking things. going talk
biomarkers look little

00:30:20 Recovery Timescales, Adaptation & Optimization

Bit later salivary blood stuff, maybe save part conversation
road. Tell different time scales recovery. Sure actually
trying answer question got way off track, reason
brought Hermetic thing is: understand things acute say, 24
40 hour period, look terrible. It’s actually fine right, stimuli, that’s causing
adaptation. reason brought medical exchange you,
looked inflammatory markers mentioned them, see
highest acute within seconds minutes hours exercise. However, that’s
exactly stimuli needed bring chronically, okay chronically meaning.
Maybe moment elevated maybe coming 24 hours later
48 hours. However, compare resting level say Monday,
worked resting level, Monday week following week following that,
probably see Baseline inflammation goes down, got
really careful. talking immediately post-exercise man, markers look terrible?
Maybe recovery score awful, Etc. That’s not necessarily bad thing,
like looking not change happening today, trying
cause adaptation may take us weeks months actually access. love
highlighting principle, one obvious ones now said
heart rate. Absolutely. heart rate goes very, high exercise,
fairly consistently even semi-consistently. resting heart rate will actually quite bit
lower. That’s fantastic example! Really getting concept,
think it’s important differentiate adaptation optimization. Now hear
word use scientists hate it, it’s good communication tool, optimization


optimizing current moment, almost surely compromising late
adaptation right. If, say, thing right now makes feel absolute
best world like great, took nap donut like awesome,
feel amazing, know it’s causing long-term issues. can said
back end, never choosing things make better right now, never
actually going see adaptation. really recovery
conversation playing game balancing immediate gratification leg
gratification, identify much now versus not? use value
marker? Whether tired feel today, sore today versus score
app tracking metric, blood marker, anything understand. that’s
need cause adaptation, want week month, three months now
case athletes, it’s even four years right, trying cause
adaptations will get us want get Olympics World Championships
World Cup, wherever going that’s framework, think
recovery. maybe falsely think need maximize recovery today
something like taken anti-inflammatory, whether supplementation
drug, maybe ice. Oh cool, that’s great! will enhance recovery
moment. That'Ll make feel better today, probably tomorrow, know
blocks signal adaptation, not going get results. know four
six, eight weeks now. talk recovery, understand tool
am. using order that, understand training
trying maximize middle season athlete
competing tomorrow, going head towards Acute recovery right
actuate performance right now, starting off season, not hedging towards
recovery, actually hedging towards adaptation, not going deploy these,
especially things like evidence combination vitamin C vitamin E will
blunt hypertrophic adaptations anti-inflammatory antioxidants right
Studies shown? Maybe don't uh inhibitory fact may may not
point conceptually. want careful trying optimize for,
forethought alone going dictate decision making
whether not get eyes uh now will cover tools, Like
massage pretty fine use, don't worry blocking

00:35:10 Adaptation & Biomarkers Levels



Long-Term adaptation, others going want careful
principle laid us, set events occur
exercise trigger adaptation sets motion number adaptations
occur recovery give us exact opposite response trigger
go back heart rate example: um heart rate close maximal maximal.
enough times within short know week two weeks resting
heart rate goes down. recall episodes ago, said maximum heart rate
doesn't really change. much. correct? Yes, okay, resting heart rate can
go quite bit yep. general theme meaning less set
upper limit ceiling things like inflammatory markers heart rate, maybe even things
like stress deliberately trigger stress dramatic increase
heart rate dramatic Increase inflammatory markers lowering floor,
ceiling Remains Same. It’s dependent upon marker, case
maximum heart rate, will not change exception one thing age, brings
down. Training will not change circumstances. look something like
inflammatory response, suppose, theoretically, ceiling, though not aware
um. can tell right now, looking blood markers, things like creatine kinase,
remember conversation metabolism use phosphocreatine
one primary fuel sources explosive exercise. Well, using phosphocreatine
creatine kinase, remember, kinase enzymes function break things
part, creatine kinase enzyme use break creatine
that. lot, creatine kinase gets muscle seeps blood
myoglobin actually another fantastic marker. way, myoglobin is, think
hemoglobin blood, molecule carries oxygen around it’s
muscle tissue. it’s myoglobin mild, meaning muscle it’s globulin thing.
bunch markers can look muscle breakdown one things
can see creatine kinase level. That’s elevated say, um, one bout exercise and,
might, might up. know five six-fold. actually seen number
offensive lineman NFL, something like 500 plus fold, even within just one
category next. number can get extraordinarily high know actually
one important Point here, paying attention mechanistic research
use you're, using inform decision making, extraordinarily careful
magnitude Mean is, running western blot looking
signaling protein um muscle uh activation protein turn mitochondrial
biogenesis, saw whatever intervention gave it, whether nutrition thing
drug exercise - saw signaling protein increased 20 percent.


basically assume totally physiologically irrelevant, order
important, totally depends market looking at, markers
might need see four five six hundred fold increase before. know will actually
enough call physiologically relevant others one two percent
relevant, really want careful either reading papers
looking Social Media stuff. people just talking this, marker increase much,
may not matter, may totally irrelevant physiologically,
also, wondering like hell are, people. Well, that’s can
trick little bit intentionally not. just trying best,
don't really understand area enough, that’s important point pay attention to.
So. answer question fully, hard determine truly
maximum level um. things don't want move like blood pH. doesn't really want
move range going move from, know like 6.8 7.4, get
like 7.9, like you're, probably big big big trouble, things can go 500 5 000
fold, markers will really determine answer well point future.
love continue discussion around topic stress, specifically yeah um,
maybe will get little bit later today um get use deliberate
cold exposure, that’s certainly um effects related directly temperature
tissue. certainly mental effects terms raising one's level perceived pain. It’s
fun um, people love people love feeling get it.
Um deliberate cold exposure. people like feeling get not
unlike exercise totally. love train. love exercise, know many people uh um.
loathe exercise, love feeling afterward. will theme will
come back to. Thank indulging interest

00:40:36 4 Recovery Levels, Enhance Recovery

semi-tangent, think it’s relevant tangent thing, can now return
us different time, scales, yeah modes recovery, think
headed get better recovery. Yep. talk tools, talk
measure identify four distinct levels, level one call
overload just quickly means is. workout today. sign
symptom overload fatigued. Acute performance down, worked hard right
now. go, try maximum effort, reduced ability.
recovery period acute overload minutes days right. That’s generally, call


acute overload that’s looking right. systems theoretically
see hormetic stressor come back response, come back, bigger, better, efficient,
Etc. continue training state, like us, say workout
today, little bit acute overload going work tomorrow. little acute
overload can work next day little acute overload. Even took day
it’s doesn't matter right, just continue acute bouts insult
going pushing absolute golden Target, call functional
overreaching. reached can currently results
functional outcome, mean functionally performance enhanced
performance whatever deem stronger, you've, enhanced
muscle size, mitochondria improved you've, whatever thing is, it’s not just
physical performance thing right, amazing, recovery time functional overreaching
typically days maybe even week so, typically, see happen
prior competition. Individuals will call taper, reduced training
volume short period time, reason do. again.
Actualize phrase year adaptations, worked hard six
weeks know, theoretically, workouts. three four five six weeks ago,
allow, system recover will actualized, means performance will
enhanced. functional overreaching golden Target. Okay,
point functional overreaching - continue train intensified whether
intensity volume really. said earlier, something
holding back recovery. doesn't really matter right. It’s it’s sort two sides
coin. move call non-functional overreaching
reached again, now non-functional not see positive benefit
recovery allowed. typically means weeks takes weeks come back from,
basically just get back Baseline, lot folks end
vicious cycle, like man, not getting results. want. going train
harder, not getting results. want going train harder harder,
caught recovery isn't improved, just end spot. train
end spot end up. just either blowing quitting
not getting want. continue past point, may
actually actually call training typically, considered
trained takes months recover people think trained really
not you're. Just probably non-functionally overreached classic distinction is,
took three four days off felt better, weren't, probably quote unquote
trained. probably just area non-functional reaching. need little bit


back off - case. happen gymnasts
cheerleader things take month off barely seeing
start come back Baseline numbers. number areas, mood desire
train testosterone, cortisol ratios biomarkers number areas - physical performance,
vertical jump height, like things just start get back Baseline, true
training actually quite rare. Non-Functional overreaching much common
shorter time frame scale. talk recovery, four pieces
really thinking about, so, concerned about, oh super sore.
get less sore? either not sore next time? workout
super sorry. Now. recover playing first category overload
can certainly talk figure out. quick answer got go back
previous episodes just pay attention volume intensity recommendations
getting significantly uh damage fatigue workout? probably
increased volume quickly, something else dragging stress bucket down,
generally, problem training. Um either didn't warm sufficiently.
fueling strategy off talk Next Episode violated. One
principles increasing intensity volume sort quickly, it’s past
getting stage you're, just like feeling beat time energy going
down, just not feeling like recovered. Now overreaching stage,
story kind tell always years ago working wife Natasha
garage training something like comes stumbling
look Eyes like eyeballs, giant she's, just like wobbling she's.
Like effed up, like mean like effed she's? Just like, read
program wrong like Trump like what'd. like supposed
10 sets three every minute minute three sets ten every minute
minute absolutely wrecked. couldn't move hours afterwards
days, she's. Just like handle kids like, can't get bed.
can't move like classic example right like don't need fix recovery
here, you're, just dummy, dream way hard long like not
don't problem here. it’s situation like that, it’s generally just program
way off. it’s constantly happening you're, just like man like whatever reason,
every while, getting really sore really bad performance
workouts, need go stress bucket. Take look allostatic load
allostasis get figured happening um.




00:48:19 Overreaching vs. Overtraining

happy pointed distinction functional overreaching, training
trained. think one one common mistake people make thinking
biology generally think terms nouns adjectives not verbs amazing.
love much know, biology collection processes processes depending
live, trained trained state that,
many ways, adjective trained trained. It’s like saying, uh,
know American, know Czechoslovakian whatever happens, right
many ways people start associate identity, least transient identity,
start making sorts decisions. sounds like sorts verbs will
will not engage in, whereas think look things processes assign verbs
them, can say: okay, functionally overreaching truly training,
matter Degrees, correct right training matter, not reaching,
not functionally reaching it’s just it’s just performance, know, just
nervous system, won't change unless give reason reason why,
can Perform something perfectly speak language perfectly. no rewiring
nervous system. myth told every experience rewires
nervous system, it’s different now two seconds ago. That’s that’s ridiculous,
illogical statement. know. That’s not true nervous system can perform something,
no reason change won't muscles way.
progressively overload learn something new challenge muscle
something new, it’s thing. example gave uh wife
workout turned far strenuous, functionally overreach.
sense, might training heading direction training,
mistake assume trained right, kind it’s almost becomes
bit state character assignment um, opposed verb, case,
no perfect way describe - talking nouns adjectives also
um talking verbs. think verbs really anchored processes
things actions can take um. may, like just highlight this,
idea shifting one sinking towards verb actions rather labels state
happen person happen right. Sometimes even become
kind character. Logical way people describe uh, believe
something called training training real words,
don't ever really know trained, nailed it. there's. No, know it’s
not like red flag. Uh, know shoots shoulder say trained.


know it’s um, so, hope can start thinking verbs,
actions can take order ensure stimulate Progressive, overload
one way another time, don't fall bins character
assignment suddenly decide need X like take month off
something like that, beginning realize um discussion that’s
exactly wrong way go. fantastic points want make sure clear
no clinical diagnosis training. no standards, no test
blood panel. can pull. actually identify state.
distinction Here, Andrew verbs, rather nouns is, wonderful
exactly case. way really come retroactively, diagnose
one training is, had. weeks recovery got back
Baseline, can't moment. can't take single test, no subjective
marker anything says trained. simply, probably training,
need reverse quickly case step probably non-
functionally overreaching. continue this, will probably enter new stage
training need come back. that’s important thing
let people know no one thing actually point says

00:52:53 Tool: Acute Overload & Recovery, Breathwork

not noun, verb. tools can use
enhance recovery yep? start off acute overload phase. So, words,
just workout feeling awful just one two days ago super sore.
get rid right now? Well, couple things can immediately
workout others maybe actionable day later two days
later just cover handful them. nutrition hydration
supplementation next episode. going cover everything else, not category
right now, couple things number one. can actually start Kickstart recovery
process end current training session, guess say way.
strongly suggest start recovery process immediately workout
mentioned earlier idea got get really high peak stress cause
adaptation, actually didn't explain correctly, happen
need extremely High peak, met extremely sharp
recovery back down, know talked
neuroplasticity stuff terms happen caused insult.


immediately need able recover make sure causes changes brains
thing happens here. need really sharp high inflammatory response
then, not meet immediate recovery period, signal won't
maximize results. mean can actually couple things? Number
one actually listening slow, paced, music evidence suggest fast-paced music
may slow recovery slow pace actually enhance it. just change
know maximum get get going music workout
slower, lower Cadence will help kick start idea similar note. can also
use call regulation breathing. conjunction one
other, whichever you, personal favorite method somewhere
three ten minutes finishing training session. Laying like
position, certainly Lotus position, think laying back
generally effective personal preference there, no science, like items
covered getting dark quiet sort area Then, just breathing nose
structured, Cadence, lot different things. can try easy example. just
box breathing can imagine box four squares. going
inhale somewhere between, like three eight seconds whatever number
choose, keep tempo, say chose five second inhale,
that’s going take vertically horizontally box five second hold
five second exhale five second hold, just need repeat
time domain. Now typically honestly don't use timer you'll, actually notice. lot
people will like fall asleep get really close falling asleep period. can
triangle version that, inhale, hold exhale go right back
inhale bunch different tricks. can try here, need play around
see actually works best you. Um 10 minutes probably better, can just
least give three that'll work, really really resistant, can actually that. Just
shower, going finish workout get shower again, just close
eyes shower, give three minutes focused relaxation breathing will
accelerate recovery process. love particularly love laboratory
works stress respiration, okay, breathing interactions two
just mention result just accepted publication, time day.
uh. Thank you. Uh beautiful work uh, not directly, although took
place lab, know, it’s students doctors um, Dr Melise uh, balbon
uh lab. It’s phenomenal researcher showed short period five minutes
box breathing exactly type described cyclic sign two inhales, followed
extended exhale lungs empty. Ideally, inhales done nose.


exhales done. Uh mouth, although done nose, um
mouth matter, probably nose. Nose inhale, inhale mouth exhale
um uh inhales, nose exhale nose. Cyclic sighing,
refer done five minutes, produce significant decreases resting
heart rate. time will increase things like heart rate, variability
forth. Um provided extended exhales. seems like calming response,
reduction overall stress occurs. thing really sends things
direction something like cyclic hyperventilation. sure observed um
interestingly uh, people just five minutes meditation which,
which, course, breathing just allowing breathing progress.
However, happens moment, um moments across five minutes uh.
reductions sorts markers stress described not significant
breathing. love Brock's breathing tool, post, workout, um
Alternatives too, just mentioned, think people greatly underestimate
potency breathing shifting one's nervous system function away stress one
wants toward alertness stress. actually couple questions
sure. think audience appreciate uh. long boxes? just
user selected great question, use carbon dioxide tolerance test amazing order
people determine long different sides Box be, cover
carbon dioxide tolerance tests. previous episode, can provide link clip um
show, note captions, but, point out, involves long extended exhale lungs,
empty um and, course, people sit lungs empty, accurately
Faithfully say report long took empty lungs. use
gauge. Typically, takes, people go lungs empty 20 seconds less, believe
go back paper look, believe duration sides
boxes were, somewhere um two three seconds,
CO2 discard time anywhere uh 20 seconds 40 45 seconds, use it.
sides box, believe, four six seconds people
longer discard Arrow period minute more. used
box duration inhale, hold exhale, hold duration somewhere between. believe
[ Music, ], um, seven, maybe eight long 11 12 seconds yeah.
will get kind free diver types. can really this? really well
trained sort thing? don't quote exactly numbers,
approximate. line exactly done. believe it’s it’s going
close within seconds non-important Distinction. it’s going close enough,
that’s great, uh. took six weeks. study done


period month swapped new pattern breathing um,
condition meditation condition - done natural world, say, um
wearing whoop bands. getting heart rate, heart rate, variability, sleep,
data, subjective data mood Etc. lot measures, um
100 subjects wild life um tried best track life, stress
events exercise, things like harder control outside laboratory.
Really results speak exactly exactly describing here,
deliberate respiration involves controlled holds exhales really dramatic
immediate impact reducing levels stress. That’s wonderful! not surprised
findings really interesting that, mentioned
exhalation portion primarily responsible regulation that’s actually goes
back previous endurance conversation, general rest, non-altitude
increases Co2 primary driver ventilation, generally means
inhales associated uptick sympathetic State exhales associated
uptick parasympathetic State. generally, folks will things like exhale
finish exhale right perform high Precision, neurological tasks.
going say, aim Target shoot going Exhale fully almost
always execute movement end exhale, that’s
highest parasympathetic State lowest drive ventilation. say not surprised
guys found actually data point individuals, particularly
endurance. Training can get back Baseline heart rate going
correlated with. gets actual results training. Said take
bunch individuals put endurance training program,
measure quickly can get back Baseline workout general,
folks better going see greater improvements Performance
end say, four six eight week, training block little bit
causation correlation untie. think it’s enough say: hey
invest three case study five minutes. It’s going
enhance recovery, likelihood increasing results training, now
also additional benefits like able transition appropriately next
task, going work going see family whatever thing is, it’s it’s nice close to,
asked high, sympathetic State body, asked perform
stress. gave recovery now ready transition next thing
don't take exercise energy. will next

01:03:39 Tool: Alleviate Acute Soreness, Compression Clothing



task may may not want sympathetic Drive state. somebody sore
following workout, either locally sore muscle, group group muscles, maybe
legs chest torso maybe whole body sore sometimes case.
tools can Implement order accelerate the? want call
moving soreness, it’s really, know, alleviation soreness
bunch different processes. effective tools push back
soreness dissipate yeah? Absolutely. First all, it’s not lactate! That’s just really
important thing still hear people talk about. know sore 24 hours later
got thing get lactate there, talked metabolism,
uh conversation episode not cause fatigue it’s certainly not
cause soreness. not actionable tip there, just pet peeve mine. hear
people say get irritated can maybe end conversation um strategies,
tools, can do, can actually wear compression gear will help little
bit. decent amount evidence, suggesting, just you, know, put
tighter fitting clothes Leisure, wear compression gear. can
actually prevent little bit soreness occurring. case poor
Natasha - realize just done way way much went hung
bow hunting friend trained way hard, realize, oh, goodness,
going sore here. can immediately put compression gear weigh
really long possible. examples compression gear? seen
people plane high high socks um, mean anything wear
compression gear exercise. whether just know,
compression pants leggings tight fitting leggings uh, whether long sleeve
shirt, that’s like rash guard, wear know Jiu, Jitsu surfing, something
like that. long it’s tight fitting, doesn't much can wear.
suppose get socks, great, generally just tell leads them.
put long sleeve compression shirts wear training
long, compression, leggings that'd fine. Can people apply compression
um Garb training still get positive effects yeah? not seen
evidence suggest block adaptation. may case. not aware
studies happens, certainly know information suggests can
hands little bit Muscle Recovery. ideally one knows workout
trigger lot soreness yeah compression gear sort
offset that, local muscle groups working
Reason asked socks understanding. socks uh, compression


socks people plane it’s going shift patterns blood flow, not just
lower legs, body yeah you're, probably going want focus
actual exercising tissue, though, Actually, that’s really good question. don't know
answer whether not upper body workout lower body compression
gear. actually help that’s great question. may done. don't know,
don't know answer general, just tell people like where, whole
thing much can um, actually not concerned wearing
workout. something put afterwards even wear just little bit
compression day. Um actually really fun study. Uh. collaborated
um Bill Kramer who's. Uh, know, Sports scientist Year award. bill Cramer
award, gives indication uh University Connecticut, well Lee
Brown, two Lifetime Achievement Award winners put people plane
stores, Connecticut flew Cal State Fullerton. cross-country flight
got wear compression gear flight others not,
landed California training bout put back plane, went back stores
think another training bout got back there. lot data
came paper, one things clear compression group
effective handling blood related coagulation issues associated
long flights particularly athletic performance. that’s actually sneaky little Insider trick
use lot people, particularly athletes traveling, just wear
compression gear plane. talked sort rung study
mind another effective strategy, compression gear general, well
particularly plane, basically tighter can get better, without obviously
making hands purple uncomfortable things like that, doesn't
overly tight. Anything will work probably help. also personally,
anytime, taking

01:08:27 Tool: Acute Soreness, Massage, Temperature

flight like much can just feel little better get there.
methods can use alleviate acute soreness? Well, continue
theme, saying okay, use sort pressure manipulation
enhance recovery. compression one strategy, can also use things like compression
boots garments, nomadic devices will know, pump uh air outside
compress back forth. number devices will this. can


also use physical hand, massage body work they're, really
working best. can tell mechanisms effectively moving fluid
tissue, well potentially enhancing blood flow, increasing capitalization
going get nutrients waste products out. can kind pick
choose based upon budget preferences availability timing, things like that,
effective strategies outside really next largest category, now
thermal uh, far discussion, mentioned cold water, Immersion
talked hypertrophy section not want immediately: post
exercise, getting cold water ice bath trying grow muscle
mass. said that, good evidence showing cold water immersion
specifically effective reducing muscle soreness. fair consideration it’s
classic example no free passes physiology. Nothing always good
always bad. It’s always willing give versus willing
get case like cold water immersion? may thinking yeah. might want
hypertrophic adaptations, phase training,
actually trying push towards optimization moment, rather long-term
adaptation, ice bath might great choice. addition, fall scenario
like Natasha - realize like just unbelievably sore - might cost three
four five six days training. might worth accelerate recovery
process couple days don't miss much training. it’s just it’s
algorithm, it’s equation. looking season trying compete
just done way way much exercise, really significant pain.
probably willing give small percentage eventual muscle growth
single session get pain cold strategies. Cold water immersion clearly
best approach rather cold air tactics. cold shower probably
not enough here. really want either moderately cold. maybe 40 50
degree, water probably north 15 minutes can sub 40 little maybe
five minutes get fact number studies um.
sort summarizing bunch kind one rather going Point
point. numbers just threw uh, assuming um uh Fahrenheit um,
seem seem really cold right uncomfortably cold. Absolutely always recommend
people ease protocol overall not immediately go 35 degree uh
cold water, never done uh. said, people comfortable
uncomfortable, always answer question: cold exactly?
agree very, cold much really really want get out,
able stay safely? Whatever value happens be, absolutely


need safe. said that, actually, xbt Retreats, put dozens, not
hundreds people point, uh immediately sub 35 degree water first time
ever done. know three minutes multiple rounds session, can handle it.
don't need go crazy. don't want kind play game right,
want really really cold short amount time, want like kind
cold longer amount time? really mistake can make
something like know, 65 degree water people not comfortable
know five ten minutes. It’s just not going be. It’s probably not going
effective. like man 35 is, absolutely crazy want 55 degree, water
literature area. it’s going say need probably
somewhere, almost really north 10 minutes, will actually show need
like well north 20 30 minutes. money rather go really really
cold get done five minutes, um personal preference one. can also
make little bit easier yourself. not nearly much evidence,
contrast. Stuff uh, go cold, hot sort back forth.
no really good rules terms much go, many rounds, long
cold long hot couple studies obviously
studies use numbers, doesn't mean tested See optimal,
big difference, can really just kind play feel hot good
Recovery. just careful going put blood flow
area, may walk additional acute swelling isn't going
put greater pressure there. kind play that. personally really like
hot Recovery. will feel - maybe not great moment, next day tend feel
really really good. addition, wake next morning really really hurting
super stiff, hot bath will help um quite bit, can play
protocols. Again, don't

01:14:21 Cold & Heat Contrast, Cold Shower vs. Immersion, Sauna & Fertility

nice absolutely no requirement so. just option interested
studies Dr Susanna soberg sure yeah not directly aimed alleviating soreness
recovery, increasing thermal capacity storage uh Brown adipose
tissue, not blubbery fat stuff around clavicles around heart help
generate body, heat rest metabolism on, numbers um
come not tested possible derivations just like


breathing. five minute sessions, knows? Maybe minute
equally effective. just constraints sorts studies, values
come with, seem good thresholds making sure
adaptation response triggered heat cold. ends 57 minutes per week,
total uncomfortable safe heat case sauna, can one session
breaking couple sessions day different days, 11
minutes per week. cold either one single session multiple sessions, one
um one break know multiple days one day
one. know hour sauna 11 minutes colder vice versa,
although seems little bit extreme, especially uninitiated.
numbers studied. point out, not lot really thorough
studies examining different cold protocols according temperature time requirements.
bit subjective, feel required establish routine, actually say
another time re-emphasize something. talked beginning
conversation, pain not defined outcome. It’s heavily influenced
perception, so, don't feel like work you, won't work. feel like
work fantastic, so. It’s challenging field get really objective data
always going little bit subjective nature. things, can tell
anecdotally: used hot cold contrast long time athletes. love
don't care everything between. it’s one things never
mandate it. course, can't mandate anything anyone work with, never
know like hey. interested great struggling area? want try this?
liked great struggling area, tried it. didn't love it.
Okay, fine, not find routes, will get lot ways enhance
recovery um. one hasn't even really come stopping problem
first place, not just treating symptoms, first line defense,
really need go back figure it’s happening begin with, Solution,
just different acute symptom management tactics. One final point uh,
deliberate, cold exposure. think worth mentioning one reasons shower
effective, not nearly effective cold water, immersion immersion ice
neck simply reason stated before, showers not
going get cold not going get know sub 40s. Also cold
showers haven't really studied much have, not nearly much
immersion people always ask just think challenges studying cold water
exposure shower, can't really control mango? much body
covered, whether not head stays different size bodies, Etc? Whereas


people come laboratory, can get cold large, know neck
is. know chin can make sure people's arms um legs
underneath, cold shower sure can make everyone face away toward
shower, it’s really tricky um variations described. said,
agree one wants use deliberate cold exposure, cold shower better
nothing cold immersion circulating, cold water ice bath better um
cold shower yeah? actually say looking recovery muscle soreness,
say cold shower, probably little, not going able
get enough cold water onto muscle, besides, basically head, maybe
try cold bath least get surface area coverage, yeah want
use cold shower awesome reasons cold shower. That’s totally great.
trying use recover low back glutes sore training
good way, it’s probably not going much immersion there.
actually also hit sneaky point, is, can't get water super cold, just
make water move. Jets stuff can turn anyone tried
like. Okay, can 40 degree. Bath awesome, try 60, water
moving right, break thermal layer. Normally little thin layer
water heating up. break up. It’s whole new world, yeah, absolutely
still cold. Water actually weaker way go correct can make
face stoic, make body circulate water around long
this. Maybe just one point heat uh: certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry,
sauna, steam saunas. Excuse me, jacuzzis can work pretty well yep um uh males.
looking conceive 60 days following uh uh following sauna um, hot tub realize
approaches severely limit number motile sperm um
substantially. people not trying conceive uh. Don'T think works
reliably enough, use form contraception yeah, people
trying conceive. really detrimental sperm Health right reason
people bring ice pack put groin near groin go
um, hard hot tub sauna. getting fine points,
um crude points, will pun intended, um, idea wouldn't want
anyone approach techniques compromise life goals, certainly not
allowed anywhere near things. uh, stage Life, just say
Natasha put x hanging Laird. reasons, like you're, not
going you're, not going none stuff, just wait right heat um heat


sperm relationship it’s not one that’s positive sperm


01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques

ways combine various types stimuli described inducing
recovery? talked breathing based tools which, adjust indeed
adjust oxygen carbon dioxide ratios Etc. guessing major effect
recovery going neural. It’s going deliberate, calm nervous system,
sympathetic, based uh, mentioned, yeah definitely, talked
movement based touch-based approaches. Um, will uh movement
circulate, certainly will circulate blood, also will generate contractions muscles yep
right, maybe, if, indeed again, still speculates you, indeed soreness
due excessive stretch swelling stretch, ends muscles
make sense movement touch thermal, ways combine
um effective maybe even synergistic yeah. suppose throw uh
compression garments put Pneumatic compression device sit sauna.
regulate breath like fine. Quite honestly, though,
probably don't need maximize them. joking. probably go
light swim regulating breathing cold water. get compression
cold, water good spot, certainly that. reality
is. generally look physical approach holistic approach breath
work. Basically, want breath something else knock two things
good spot, breath thermal stress, just
controlling unregulation stuff. also remember ice stressor
actually show data second actually can enhance
systemic recovery, although won't happen acute minutes. fact, it’s going
take least 30 60 minutes eventually see rebound effect, acutely it’s
going make actually sympathetic, going direction. can
opposite can actually drive up. it’s little bit dependent upon
respond, time day you're, using general, guess combining
need um, depending available. perhaps don't
sauna, can take hot bath great. Maybe percussion device
tool can use that. don't sauna amazing. don't ice bath


things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

exercise performance Dr Andy Galpin always thank interest
science [Music]


Cadence given movement, Etc. specific types triggers adaptation relate
specific maybe similar types recovery required us make progress
one previous episodes. talking Harvard fatigue lab really
identified idea homeostasis least sort championed that’s important
levels physiology wants return homeostasis. happens terms
adaptation? challenged level realizes? not make change,
will not able get back level homeostasis. That’s fundamentally
happening. recovery, process taking insult temporarily reduced
functionality, causing change now come back get often call
support performance super compensation. really doing, though, bringing
new level homeostasis effectively. understanding insult comes again.
need able make sure doesn't cause level disruption,
raise bar whether enhancing ability take level mechanical
tension muscle not result micro damage. Whether able take
reduction energy not compromise sleep anything, it’s really
fundamentally changing. can new level homeostasis, it’s
presuming it’s predicting insult going come road.
wanted clarify people Dr Galvin says insult may actually insult me,
um insult nerd speak terminology sort damage inflicted tissue
system. um speaking insult muscle insult neuromuscular
connection, created adding weight bar running distance um running
bit fast pedaling faster. creates micro insult insult. now,
everyone familiar um, psychological verbal insults, never forget
biological concept, it’s important. tag another thing here, called hormesis. It’s
one favorite phenomenon, effectively means dosage
toxicity, responds almost everything. think context say
drugs, means is, gave 10 milligrams something okay,
give 20 it'd problem eventually, go give enough, thing
turns toxic: case everything cyanide, can actually small
dosages nature. fact, it’s many fruits eat, it’s not dosage,
doesn't matter dosage gets higher, though actually can cause problems,
high enough, can actually kill instantaneously. back end that, though,
introduce micro insult framed perfectly, body will
adapt it, that’s really happening exercise adaptation is, hormetic
stressor that’s important is, look immediate responses exercise
see extremely large increase inflammation, see, oxidative stress, see whole


Cascade autophagy, like problems quote unquote happening. It’s actually
quite funny. is, part PhD, academic portion. go
medical side school, physiology class med school,
non-medical doctor class right, PhD. leave lab. walk across
campus take physiology class folks died whole time internally,
every time cover new area, basically exact value
number medical setting like. Oh, gosh they're, going die performance
setting like person's fantastic shape. I've? Never still amuses day,
obviously, it’s just simple things like total blood volume right cover like
okay, patient come blood volume six liters, know can
immediately get diuretic sort going heart attack
blood pressure gets right now, immediately thinking damn six leaders
person super fit actually positive adaptation training it’s one
important, not important Adaptation endurance training enhance, total
blood volume, store blood body fit less
fit. mean go things. Sodium concentrations - potassium
concentrations like look things paper don't know person
die 65 years old shape person going break
world record marathon. brings important tangent, uh,
instance, go take blood test - somebody exercises
intensely uh resistance training, blood creatinine levels can way range,
physician doesn't know certain forms exercise might say:
wow, lot muscle tissue damage occurring body yeah, mentioned
before, total blood volume is, dangerously High, fact, far healthier
need much fitter person who, numbers range, said,
obviously um limits statements, whereby want
cautious take action ameliorate, elevated blood, creatinine level something
sort. point bringing also one field medicine,
many, not all, many Physicians don't take consideration uh outside
activities people doing, becomes kind plug-and-play type, um type
Way looking blood charts, yeah done many thousand athletes, blood chemistry
uh. don't use. First all, never look disease stuff, that’s not do.
take people healthy try optimize performance blood. Chemistry one
best tools. really understand there, can get
incredibly powerful information blood chemistry actually relates
going talk today terms measuring everything acute Chronic dehydration


sleep, deprivation can identified blood Chemistry optimization improvements
nutrition, supplementation lot can get there. people interested field,
Point gentleman named Dan Garner. just absolute Juggernaut
wizard blood chemistry high performance, well can get ton information
that. understand difference exactly talked about. Looking
signals increased risk cardiovascular events, 25 years road versus, this:
optimal value high performance athlete, database
software stuff does, looking things. going talk
biomarkers look little

00:30:20 Recovery Timescales, Adaptation & Optimization

Bit later salivary blood stuff, maybe save part conversation
road. Tell different time scales recovery. Sure actually
trying answer question got way off track, reason
brought Hermetic thing is: understand things acute say, 24
40 hour period, look terrible. It’s actually fine right, stimuli, that’s causing
adaptation. reason brought medical exchange you,
looked inflammatory markers mentioned them, see
highest acute within seconds minutes hours exercise. However, that’s
exactly stimuli needed bring chronically, okay chronically meaning.
Maybe moment elevated maybe coming 24 hours later
48 hours. However, compare resting level say Monday,
worked resting level, Monday week following week following that,
probably see Baseline inflammation goes down, got
really careful. talking immediately post-exercise man, markers look terrible?
Maybe recovery score awful, Etc. That’s not necessarily bad thing,
like looking not change happening today, trying
cause adaptation may take us weeks months actually access. love
highlighting principle, one obvious ones now said
heart rate. Absolutely. heart rate goes very, high exercise,
fairly consistently even semi-consistently. resting heart rate will actually quite bit
lower. That’s fantastic example! Really getting concept,
think it’s important differentiate adaptation optimization. Now hear
word use scientists hate it, it’s good communication tool, optimization


optimizing current moment, almost surely compromising late
adaptation right. If, say, thing right now makes feel absolute
best world like great, took nap donut like awesome,
feel amazing, know it’s causing long-term issues. can said
back end, never choosing things make better right now, never
actually going see adaptation. really recovery
conversation playing game balancing immediate gratification leg
gratification, identify much now versus not? use value
marker? Whether tired feel today, sore today versus score
app tracking metric, blood marker, anything understand. that’s
need cause adaptation, want week month, three months now
case athletes, it’s even four years right, trying cause
adaptations will get us want get Olympics World Championships
World Cup, wherever going that’s framework, think
recovery. maybe falsely think need maximize recovery today
something like taken anti-inflammatory, whether supplementation
drug, maybe ice. Oh cool, that’s great! will enhance recovery
moment. That'Ll make feel better today, probably tomorrow, know
blocks signal adaptation, not going get results. know four
six, eight weeks now. talk recovery, understand tool
am. using order that, understand training
trying maximize middle season athlete
competing tomorrow, going head towards Acute recovery right
actuate performance right now, starting off season, not hedging towards
recovery, actually hedging towards adaptation, not going deploy these,
especially things like evidence combination vitamin C vitamin E will
blunt hypertrophic adaptations anti-inflammatory antioxidants right
Studies shown? Maybe don't uh inhibitory fact may may not
point conceptually. want careful trying optimize for,
forethought alone going dictate decision making
whether not get eyes uh now will cover tools, Like
massage pretty fine use, don't worry blocking

00:35:10 Adaptation & Biomarkers Levels



Long-Term adaptation, others going want careful
principle laid us, set events occur
exercise trigger adaptation sets motion number adaptations
occur recovery give us exact opposite response trigger
go back heart rate example: um heart rate close maximal maximal.
enough times within short know week two weeks resting
heart rate goes down. recall episodes ago, said maximum heart rate
doesn't really change. much. correct? Yes, okay, resting heart rate can
go quite bit yep. general theme meaning less set
upper limit ceiling things like inflammatory markers heart rate, maybe even things
like stress deliberately trigger stress dramatic increase
heart rate dramatic Increase inflammatory markers lowering floor,
ceiling Remains Same. It’s dependent upon marker, case
maximum heart rate, will not change exception one thing age, brings
down. Training will not change circumstances. look something like
inflammatory response, suppose, theoretically, ceiling, though not aware
um. can tell right now, looking blood markers, things like creatine kinase,
remember conversation metabolism use phosphocreatine
one primary fuel sources explosive exercise. Well, using phosphocreatine
creatine kinase, remember, kinase enzymes function break things
part, creatine kinase enzyme use break creatine
that. lot, creatine kinase gets muscle seeps blood
myoglobin actually another fantastic marker. way, myoglobin is, think
hemoglobin blood, molecule carries oxygen around it’s
muscle tissue. it’s myoglobin mild, meaning muscle it’s globulin thing.
bunch markers can look muscle breakdown one things
can see creatine kinase level. That’s elevated say, um, one bout exercise and,
might, might up. know five six-fold. actually seen number
offensive lineman NFL, something like 500 plus fold, even within just one
category next. number can get extraordinarily high know actually
one important Point here, paying attention mechanistic research
use you're, using inform decision making, extraordinarily careful
magnitude Mean is, running western blot looking
signaling protein um muscle uh activation protein turn mitochondrial
biogenesis, saw whatever intervention gave it, whether nutrition thing
drug exercise - saw signaling protein increased 20 percent.


basically assume totally physiologically irrelevant, order
important, totally depends market looking at, markers
might need see four five six hundred fold increase before. know will actually
enough call physiologically relevant others one two percent
relevant, really want careful either reading papers
looking Social Media stuff. people just talking this, marker increase much,
may not matter, may totally irrelevant physiologically,
also, wondering like hell are, people. Well, that’s can
trick little bit intentionally not. just trying best,
don't really understand area enough, that’s important point pay attention to.
So. answer question fully, hard determine truly
maximum level um. things don't want move like blood pH. doesn't really want
move range going move from, know like 6.8 7.4, get
like 7.9, like you're, probably big big big trouble, things can go 500 5 000
fold, markers will really determine answer well point future.
love continue discussion around topic stress, specifically yeah um,
maybe will get little bit later today um get use deliberate
cold exposure, that’s certainly um effects related directly temperature
tissue. certainly mental effects terms raising one's level perceived pain. It’s
fun um, people love people love feeling get it.
Um deliberate cold exposure. people like feeling get not
unlike exercise totally. love train. love exercise, know many people uh um.
loathe exercise, love feeling afterward. will theme will
come back to. Thank indulging interest

00:40:36 4 Recovery Levels, Enhance Recovery

semi-tangent, think it’s relevant tangent thing, can now return
us different time, scales, yeah modes recovery, think
headed get better recovery. Yep. talk tools, talk
measure identify four distinct levels, level one call
overload just quickly means is. workout today. sign
symptom overload fatigued. Acute performance down, worked hard right
now. go, try maximum effort, reduced ability.
recovery period acute overload minutes days right. That’s generally, call


acute overload that’s looking right. systems theoretically
see hormetic stressor come back response, come back, bigger, better, efficient,
Etc. continue training state, like us, say workout
today, little bit acute overload going work tomorrow. little acute
overload can work next day little acute overload. Even took day
it’s doesn't matter right, just continue acute bouts insult
going pushing absolute golden Target, call functional
overreaching. reached can currently results
functional outcome, mean functionally performance enhanced
performance whatever deem stronger, you've, enhanced
muscle size, mitochondria improved you've, whatever thing is, it’s not just
physical performance thing right, amazing, recovery time functional overreaching
typically days maybe even week so, typically, see happen
prior competition. Individuals will call taper, reduced training
volume short period time, reason do. again.
Actualize phrase year adaptations, worked hard six
weeks know, theoretically, workouts. three four five six weeks ago,
allow, system recover will actualized, means performance will
enhanced. functional overreaching golden Target. Okay,
point functional overreaching - continue train intensified whether
intensity volume really. said earlier, something
holding back recovery. doesn't really matter right. It’s it’s sort two sides
coin. move call non-functional overreaching
reached again, now non-functional not see positive benefit
recovery allowed. typically means weeks takes weeks come back from,
basically just get back Baseline, lot folks end
vicious cycle, like man, not getting results. want. going train
harder, not getting results. want going train harder harder,
caught recovery isn't improved, just end spot. train
end spot end up. just either blowing quitting
not getting want. continue past point, may
actually actually call training typically, considered
trained takes months recover people think trained really
not you're. Just probably non-functionally overreached classic distinction is,
took three four days off felt better, weren't, probably quote unquote
trained. probably just area non-functional reaching. need little bit


back off - case. happen gymnasts
cheerleader things take month off barely seeing
start come back Baseline numbers. number areas, mood desire
train testosterone, cortisol ratios biomarkers number areas - physical performance,
vertical jump height, like things just start get back Baseline, true
training actually quite rare. Non-Functional overreaching much common
shorter time frame scale. talk recovery, four pieces
really thinking about, so, concerned about, oh super sore.
get less sore? either not sore next time? workout
super sorry. Now. recover playing first category overload
can certainly talk figure out. quick answer got go back
previous episodes just pay attention volume intensity recommendations
getting significantly uh damage fatigue workout? probably
increased volume quickly, something else dragging stress bucket down,
generally, problem training. Um either didn't warm sufficiently.
fueling strategy off talk Next Episode violated. One
principles increasing intensity volume sort quickly, it’s past
getting stage you're, just like feeling beat time energy going
down, just not feeling like recovered. Now overreaching stage,
story kind tell always years ago working wife Natasha
garage training something like comes stumbling
look Eyes like eyeballs, giant she's, just like wobbling she's.
Like effed up, like mean like effed she's? Just like, read
program wrong like Trump like what'd. like supposed
10 sets three every minute minute three sets ten every minute
minute absolutely wrecked. couldn't move hours afterwards
days, she's. Just like handle kids like, can't get bed.
can't move like classic example right like don't need fix recovery
here, you're, just dummy, dream way hard long like not
don't problem here. it’s situation like that, it’s generally just program
way off. it’s constantly happening you're, just like man like whatever reason,
every while, getting really sore really bad performance
workouts, need go stress bucket. Take look allostatic load
allostasis get figured happening um.




00:48:19 Overreaching vs. Overtraining

happy pointed distinction functional overreaching, training
trained. think one one common mistake people make thinking
biology generally think terms nouns adjectives not verbs amazing.
love much know, biology collection processes processes depending
live, trained trained state that,
many ways, adjective trained trained. It’s like saying, uh,
know American, know Czechoslovakian whatever happens, right
many ways people start associate identity, least transient identity,
start making sorts decisions. sounds like sorts verbs will
will not engage in, whereas think look things processes assign verbs
them, can say: okay, functionally overreaching truly training,
matter Degrees, correct right training matter, not reaching,
not functionally reaching it’s just it’s just performance, know, just
nervous system, won't change unless give reason reason why,
can Perform something perfectly speak language perfectly. no rewiring
nervous system. myth told every experience rewires
nervous system, it’s different now two seconds ago. That’s that’s ridiculous,
illogical statement. know. That’s not true nervous system can perform something,
no reason change won't muscles way.
progressively overload learn something new challenge muscle
something new, it’s thing. example gave uh wife
workout turned far strenuous, functionally overreach.
sense, might training heading direction training,
mistake assume trained right, kind it’s almost becomes
bit state character assignment um, opposed verb, case,
no perfect way describe - talking nouns adjectives also
um talking verbs. think verbs really anchored processes
things actions can take um. may, like just highlight this,
idea shifting one sinking towards verb actions rather labels state
happen person happen right. Sometimes even become
kind character. Logical way people describe uh, believe
something called training training real words,
don't ever really know trained, nailed it. there's. No, know it’s
not like red flag. Uh, know shoots shoulder say trained.


know it’s um, so, hope can start thinking verbs,
actions can take order ensure stimulate Progressive, overload
one way another time, don't fall bins character
assignment suddenly decide need X like take month off
something like that, beginning realize um discussion that’s
exactly wrong way go. fantastic points want make sure clear
no clinical diagnosis training. no standards, no test
blood panel. can pull. actually identify state.
distinction Here, Andrew verbs, rather nouns is, wonderful
exactly case. way really come retroactively, diagnose
one training is, had. weeks recovery got back
Baseline, can't moment. can't take single test, no subjective
marker anything says trained. simply, probably training,
need reverse quickly case step probably non-
functionally overreaching. continue this, will probably enter new stage
training need come back. that’s important thing
let people know no one thing actually point says

00:52:53 Tool: Acute Overload & Recovery, Breathwork

not noun, verb. tools can use
enhance recovery yep? start off acute overload phase. So, words,
just workout feeling awful just one two days ago super sore.
get rid right now? Well, couple things can immediately
workout others maybe actionable day later two days
later just cover handful them. nutrition hydration
supplementation next episode. going cover everything else, not category
right now, couple things number one. can actually start Kickstart recovery
process end current training session, guess say way.
strongly suggest start recovery process immediately workout
mentioned earlier idea got get really high peak stress cause
adaptation, actually didn't explain correctly, happen
need extremely High peak, met extremely sharp
recovery back down, know talked
neuroplasticity stuff terms happen caused insult.


immediately need able recover make sure causes changes brains
thing happens here. need really sharp high inflammatory response
then, not meet immediate recovery period, signal won't
maximize results. mean can actually couple things? Number
one actually listening slow, paced, music evidence suggest fast-paced music
may slow recovery slow pace actually enhance it. just change
know maximum get get going music workout
slower, lower Cadence will help kick start idea similar note. can also
use call regulation breathing. conjunction one
other, whichever you, personal favorite method somewhere
three ten minutes finishing training session. Laying like
position, certainly Lotus position, think laying back
generally effective personal preference there, no science, like items
covered getting dark quiet sort area Then, just breathing nose
structured, Cadence, lot different things. can try easy example. just
box breathing can imagine box four squares. going
inhale somewhere between, like three eight seconds whatever number
choose, keep tempo, say chose five second inhale,
that’s going take vertically horizontally box five second hold
five second exhale five second hold, just need repeat
time domain. Now typically honestly don't use timer you'll, actually notice. lot
people will like fall asleep get really close falling asleep period. can
triangle version that, inhale, hold exhale go right back
inhale bunch different tricks. can try here, need play around
see actually works best you. Um 10 minutes probably better, can just
least give three that'll work, really really resistant, can actually that. Just
shower, going finish workout get shower again, just close
eyes shower, give three minutes focused relaxation breathing will
accelerate recovery process. love particularly love laboratory
works stress respiration, okay, breathing interactions two
just mention result just accepted publication, time day.
uh. Thank you. Uh beautiful work uh, not directly, although took
place lab, know, it’s students doctors um, Dr Melise uh, balbon
uh lab. It’s phenomenal researcher showed short period five minutes
box breathing exactly type described cyclic sign two inhales, followed
extended exhale lungs empty. Ideally, inhales done nose.


exhales done. Uh mouth, although done nose, um
mouth matter, probably nose. Nose inhale, inhale mouth exhale
um uh inhales, nose exhale nose. Cyclic sighing,
refer done five minutes, produce significant decreases resting
heart rate. time will increase things like heart rate, variability
forth. Um provided extended exhales. seems like calming response,
reduction overall stress occurs. thing really sends things
direction something like cyclic hyperventilation. sure observed um
interestingly uh, people just five minutes meditation which,
which, course, breathing just allowing breathing progress.
However, happens moment, um moments across five minutes uh.
reductions sorts markers stress described not significant
breathing. love Brock's breathing tool, post, workout, um
Alternatives too, just mentioned, think people greatly underestimate
potency breathing shifting one's nervous system function away stress one
wants toward alertness stress. actually couple questions
sure. think audience appreciate uh. long boxes? just
user selected great question, use carbon dioxide tolerance test amazing order
people determine long different sides Box be, cover
carbon dioxide tolerance tests. previous episode, can provide link clip um
show, note captions, but, point out, involves long extended exhale lungs,
empty um and, course, people sit lungs empty, accurately
Faithfully say report long took empty lungs. use
gauge. Typically, takes, people go lungs empty 20 seconds less, believe
go back paper look, believe duration sides
boxes were, somewhere um two three seconds,
CO2 discard time anywhere uh 20 seconds 40 45 seconds, use it.
sides box, believe, four six seconds people
longer discard Arrow period minute more. used
box duration inhale, hold exhale, hold duration somewhere between. believe
[ Music, ], um, seven, maybe eight long 11 12 seconds yeah.
will get kind free diver types. can really this? really well
trained sort thing? don't quote exactly numbers,
approximate. line exactly done. believe it’s it’s going
close within seconds non-important Distinction. it’s going close enough,
that’s great, uh. took six weeks. study done


period month swapped new pattern breathing um,
condition meditation condition - done natural world, say, um
wearing whoop bands. getting heart rate, heart rate, variability, sleep,
data, subjective data mood Etc. lot measures, um
100 subjects wild life um tried best track life, stress
events exercise, things like harder control outside laboratory.
Really results speak exactly exactly describing here,
deliberate respiration involves controlled holds exhales really dramatic
immediate impact reducing levels stress. That’s wonderful! not surprised
findings really interesting that, mentioned
exhalation portion primarily responsible regulation that’s actually goes
back previous endurance conversation, general rest, non-altitude
increases Co2 primary driver ventilation, generally means
inhales associated uptick sympathetic State exhales associated
uptick parasympathetic State. generally, folks will things like exhale
finish exhale right perform high Precision, neurological tasks.
going say, aim Target shoot going Exhale fully almost
always execute movement end exhale, that’s
highest parasympathetic State lowest drive ventilation. say not surprised
guys found actually data point individuals, particularly
endurance. Training can get back Baseline heart rate going
correlated with. gets actual results training. Said take
bunch individuals put endurance training program,
measure quickly can get back Baseline workout general,
folks better going see greater improvements Performance
end say, four six eight week, training block little bit
causation correlation untie. think it’s enough say: hey
invest three case study five minutes. It’s going
enhance recovery, likelihood increasing results training, now
also additional benefits like able transition appropriately next
task, going work going see family whatever thing is, it’s it’s nice close to,
asked high, sympathetic State body, asked perform
stress. gave recovery now ready transition next thing
don't take exercise energy. will next

01:03:39 Tool: Alleviate Acute Soreness, Compression Clothing



task may may not want sympathetic Drive state. somebody sore
following workout, either locally sore muscle, group group muscles, maybe
legs chest torso maybe whole body sore sometimes case.
tools can Implement order accelerate the? want call
moving soreness, it’s really, know, alleviation soreness
bunch different processes. effective tools push back
soreness dissipate yeah? Absolutely. First all, it’s not lactate! That’s just really
important thing still hear people talk about. know sore 24 hours later
got thing get lactate there, talked metabolism,
uh conversation episode not cause fatigue it’s certainly not
cause soreness. not actionable tip there, just pet peeve mine. hear
people say get irritated can maybe end conversation um strategies,
tools, can do, can actually wear compression gear will help little
bit. decent amount evidence, suggesting, just you, know, put
tighter fitting clothes Leisure, wear compression gear. can
actually prevent little bit soreness occurring. case poor
Natasha - realize just done way way much went hung
bow hunting friend trained way hard, realize, oh, goodness,
going sore here. can immediately put compression gear weigh
really long possible. examples compression gear? seen
people plane high high socks um, mean anything wear
compression gear exercise. whether just know,
compression pants leggings tight fitting leggings uh, whether long sleeve
shirt, that’s like rash guard, wear know Jiu, Jitsu surfing, something
like that. long it’s tight fitting, doesn't much can wear.
suppose get socks, great, generally just tell leads them.
put long sleeve compression shirts wear training
long, compression, leggings that'd fine. Can people apply compression
um Garb training still get positive effects yeah? not seen
evidence suggest block adaptation. may case. not aware
studies happens, certainly know information suggests can
hands little bit Muscle Recovery. ideally one knows workout
trigger lot soreness yeah compression gear sort
offset that, local muscle groups working
Reason asked socks understanding. socks uh, compression


socks people plane it’s going shift patterns blood flow, not just
lower legs, body yeah you're, probably going want focus
actual exercising tissue, though, Actually, that’s really good question. don't know
answer whether not upper body workout lower body compression
gear. actually help that’s great question. may done. don't know,
don't know answer general, just tell people like where, whole
thing much can um, actually not concerned wearing
workout. something put afterwards even wear just little bit
compression day. Um actually really fun study. Uh. collaborated
um Bill Kramer who's. Uh, know, Sports scientist Year award. bill Cramer
award, gives indication uh University Connecticut, well Lee
Brown, two Lifetime Achievement Award winners put people plane
stores, Connecticut flew Cal State Fullerton. cross-country flight
got wear compression gear flight others not,
landed California training bout put back plane, went back stores
think another training bout got back there. lot data
came paper, one things clear compression group
effective handling blood related coagulation issues associated
long flights particularly athletic performance. that’s actually sneaky little Insider trick
use lot people, particularly athletes traveling, just wear
compression gear plane. talked sort rung study
mind another effective strategy, compression gear general, well
particularly plane, basically tighter can get better, without obviously
making hands purple uncomfortable things like that, doesn't
overly tight. Anything will work probably help. also personally,
anytime, taking

01:08:27 Tool: Acute Soreness, Massage, Temperature

flight like much can just feel little better get there.
methods can use alleviate acute soreness? Well, continue
theme, saying okay, use sort pressure manipulation
enhance recovery. compression one strategy, can also use things like compression
boots garments, nomadic devices will know, pump uh air outside
compress back forth. number devices will this. can


also use physical hand, massage body work they're, really
working best. can tell mechanisms effectively moving fluid
tissue, well potentially enhancing blood flow, increasing capitalization
going get nutrients waste products out. can kind pick
choose based upon budget preferences availability timing, things like that,
effective strategies outside really next largest category, now
thermal uh, far discussion, mentioned cold water, Immersion
talked hypertrophy section not want immediately: post
exercise, getting cold water ice bath trying grow muscle
mass. said that, good evidence showing cold water immersion
specifically effective reducing muscle soreness. fair consideration it’s
classic example no free passes physiology. Nothing always good
always bad. It’s always willing give versus willing
get case like cold water immersion? may thinking yeah. might want
hypertrophic adaptations, phase training,
actually trying push towards optimization moment, rather long-term
adaptation, ice bath might great choice. addition, fall scenario
like Natasha - realize like just unbelievably sore - might cost three
four five six days training. might worth accelerate recovery
process couple days don't miss much training. it’s just it’s
algorithm, it’s equation. looking season trying compete
just done way way much exercise, really significant pain.
probably willing give small percentage eventual muscle growth
single session get pain cold strategies. Cold water immersion clearly
best approach rather cold air tactics. cold shower probably
not enough here. really want either moderately cold. maybe 40 50
degree, water probably north 15 minutes can sub 40 little maybe
five minutes get fact number studies um.
sort summarizing bunch kind one rather going Point
point. numbers just threw uh, assuming um uh Fahrenheit um,
seem seem really cold right uncomfortably cold. Absolutely always recommend
people ease protocol overall not immediately go 35 degree uh
cold water, never done uh. said, people comfortable
uncomfortable, always answer question: cold exactly?
agree very, cold much really really want get out,
able stay safely? Whatever value happens be, absolutely


need safe. said that, actually, xbt Retreats, put dozens, not
hundreds people point, uh immediately sub 35 degree water first time
ever done. know three minutes multiple rounds session, can handle it.
don't need go crazy. don't want kind play game right,
want really really cold short amount time, want like kind
cold longer amount time? really mistake can make
something like know, 65 degree water people not comfortable
know five ten minutes. It’s just not going be. It’s probably not going
effective. like man 35 is, absolutely crazy want 55 degree, water
literature area. it’s going say need probably
somewhere, almost really north 10 minutes, will actually show need
like well north 20 30 minutes. money rather go really really
cold get done five minutes, um personal preference one. can also
make little bit easier yourself. not nearly much evidence,
contrast. Stuff uh, go cold, hot sort back forth.
no really good rules terms much go, many rounds, long
cold long hot couple studies obviously
studies use numbers, doesn't mean tested See optimal,
big difference, can really just kind play feel hot good
Recovery. just careful going put blood flow
area, may walk additional acute swelling isn't going
put greater pressure there. kind play that. personally really like
hot Recovery. will feel - maybe not great moment, next day tend feel
really really good. addition, wake next morning really really hurting
super stiff, hot bath will help um quite bit, can play
protocols. Again, don't

01:14:21 Cold & Heat Contrast, Cold Shower vs. Immersion, Sauna & Fertility

nice absolutely no requirement so. just option interested
studies Dr Susanna soberg sure yeah not directly aimed alleviating soreness
recovery, increasing thermal capacity storage uh Brown adipose
tissue, not blubbery fat stuff around clavicles around heart help
generate body, heat rest metabolism on, numbers um
come not tested possible derivations just like


breathing. five minute sessions, knows? Maybe minute
equally effective. just constraints sorts studies, values
come with, seem good thresholds making sure
adaptation response triggered heat cold. ends 57 minutes per week,
total uncomfortable safe heat case sauna, can one session
breaking couple sessions day different days, 11
minutes per week. cold either one single session multiple sessions, one
um one break know multiple days one day
one. know hour sauna 11 minutes colder vice versa,
although seems little bit extreme, especially uninitiated.
numbers studied. point out, not lot really thorough
studies examining different cold protocols according temperature time requirements.
bit subjective, feel required establish routine, actually say
another time re-emphasize something. talked beginning
conversation, pain not defined outcome. It’s heavily influenced
perception, so, don't feel like work you, won't work. feel like
work fantastic, so. It’s challenging field get really objective data
always going little bit subjective nature. things, can tell
anecdotally: used hot cold contrast long time athletes. love
don't care everything between. it’s one things never
mandate it. course, can't mandate anything anyone work with, never
know like hey. interested great struggling area? want try this?
liked great struggling area, tried it. didn't love it.
Okay, fine, not find routes, will get lot ways enhance
recovery um. one hasn't even really come stopping problem
first place, not just treating symptoms, first line defense,
really need go back figure it’s happening begin with, Solution,
just different acute symptom management tactics. One final point uh,
deliberate, cold exposure. think worth mentioning one reasons shower
effective, not nearly effective cold water, immersion immersion ice
neck simply reason stated before, showers not
going get cold not going get know sub 40s. Also cold
showers haven't really studied much have, not nearly much
immersion people always ask just think challenges studying cold water
exposure shower, can't really control mango? much body
covered, whether not head stays different size bodies, Etc? Whereas


people come laboratory, can get cold large, know neck
is. know chin can make sure people's arms um legs
underneath, cold shower sure can make everyone face away toward
shower, it’s really tricky um variations described. said,
agree one wants use deliberate cold exposure, cold shower better
nothing cold immersion circulating, cold water ice bath better um
cold shower yeah? actually say looking recovery muscle soreness,
say cold shower, probably little, not going able
get enough cold water onto muscle, besides, basically head, maybe
try cold bath least get surface area coverage, yeah want
use cold shower awesome reasons cold shower. That’s totally great.
trying use recover low back glutes sore training
good way, it’s probably not going much immersion there.
actually also hit sneaky point, is, can't get water super cold, just
make water move. Jets stuff can turn anyone tried
like. Okay, can 40 degree. Bath awesome, try 60, water
moving right, break thermal layer. Normally little thin layer
water heating up. break up. It’s whole new world, yeah, absolutely
still cold. Water actually weaker way go correct can make
face stoic, make body circulate water around long
this. Maybe just one point heat uh: certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry,
sauna, steam saunas. Excuse me, jacuzzis can work pretty well yep um uh males.
looking conceive 60 days following uh uh following sauna um, hot tub realize
approaches severely limit number motile sperm um
substantially. people not trying conceive uh. Don'T think works
reliably enough, use form contraception yeah, people
trying conceive. really detrimental sperm Health right reason
people bring ice pack put groin near groin go
um, hard hot tub sauna. getting fine points,
um crude points, will pun intended, um, idea wouldn't want
anyone approach techniques compromise life goals, certainly not
allowed anywhere near things. uh, stage Life, just say
Natasha put x hanging Laird. reasons, like you're, not
going you're, not going none stuff, just wait right heat um heat


sperm relationship it’s not one that’s positive sperm


01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques

ways combine various types stimuli described inducing
recovery? talked breathing based tools which, adjust indeed
adjust oxygen carbon dioxide ratios Etc. guessing major effect
recovery going neural. It’s going deliberate, calm nervous system,
sympathetic, based uh, mentioned, yeah definitely, talked
movement based touch-based approaches. Um, will uh movement
circulate, certainly will circulate blood, also will generate contractions muscles yep
right, maybe, if, indeed again, still speculates you, indeed soreness
due excessive stretch swelling stretch, ends muscles
make sense movement touch thermal, ways combine
um effective maybe even synergistic yeah. suppose throw uh
compression garments put Pneumatic compression device sit sauna.
regulate breath like fine. Quite honestly, though,
probably don't need maximize them. joking. probably go
light swim regulating breathing cold water. get compression
cold, water good spot, certainly that. reality
is. generally look physical approach holistic approach breath
work. Basically, want breath something else knock two things
good spot, breath thermal stress, just
controlling unregulation stuff. also remember ice stressor
actually show data second actually can enhance
systemic recovery, although won't happen acute minutes. fact, it’s going
take least 30 60 minutes eventually see rebound effect, acutely it’s
going make actually sympathetic, going direction. can
opposite can actually drive up. it’s little bit dependent upon
respond, time day you're, using general, guess combining
need um, depending available. perhaps don't
sauna, can take hot bath great. Maybe percussion device
tool can use that. don't sauna amazing. don't ice bath


things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

Cascade autophagy, like problems quote unquote happening. It’s actually
quite funny. is, part PhD, academic portion. go
medical side school, physiology class med school,
non-medical doctor class right, PhD. leave lab. walk across
campus take physiology class folks died whole time internally,
every time cover new area, basically exact value
number medical setting like. Oh, gosh they're, going die performance
setting like person's fantastic shape. I've? Never still amuses day,
obviously, it’s just simple things like total blood volume right cover like
okay, patient come blood volume six liters, know can
immediately get diuretic sort going heart attack
blood pressure gets right now, immediately thinking damn six leaders
person super fit actually positive adaptation training it’s one
important, not important Adaptation endurance training enhance, total
blood volume, store blood body fit less
fit. mean go things. Sodium concentrations - potassium
concentrations like look things paper don't know person
die 65 years old shape person going break
world record marathon. brings important tangent, uh,
instance, go take blood test - somebody exercises
intensely uh resistance training, blood creatinine levels can way range,
physician doesn't know certain forms exercise might say:
wow, lot muscle tissue damage occurring body yeah, mentioned
before, total blood volume is, dangerously High, fact, far healthier
need much fitter person who, numbers range, said,
obviously um limits statements, whereby want
cautious take action ameliorate, elevated blood, creatinine level something
sort. point bringing also one field medicine,
many, not all, many Physicians don't take consideration uh outside
activities people doing, becomes kind plug-and-play type, um type
Way looking blood charts, yeah done many thousand athletes, blood chemistry
uh. don't use. First all, never look disease stuff, that’s not do.
take people healthy try optimize performance blood. Chemistry one
best tools. really understand there, can get
incredibly powerful information blood chemistry actually relates
going talk today terms measuring everything acute Chronic dehydration


sleep, deprivation can identified blood Chemistry optimization improvements
nutrition, supplementation lot can get there. people interested field,
Point gentleman named Dan Garner. just absolute Juggernaut
wizard blood chemistry high performance, well can get ton information
that. understand difference exactly talked about. Looking
signals increased risk cardiovascular events, 25 years road versus, this:
optimal value high performance athlete, database
software stuff does, looking things. going talk
biomarkers look little

00:30:20 Recovery Timescales, Adaptation & Optimization

Bit later salivary blood stuff, maybe save part conversation
road. Tell different time scales recovery. Sure actually
trying answer question got way off track, reason
brought Hermetic thing is: understand things acute say, 24
40 hour period, look terrible. It’s actually fine right, stimuli, that’s causing
adaptation. reason brought medical exchange you,
looked inflammatory markers mentioned them, see
highest acute within seconds minutes hours exercise. However, that’s
exactly stimuli needed bring chronically, okay chronically meaning.
Maybe moment elevated maybe coming 24 hours later
48 hours. However, compare resting level say Monday,
worked resting level, Monday week following week following that,
probably see Baseline inflammation goes down, got
really careful. talking immediately post-exercise man, markers look terrible?
Maybe recovery score awful, Etc. That’s not necessarily bad thing,
like looking not change happening today, trying
cause adaptation may take us weeks months actually access. love
highlighting principle, one obvious ones now said
heart rate. Absolutely. heart rate goes very, high exercise,
fairly consistently even semi-consistently. resting heart rate will actually quite bit
lower. That’s fantastic example! Really getting concept,
think it’s important differentiate adaptation optimization. Now hear
word use scientists hate it, it’s good communication tool, optimization


optimizing current moment, almost surely compromising late
adaptation right. If, say, thing right now makes feel absolute
best world like great, took nap donut like awesome,
feel amazing, know it’s causing long-term issues. can said
back end, never choosing things make better right now, never
actually going see adaptation. really recovery
conversation playing game balancing immediate gratification leg
gratification, identify much now versus not? use value
marker? Whether tired feel today, sore today versus score
app tracking metric, blood marker, anything understand. that’s
need cause adaptation, want week month, three months now
case athletes, it’s even four years right, trying cause
adaptations will get us want get Olympics World Championships
World Cup, wherever going that’s framework, think
recovery. maybe falsely think need maximize recovery today
something like taken anti-inflammatory, whether supplementation
drug, maybe ice. Oh cool, that’s great! will enhance recovery
moment. That'Ll make feel better today, probably tomorrow, know
blocks signal adaptation, not going get results. know four
six, eight weeks now. talk recovery, understand tool
am. using order that, understand training
trying maximize middle season athlete
competing tomorrow, going head towards Acute recovery right
actuate performance right now, starting off season, not hedging towards
recovery, actually hedging towards adaptation, not going deploy these,
especially things like evidence combination vitamin C vitamin E will
blunt hypertrophic adaptations anti-inflammatory antioxidants right
Studies shown? Maybe don't uh inhibitory fact may may not
point conceptually. want careful trying optimize for,
forethought alone going dictate decision making
whether not get eyes uh now will cover tools, Like
massage pretty fine use, don't worry blocking

00:35:10 Adaptation & Biomarkers Levels



Long-Term adaptation, others going want careful
principle laid us, set events occur
exercise trigger adaptation sets motion number adaptations
occur recovery give us exact opposite response trigger
go back heart rate example: um heart rate close maximal maximal.
enough times within short know week two weeks resting
heart rate goes down. recall episodes ago, said maximum heart rate
doesn't really change. much. correct? Yes, okay, resting heart rate can
go quite bit yep. general theme meaning less set
upper limit ceiling things like inflammatory markers heart rate, maybe even things
like stress deliberately trigger stress dramatic increase
heart rate dramatic Increase inflammatory markers lowering floor,
ceiling Remains Same. It’s dependent upon marker, case
maximum heart rate, will not change exception one thing age, brings
down. Training will not change circumstances. look something like
inflammatory response, suppose, theoretically, ceiling, though not aware
um. can tell right now, looking blood markers, things like creatine kinase,
remember conversation metabolism use phosphocreatine
one primary fuel sources explosive exercise. Well, using phosphocreatine
creatine kinase, remember, kinase enzymes function break things
part, creatine kinase enzyme use break creatine
that. lot, creatine kinase gets muscle seeps blood
myoglobin actually another fantastic marker. way, myoglobin is, think
hemoglobin blood, molecule carries oxygen around it’s
muscle tissue. it’s myoglobin mild, meaning muscle it’s globulin thing.
bunch markers can look muscle breakdown one things
can see creatine kinase level. That’s elevated say, um, one bout exercise and,
might, might up. know five six-fold. actually seen number
offensive lineman NFL, something like 500 plus fold, even within just one
category next. number can get extraordinarily high know actually
one important Point here, paying attention mechanistic research
use you're, using inform decision making, extraordinarily careful
magnitude Mean is, running western blot looking
signaling protein um muscle uh activation protein turn mitochondrial
biogenesis, saw whatever intervention gave it, whether nutrition thing
drug exercise - saw signaling protein increased 20 percent.


basically assume totally physiologically irrelevant, order
important, totally depends market looking at, markers
might need see four five six hundred fold increase before. know will actually
enough call physiologically relevant others one two percent
relevant, really want careful either reading papers
looking Social Media stuff. people just talking this, marker increase much,
may not matter, may totally irrelevant physiologically,
also, wondering like hell are, people. Well, that’s can
trick little bit intentionally not. just trying best,
don't really understand area enough, that’s important point pay attention to.
So. answer question fully, hard determine truly
maximum level um. things don't want move like blood pH. doesn't really want
move range going move from, know like 6.8 7.4, get
like 7.9, like you're, probably big big big trouble, things can go 500 5 000
fold, markers will really determine answer well point future.
love continue discussion around topic stress, specifically yeah um,
maybe will get little bit later today um get use deliberate
cold exposure, that’s certainly um effects related directly temperature
tissue. certainly mental effects terms raising one's level perceived pain. It’s
fun um, people love people love feeling get it.
Um deliberate cold exposure. people like feeling get not
unlike exercise totally. love train. love exercise, know many people uh um.
loathe exercise, love feeling afterward. will theme will
come back to. Thank indulging interest

00:40:36 4 Recovery Levels, Enhance Recovery

semi-tangent, think it’s relevant tangent thing, can now return
us different time, scales, yeah modes recovery, think
headed get better recovery. Yep. talk tools, talk
measure identify four distinct levels, level one call
overload just quickly means is. workout today. sign
symptom overload fatigued. Acute performance down, worked hard right
now. go, try maximum effort, reduced ability.
recovery period acute overload minutes days right. That’s generally, call


acute overload that’s looking right. systems theoretically
see hormetic stressor come back response, come back, bigger, better, efficient,
Etc. continue training state, like us, say workout
today, little bit acute overload going work tomorrow. little acute
overload can work next day little acute overload. Even took day
it’s doesn't matter right, just continue acute bouts insult
going pushing absolute golden Target, call functional
overreaching. reached can currently results
functional outcome, mean functionally performance enhanced
performance whatever deem stronger, you've, enhanced
muscle size, mitochondria improved you've, whatever thing is, it’s not just
physical performance thing right, amazing, recovery time functional overreaching
typically days maybe even week so, typically, see happen
prior competition. Individuals will call taper, reduced training
volume short period time, reason do. again.
Actualize phrase year adaptations, worked hard six
weeks know, theoretically, workouts. three four five six weeks ago,
allow, system recover will actualized, means performance will
enhanced. functional overreaching golden Target. Okay,
point functional overreaching - continue train intensified whether
intensity volume really. said earlier, something
holding back recovery. doesn't really matter right. It’s it’s sort two sides
coin. move call non-functional overreaching
reached again, now non-functional not see positive benefit
recovery allowed. typically means weeks takes weeks come back from,
basically just get back Baseline, lot folks end
vicious cycle, like man, not getting results. want. going train
harder, not getting results. want going train harder harder,
caught recovery isn't improved, just end spot. train
end spot end up. just either blowing quitting
not getting want. continue past point, may
actually actually call training typically, considered
trained takes months recover people think trained really
not you're. Just probably non-functionally overreached classic distinction is,
took three four days off felt better, weren't, probably quote unquote
trained. probably just area non-functional reaching. need little bit


back off - case. happen gymnasts
cheerleader things take month off barely seeing
start come back Baseline numbers. number areas, mood desire
train testosterone, cortisol ratios biomarkers number areas - physical performance,
vertical jump height, like things just start get back Baseline, true
training actually quite rare. Non-Functional overreaching much common
shorter time frame scale. talk recovery, four pieces
really thinking about, so, concerned about, oh super sore.
get less sore? either not sore next time? workout
super sorry. Now. recover playing first category overload
can certainly talk figure out. quick answer got go back
previous episodes just pay attention volume intensity recommendations
getting significantly uh damage fatigue workout? probably
increased volume quickly, something else dragging stress bucket down,
generally, problem training. Um either didn't warm sufficiently.
fueling strategy off talk Next Episode violated. One
principles increasing intensity volume sort quickly, it’s past
getting stage you're, just like feeling beat time energy going
down, just not feeling like recovered. Now overreaching stage,
story kind tell always years ago working wife Natasha
garage training something like comes stumbling
look Eyes like eyeballs, giant she's, just like wobbling she's.
Like effed up, like mean like effed she's? Just like, read
program wrong like Trump like what'd. like supposed
10 sets three every minute minute three sets ten every minute
minute absolutely wrecked. couldn't move hours afterwards
days, she's. Just like handle kids like, can't get bed.
can't move like classic example right like don't need fix recovery
here, you're, just dummy, dream way hard long like not
don't problem here. it’s situation like that, it’s generally just program
way off. it’s constantly happening you're, just like man like whatever reason,
every while, getting really sore really bad performance
workouts, need go stress bucket. Take look allostatic load
allostasis get figured happening um.




00:48:19 Overreaching vs. Overtraining

happy pointed distinction functional overreaching, training
trained. think one one common mistake people make thinking
biology generally think terms nouns adjectives not verbs amazing.
love much know, biology collection processes processes depending
live, trained trained state that,
many ways, adjective trained trained. It’s like saying, uh,
know American, know Czechoslovakian whatever happens, right
many ways people start associate identity, least transient identity,
start making sorts decisions. sounds like sorts verbs will
will not engage in, whereas think look things processes assign verbs
them, can say: okay, functionally overreaching truly training,
matter Degrees, correct right training matter, not reaching,
not functionally reaching it’s just it’s just performance, know, just
nervous system, won't change unless give reason reason why,
can Perform something perfectly speak language perfectly. no rewiring
nervous system. myth told every experience rewires
nervous system, it’s different now two seconds ago. That’s that’s ridiculous,
illogical statement. know. That’s not true nervous system can perform something,
no reason change won't muscles way.
progressively overload learn something new challenge muscle
something new, it’s thing. example gave uh wife
workout turned far strenuous, functionally overreach.
sense, might training heading direction training,
mistake assume trained right, kind it’s almost becomes
bit state character assignment um, opposed verb, case,
no perfect way describe - talking nouns adjectives also
um talking verbs. think verbs really anchored processes
things actions can take um. may, like just highlight this,
idea shifting one sinking towards verb actions rather labels state
happen person happen right. Sometimes even become
kind character. Logical way people describe uh, believe
something called training training real words,
don't ever really know trained, nailed it. there's. No, know it’s
not like red flag. Uh, know shoots shoulder say trained.


know it’s um, so, hope can start thinking verbs,
actions can take order ensure stimulate Progressive, overload
one way another time, don't fall bins character
assignment suddenly decide need X like take month off
something like that, beginning realize um discussion that’s
exactly wrong way go. fantastic points want make sure clear
no clinical diagnosis training. no standards, no test
blood panel. can pull. actually identify state.
distinction Here, Andrew verbs, rather nouns is, wonderful
exactly case. way really come retroactively, diagnose
one training is, had. weeks recovery got back
Baseline, can't moment. can't take single test, no subjective
marker anything says trained. simply, probably training,
need reverse quickly case step probably non-
functionally overreaching. continue this, will probably enter new stage
training need come back. that’s important thing
let people know no one thing actually point says

00:52:53 Tool: Acute Overload & Recovery, Breathwork

not noun, verb. tools can use
enhance recovery yep? start off acute overload phase. So, words,
just workout feeling awful just one two days ago super sore.
get rid right now? Well, couple things can immediately
workout others maybe actionable day later two days
later just cover handful them. nutrition hydration
supplementation next episode. going cover everything else, not category
right now, couple things number one. can actually start Kickstart recovery
process end current training session, guess say way.
strongly suggest start recovery process immediately workout
mentioned earlier idea got get really high peak stress cause
adaptation, actually didn't explain correctly, happen
need extremely High peak, met extremely sharp
recovery back down, know talked
neuroplasticity stuff terms happen caused insult.


immediately need able recover make sure causes changes brains
thing happens here. need really sharp high inflammatory response
then, not meet immediate recovery period, signal won't
maximize results. mean can actually couple things? Number
one actually listening slow, paced, music evidence suggest fast-paced music
may slow recovery slow pace actually enhance it. just change
know maximum get get going music workout
slower, lower Cadence will help kick start idea similar note. can also
use call regulation breathing. conjunction one
other, whichever you, personal favorite method somewhere
three ten minutes finishing training session. Laying like
position, certainly Lotus position, think laying back
generally effective personal preference there, no science, like items
covered getting dark quiet sort area Then, just breathing nose
structured, Cadence, lot different things. can try easy example. just
box breathing can imagine box four squares. going
inhale somewhere between, like three eight seconds whatever number
choose, keep tempo, say chose five second inhale,
that’s going take vertically horizontally box five second hold
five second exhale five second hold, just need repeat
time domain. Now typically honestly don't use timer you'll, actually notice. lot
people will like fall asleep get really close falling asleep period. can
triangle version that, inhale, hold exhale go right back
inhale bunch different tricks. can try here, need play around
see actually works best you. Um 10 minutes probably better, can just
least give three that'll work, really really resistant, can actually that. Just
shower, going finish workout get shower again, just close
eyes shower, give three minutes focused relaxation breathing will
accelerate recovery process. love particularly love laboratory
works stress respiration, okay, breathing interactions two
just mention result just accepted publication, time day.
uh. Thank you. Uh beautiful work uh, not directly, although took
place lab, know, it’s students doctors um, Dr Melise uh, balbon
uh lab. It’s phenomenal researcher showed short period five minutes
box breathing exactly type described cyclic sign two inhales, followed
extended exhale lungs empty. Ideally, inhales done nose.


exhales done. Uh mouth, although done nose, um
mouth matter, probably nose. Nose inhale, inhale mouth exhale
um uh inhales, nose exhale nose. Cyclic sighing,
refer done five minutes, produce significant decreases resting
heart rate. time will increase things like heart rate, variability
forth. Um provided extended exhales. seems like calming response,
reduction overall stress occurs. thing really sends things
direction something like cyclic hyperventilation. sure observed um
interestingly uh, people just five minutes meditation which,
which, course, breathing just allowing breathing progress.
However, happens moment, um moments across five minutes uh.
reductions sorts markers stress described not significant
breathing. love Brock's breathing tool, post, workout, um
Alternatives too, just mentioned, think people greatly underestimate
potency breathing shifting one's nervous system function away stress one
wants toward alertness stress. actually couple questions
sure. think audience appreciate uh. long boxes? just
user selected great question, use carbon dioxide tolerance test amazing order
people determine long different sides Box be, cover
carbon dioxide tolerance tests. previous episode, can provide link clip um
show, note captions, but, point out, involves long extended exhale lungs,
empty um and, course, people sit lungs empty, accurately
Faithfully say report long took empty lungs. use
gauge. Typically, takes, people go lungs empty 20 seconds less, believe
go back paper look, believe duration sides
boxes were, somewhere um two three seconds,
CO2 discard time anywhere uh 20 seconds 40 45 seconds, use it.
sides box, believe, four six seconds people
longer discard Arrow period minute more. used
box duration inhale, hold exhale, hold duration somewhere between. believe
[ Music, ], um, seven, maybe eight long 11 12 seconds yeah.
will get kind free diver types. can really this? really well
trained sort thing? don't quote exactly numbers,
approximate. line exactly done. believe it’s it’s going
close within seconds non-important Distinction. it’s going close enough,
that’s great, uh. took six weeks. study done


period month swapped new pattern breathing um,
condition meditation condition - done natural world, say, um
wearing whoop bands. getting heart rate, heart rate, variability, sleep,
data, subjective data mood Etc. lot measures, um
100 subjects wild life um tried best track life, stress
events exercise, things like harder control outside laboratory.
Really results speak exactly exactly describing here,
deliberate respiration involves controlled holds exhales really dramatic
immediate impact reducing levels stress. That’s wonderful! not surprised
findings really interesting that, mentioned
exhalation portion primarily responsible regulation that’s actually goes
back previous endurance conversation, general rest, non-altitude
increases Co2 primary driver ventilation, generally means
inhales associated uptick sympathetic State exhales associated
uptick parasympathetic State. generally, folks will things like exhale
finish exhale right perform high Precision, neurological tasks.
going say, aim Target shoot going Exhale fully almost
always execute movement end exhale, that’s
highest parasympathetic State lowest drive ventilation. say not surprised
guys found actually data point individuals, particularly
endurance. Training can get back Baseline heart rate going
correlated with. gets actual results training. Said take
bunch individuals put endurance training program,
measure quickly can get back Baseline workout general,
folks better going see greater improvements Performance
end say, four six eight week, training block little bit
causation correlation untie. think it’s enough say: hey
invest three case study five minutes. It’s going
enhance recovery, likelihood increasing results training, now
also additional benefits like able transition appropriately next
task, going work going see family whatever thing is, it’s it’s nice close to,
asked high, sympathetic State body, asked perform
stress. gave recovery now ready transition next thing
don't take exercise energy. will next

01:03:39 Tool: Alleviate Acute Soreness, Compression Clothing



task may may not want sympathetic Drive state. somebody sore
following workout, either locally sore muscle, group group muscles, maybe
legs chest torso maybe whole body sore sometimes case.
tools can Implement order accelerate the? want call
moving soreness, it’s really, know, alleviation soreness
bunch different processes. effective tools push back
soreness dissipate yeah? Absolutely. First all, it’s not lactate! That’s just really
important thing still hear people talk about. know sore 24 hours later
got thing get lactate there, talked metabolism,
uh conversation episode not cause fatigue it’s certainly not
cause soreness. not actionable tip there, just pet peeve mine. hear
people say get irritated can maybe end conversation um strategies,
tools, can do, can actually wear compression gear will help little
bit. decent amount evidence, suggesting, just you, know, put
tighter fitting clothes Leisure, wear compression gear. can
actually prevent little bit soreness occurring. case poor
Natasha - realize just done way way much went hung
bow hunting friend trained way hard, realize, oh, goodness,
going sore here. can immediately put compression gear weigh
really long possible. examples compression gear? seen
people plane high high socks um, mean anything wear
compression gear exercise. whether just know,
compression pants leggings tight fitting leggings uh, whether long sleeve
shirt, that’s like rash guard, wear know Jiu, Jitsu surfing, something
like that. long it’s tight fitting, doesn't much can wear.
suppose get socks, great, generally just tell leads them.
put long sleeve compression shirts wear training
long, compression, leggings that'd fine. Can people apply compression
um Garb training still get positive effects yeah? not seen
evidence suggest block adaptation. may case. not aware
studies happens, certainly know information suggests can
hands little bit Muscle Recovery. ideally one knows workout
trigger lot soreness yeah compression gear sort
offset that, local muscle groups working
Reason asked socks understanding. socks uh, compression


socks people plane it’s going shift patterns blood flow, not just
lower legs, body yeah you're, probably going want focus
actual exercising tissue, though, Actually, that’s really good question. don't know
answer whether not upper body workout lower body compression
gear. actually help that’s great question. may done. don't know,
don't know answer general, just tell people like where, whole
thing much can um, actually not concerned wearing
workout. something put afterwards even wear just little bit
compression day. Um actually really fun study. Uh. collaborated
um Bill Kramer who's. Uh, know, Sports scientist Year award. bill Cramer
award, gives indication uh University Connecticut, well Lee
Brown, two Lifetime Achievement Award winners put people plane
stores, Connecticut flew Cal State Fullerton. cross-country flight
got wear compression gear flight others not,
landed California training bout put back plane, went back stores
think another training bout got back there. lot data
came paper, one things clear compression group
effective handling blood related coagulation issues associated
long flights particularly athletic performance. that’s actually sneaky little Insider trick
use lot people, particularly athletes traveling, just wear
compression gear plane. talked sort rung study
mind another effective strategy, compression gear general, well
particularly plane, basically tighter can get better, without obviously
making hands purple uncomfortable things like that, doesn't
overly tight. Anything will work probably help. also personally,
anytime, taking

01:08:27 Tool: Acute Soreness, Massage, Temperature

flight like much can just feel little better get there.
methods can use alleviate acute soreness? Well, continue
theme, saying okay, use sort pressure manipulation
enhance recovery. compression one strategy, can also use things like compression
boots garments, nomadic devices will know, pump uh air outside
compress back forth. number devices will this. can


also use physical hand, massage body work they're, really
working best. can tell mechanisms effectively moving fluid
tissue, well potentially enhancing blood flow, increasing capitalization
going get nutrients waste products out. can kind pick
choose based upon budget preferences availability timing, things like that,
effective strategies outside really next largest category, now
thermal uh, far discussion, mentioned cold water, Immersion
talked hypertrophy section not want immediately: post
exercise, getting cold water ice bath trying grow muscle
mass. said that, good evidence showing cold water immersion
specifically effective reducing muscle soreness. fair consideration it’s
classic example no free passes physiology. Nothing always good
always bad. It’s always willing give versus willing
get case like cold water immersion? may thinking yeah. might want
hypertrophic adaptations, phase training,
actually trying push towards optimization moment, rather long-term
adaptation, ice bath might great choice. addition, fall scenario
like Natasha - realize like just unbelievably sore - might cost three
four five six days training. might worth accelerate recovery
process couple days don't miss much training. it’s just it’s
algorithm, it’s equation. looking season trying compete
just done way way much exercise, really significant pain.
probably willing give small percentage eventual muscle growth
single session get pain cold strategies. Cold water immersion clearly
best approach rather cold air tactics. cold shower probably
not enough here. really want either moderately cold. maybe 40 50
degree, water probably north 15 minutes can sub 40 little maybe
five minutes get fact number studies um.
sort summarizing bunch kind one rather going Point
point. numbers just threw uh, assuming um uh Fahrenheit um,
seem seem really cold right uncomfortably cold. Absolutely always recommend
people ease protocol overall not immediately go 35 degree uh
cold water, never done uh. said, people comfortable
uncomfortable, always answer question: cold exactly?
agree very, cold much really really want get out,
able stay safely? Whatever value happens be, absolutely


need safe. said that, actually, xbt Retreats, put dozens, not
hundreds people point, uh immediately sub 35 degree water first time
ever done. know three minutes multiple rounds session, can handle it.
don't need go crazy. don't want kind play game right,
want really really cold short amount time, want like kind
cold longer amount time? really mistake can make
something like know, 65 degree water people not comfortable
know five ten minutes. It’s just not going be. It’s probably not going
effective. like man 35 is, absolutely crazy want 55 degree, water
literature area. it’s going say need probably
somewhere, almost really north 10 minutes, will actually show need
like well north 20 30 minutes. money rather go really really
cold get done five minutes, um personal preference one. can also
make little bit easier yourself. not nearly much evidence,
contrast. Stuff uh, go cold, hot sort back forth.
no really good rules terms much go, many rounds, long
cold long hot couple studies obviously
studies use numbers, doesn't mean tested See optimal,
big difference, can really just kind play feel hot good
Recovery. just careful going put blood flow
area, may walk additional acute swelling isn't going
put greater pressure there. kind play that. personally really like
hot Recovery. will feel - maybe not great moment, next day tend feel
really really good. addition, wake next morning really really hurting
super stiff, hot bath will help um quite bit, can play
protocols. Again, don't

01:14:21 Cold & Heat Contrast, Cold Shower vs. Immersion, Sauna & Fertility

nice absolutely no requirement so. just option interested
studies Dr Susanna soberg sure yeah not directly aimed alleviating soreness
recovery, increasing thermal capacity storage uh Brown adipose
tissue, not blubbery fat stuff around clavicles around heart help
generate body, heat rest metabolism on, numbers um
come not tested possible derivations just like


breathing. five minute sessions, knows? Maybe minute
equally effective. just constraints sorts studies, values
come with, seem good thresholds making sure
adaptation response triggered heat cold. ends 57 minutes per week,
total uncomfortable safe heat case sauna, can one session
breaking couple sessions day different days, 11
minutes per week. cold either one single session multiple sessions, one
um one break know multiple days one day
one. know hour sauna 11 minutes colder vice versa,
although seems little bit extreme, especially uninitiated.
numbers studied. point out, not lot really thorough
studies examining different cold protocols according temperature time requirements.
bit subjective, feel required establish routine, actually say
another time re-emphasize something. talked beginning
conversation, pain not defined outcome. It’s heavily influenced
perception, so, don't feel like work you, won't work. feel like
work fantastic, so. It’s challenging field get really objective data
always going little bit subjective nature. things, can tell
anecdotally: used hot cold contrast long time athletes. love
don't care everything between. it’s one things never
mandate it. course, can't mandate anything anyone work with, never
know like hey. interested great struggling area? want try this?
liked great struggling area, tried it. didn't love it.
Okay, fine, not find routes, will get lot ways enhance
recovery um. one hasn't even really come stopping problem
first place, not just treating symptoms, first line defense,
really need go back figure it’s happening begin with, Solution,
just different acute symptom management tactics. One final point uh,
deliberate, cold exposure. think worth mentioning one reasons shower
effective, not nearly effective cold water, immersion immersion ice
neck simply reason stated before, showers not
going get cold not going get know sub 40s. Also cold
showers haven't really studied much have, not nearly much
immersion people always ask just think challenges studying cold water
exposure shower, can't really control mango? much body
covered, whether not head stays different size bodies, Etc? Whereas


people come laboratory, can get cold large, know neck
is. know chin can make sure people's arms um legs
underneath, cold shower sure can make everyone face away toward
shower, it’s really tricky um variations described. said,
agree one wants use deliberate cold exposure, cold shower better
nothing cold immersion circulating, cold water ice bath better um
cold shower yeah? actually say looking recovery muscle soreness,
say cold shower, probably little, not going able
get enough cold water onto muscle, besides, basically head, maybe
try cold bath least get surface area coverage, yeah want
use cold shower awesome reasons cold shower. That’s totally great.
trying use recover low back glutes sore training
good way, it’s probably not going much immersion there.
actually also hit sneaky point, is, can't get water super cold, just
make water move. Jets stuff can turn anyone tried
like. Okay, can 40 degree. Bath awesome, try 60, water
moving right, break thermal layer. Normally little thin layer
water heating up. break up. It’s whole new world, yeah, absolutely
still cold. Water actually weaker way go correct can make
face stoic, make body circulate water around long
this. Maybe just one point heat uh: certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry,
sauna, steam saunas. Excuse me, jacuzzis can work pretty well yep um uh males.
looking conceive 60 days following uh uh following sauna um, hot tub realize
approaches severely limit number motile sperm um
substantially. people not trying conceive uh. Don'T think works
reliably enough, use form contraception yeah, people
trying conceive. really detrimental sperm Health right reason
people bring ice pack put groin near groin go
um, hard hot tub sauna. getting fine points,
um crude points, will pun intended, um, idea wouldn't want
anyone approach techniques compromise life goals, certainly not
allowed anywhere near things. uh, stage Life, just say
Natasha put x hanging Laird. reasons, like you're, not
going you're, not going none stuff, just wait right heat um heat


sperm relationship it’s not one that’s positive sperm


01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques

ways combine various types stimuli described inducing
recovery? talked breathing based tools which, adjust indeed
adjust oxygen carbon dioxide ratios Etc. guessing major effect
recovery going neural. It’s going deliberate, calm nervous system,
sympathetic, based uh, mentioned, yeah definitely, talked
movement based touch-based approaches. Um, will uh movement
circulate, certainly will circulate blood, also will generate contractions muscles yep
right, maybe, if, indeed again, still speculates you, indeed soreness
due excessive stretch swelling stretch, ends muscles
make sense movement touch thermal, ways combine
um effective maybe even synergistic yeah. suppose throw uh
compression garments put Pneumatic compression device sit sauna.
regulate breath like fine. Quite honestly, though,
probably don't need maximize them. joking. probably go
light swim regulating breathing cold water. get compression
cold, water good spot, certainly that. reality
is. generally look physical approach holistic approach breath
work. Basically, want breath something else knock two things
good spot, breath thermal stress, just
controlling unregulation stuff. also remember ice stressor
actually show data second actually can enhance
systemic recovery, although won't happen acute minutes. fact, it’s going
take least 30 60 minutes eventually see rebound effect, acutely it’s
going make actually sympathetic, going direction. can
opposite can actually drive up. it’s little bit dependent upon
respond, time day you're, using general, guess combining
need um, depending available. perhaps don't
sauna, can take hot bath great. Maybe percussion device
tool can use that. don't sauna amazing. don't ice bath


things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

sleep, deprivation can identified blood Chemistry optimization improvements
nutrition, supplementation lot can get there. people interested field,
Point gentleman named Dan Garner. just absolute Juggernaut
wizard blood chemistry high performance, well can get ton information
that. understand difference exactly talked about. Looking
signals increased risk cardiovascular events, 25 years road versus, this:
optimal value high performance athlete, database
software stuff does, looking things. going talk
biomarkers look little

00:30:20 Recovery Timescales, Adaptation & Optimization

Bit later salivary blood stuff, maybe save part conversation
road. Tell different time scales recovery. Sure actually
trying answer question got way off track, reason
brought Hermetic thing is: understand things acute say, 24
40 hour period, look terrible. It’s actually fine right, stimuli, that’s causing
adaptation. reason brought medical exchange you,
looked inflammatory markers mentioned them, see
highest acute within seconds minutes hours exercise. However, that’s
exactly stimuli needed bring chronically, okay chronically meaning.
Maybe moment elevated maybe coming 24 hours later
48 hours. However, compare resting level say Monday,
worked resting level, Monday week following week following that,
probably see Baseline inflammation goes down, got
really careful. talking immediately post-exercise man, markers look terrible?
Maybe recovery score awful, Etc. That’s not necessarily bad thing,
like looking not change happening today, trying
cause adaptation may take us weeks months actually access. love
highlighting principle, one obvious ones now said
heart rate. Absolutely. heart rate goes very, high exercise,
fairly consistently even semi-consistently. resting heart rate will actually quite bit
lower. That’s fantastic example! Really getting concept,
think it’s important differentiate adaptation optimization. Now hear
word use scientists hate it, it’s good communication tool, optimization


optimizing current moment, almost surely compromising late
adaptation right. If, say, thing right now makes feel absolute
best world like great, took nap donut like awesome,
feel amazing, know it’s causing long-term issues. can said
back end, never choosing things make better right now, never
actually going see adaptation. really recovery
conversation playing game balancing immediate gratification leg
gratification, identify much now versus not? use value
marker? Whether tired feel today, sore today versus score
app tracking metric, blood marker, anything understand. that’s
need cause adaptation, want week month, three months now
case athletes, it’s even four years right, trying cause
adaptations will get us want get Olympics World Championships
World Cup, wherever going that’s framework, think
recovery. maybe falsely think need maximize recovery today
something like taken anti-inflammatory, whether supplementation
drug, maybe ice. Oh cool, that’s great! will enhance recovery
moment. That'Ll make feel better today, probably tomorrow, know
blocks signal adaptation, not going get results. know four
six, eight weeks now. talk recovery, understand tool
am. using order that, understand training
trying maximize middle season athlete
competing tomorrow, going head towards Acute recovery right
actuate performance right now, starting off season, not hedging towards
recovery, actually hedging towards adaptation, not going deploy these,
especially things like evidence combination vitamin C vitamin E will
blunt hypertrophic adaptations anti-inflammatory antioxidants right
Studies shown? Maybe don't uh inhibitory fact may may not
point conceptually. want careful trying optimize for,
forethought alone going dictate decision making
whether not get eyes uh now will cover tools, Like
massage pretty fine use, don't worry blocking

00:35:10 Adaptation & Biomarkers Levels



Long-Term adaptation, others going want careful
principle laid us, set events occur
exercise trigger adaptation sets motion number adaptations
occur recovery give us exact opposite response trigger
go back heart rate example: um heart rate close maximal maximal.
enough times within short know week two weeks resting
heart rate goes down. recall episodes ago, said maximum heart rate
doesn't really change. much. correct? Yes, okay, resting heart rate can
go quite bit yep. general theme meaning less set
upper limit ceiling things like inflammatory markers heart rate, maybe even things
like stress deliberately trigger stress dramatic increase
heart rate dramatic Increase inflammatory markers lowering floor,
ceiling Remains Same. It’s dependent upon marker, case
maximum heart rate, will not change exception one thing age, brings
down. Training will not change circumstances. look something like
inflammatory response, suppose, theoretically, ceiling, though not aware
um. can tell right now, looking blood markers, things like creatine kinase,
remember conversation metabolism use phosphocreatine
one primary fuel sources explosive exercise. Well, using phosphocreatine
creatine kinase, remember, kinase enzymes function break things
part, creatine kinase enzyme use break creatine
that. lot, creatine kinase gets muscle seeps blood
myoglobin actually another fantastic marker. way, myoglobin is, think
hemoglobin blood, molecule carries oxygen around it’s
muscle tissue. it’s myoglobin mild, meaning muscle it’s globulin thing.
bunch markers can look muscle breakdown one things
can see creatine kinase level. That’s elevated say, um, one bout exercise and,
might, might up. know five six-fold. actually seen number
offensive lineman NFL, something like 500 plus fold, even within just one
category next. number can get extraordinarily high know actually
one important Point here, paying attention mechanistic research
use you're, using inform decision making, extraordinarily careful
magnitude Mean is, running western blot looking
signaling protein um muscle uh activation protein turn mitochondrial
biogenesis, saw whatever intervention gave it, whether nutrition thing
drug exercise - saw signaling protein increased 20 percent.


basically assume totally physiologically irrelevant, order
important, totally depends market looking at, markers
might need see four five six hundred fold increase before. know will actually
enough call physiologically relevant others one two percent
relevant, really want careful either reading papers
looking Social Media stuff. people just talking this, marker increase much,
may not matter, may totally irrelevant physiologically,
also, wondering like hell are, people. Well, that’s can
trick little bit intentionally not. just trying best,
don't really understand area enough, that’s important point pay attention to.
So. answer question fully, hard determine truly
maximum level um. things don't want move like blood pH. doesn't really want
move range going move from, know like 6.8 7.4, get
like 7.9, like you're, probably big big big trouble, things can go 500 5 000
fold, markers will really determine answer well point future.
love continue discussion around topic stress, specifically yeah um,
maybe will get little bit later today um get use deliberate
cold exposure, that’s certainly um effects related directly temperature
tissue. certainly mental effects terms raising one's level perceived pain. It’s
fun um, people love people love feeling get it.
Um deliberate cold exposure. people like feeling get not
unlike exercise totally. love train. love exercise, know many people uh um.
loathe exercise, love feeling afterward. will theme will
come back to. Thank indulging interest

00:40:36 4 Recovery Levels, Enhance Recovery

semi-tangent, think it’s relevant tangent thing, can now return
us different time, scales, yeah modes recovery, think
headed get better recovery. Yep. talk tools, talk
measure identify four distinct levels, level one call
overload just quickly means is. workout today. sign
symptom overload fatigued. Acute performance down, worked hard right
now. go, try maximum effort, reduced ability.
recovery period acute overload minutes days right. That’s generally, call


acute overload that’s looking right. systems theoretically
see hormetic stressor come back response, come back, bigger, better, efficient,
Etc. continue training state, like us, say workout
today, little bit acute overload going work tomorrow. little acute
overload can work next day little acute overload. Even took day
it’s doesn't matter right, just continue acute bouts insult
going pushing absolute golden Target, call functional
overreaching. reached can currently results
functional outcome, mean functionally performance enhanced
performance whatever deem stronger, you've, enhanced
muscle size, mitochondria improved you've, whatever thing is, it’s not just
physical performance thing right, amazing, recovery time functional overreaching
typically days maybe even week so, typically, see happen
prior competition. Individuals will call taper, reduced training
volume short period time, reason do. again.
Actualize phrase year adaptations, worked hard six
weeks know, theoretically, workouts. three four five six weeks ago,
allow, system recover will actualized, means performance will
enhanced. functional overreaching golden Target. Okay,
point functional overreaching - continue train intensified whether
intensity volume really. said earlier, something
holding back recovery. doesn't really matter right. It’s it’s sort two sides
coin. move call non-functional overreaching
reached again, now non-functional not see positive benefit
recovery allowed. typically means weeks takes weeks come back from,
basically just get back Baseline, lot folks end
vicious cycle, like man, not getting results. want. going train
harder, not getting results. want going train harder harder,
caught recovery isn't improved, just end spot. train
end spot end up. just either blowing quitting
not getting want. continue past point, may
actually actually call training typically, considered
trained takes months recover people think trained really
not you're. Just probably non-functionally overreached classic distinction is,
took three four days off felt better, weren't, probably quote unquote
trained. probably just area non-functional reaching. need little bit


back off - case. happen gymnasts
cheerleader things take month off barely seeing
start come back Baseline numbers. number areas, mood desire
train testosterone, cortisol ratios biomarkers number areas - physical performance,
vertical jump height, like things just start get back Baseline, true
training actually quite rare. Non-Functional overreaching much common
shorter time frame scale. talk recovery, four pieces
really thinking about, so, concerned about, oh super sore.
get less sore? either not sore next time? workout
super sorry. Now. recover playing first category overload
can certainly talk figure out. quick answer got go back
previous episodes just pay attention volume intensity recommendations
getting significantly uh damage fatigue workout? probably
increased volume quickly, something else dragging stress bucket down,
generally, problem training. Um either didn't warm sufficiently.
fueling strategy off talk Next Episode violated. One
principles increasing intensity volume sort quickly, it’s past
getting stage you're, just like feeling beat time energy going
down, just not feeling like recovered. Now overreaching stage,
story kind tell always years ago working wife Natasha
garage training something like comes stumbling
look Eyes like eyeballs, giant she's, just like wobbling she's.
Like effed up, like mean like effed she's? Just like, read
program wrong like Trump like what'd. like supposed
10 sets three every minute minute three sets ten every minute
minute absolutely wrecked. couldn't move hours afterwards
days, she's. Just like handle kids like, can't get bed.
can't move like classic example right like don't need fix recovery
here, you're, just dummy, dream way hard long like not
don't problem here. it’s situation like that, it’s generally just program
way off. it’s constantly happening you're, just like man like whatever reason,
every while, getting really sore really bad performance
workouts, need go stress bucket. Take look allostatic load
allostasis get figured happening um.




00:48:19 Overreaching vs. Overtraining

happy pointed distinction functional overreaching, training
trained. think one one common mistake people make thinking
biology generally think terms nouns adjectives not verbs amazing.
love much know, biology collection processes processes depending
live, trained trained state that,
many ways, adjective trained trained. It’s like saying, uh,
know American, know Czechoslovakian whatever happens, right
many ways people start associate identity, least transient identity,
start making sorts decisions. sounds like sorts verbs will
will not engage in, whereas think look things processes assign verbs
them, can say: okay, functionally overreaching truly training,
matter Degrees, correct right training matter, not reaching,
not functionally reaching it’s just it’s just performance, know, just
nervous system, won't change unless give reason reason why,
can Perform something perfectly speak language perfectly. no rewiring
nervous system. myth told every experience rewires
nervous system, it’s different now two seconds ago. That’s that’s ridiculous,
illogical statement. know. That’s not true nervous system can perform something,
no reason change won't muscles way.
progressively overload learn something new challenge muscle
something new, it’s thing. example gave uh wife
workout turned far strenuous, functionally overreach.
sense, might training heading direction training,
mistake assume trained right, kind it’s almost becomes
bit state character assignment um, opposed verb, case,
no perfect way describe - talking nouns adjectives also
um talking verbs. think verbs really anchored processes
things actions can take um. may, like just highlight this,
idea shifting one sinking towards verb actions rather labels state
happen person happen right. Sometimes even become
kind character. Logical way people describe uh, believe
something called training training real words,
don't ever really know trained, nailed it. there's. No, know it’s
not like red flag. Uh, know shoots shoulder say trained.


know it’s um, so, hope can start thinking verbs,
actions can take order ensure stimulate Progressive, overload
one way another time, don't fall bins character
assignment suddenly decide need X like take month off
something like that, beginning realize um discussion that’s
exactly wrong way go. fantastic points want make sure clear
no clinical diagnosis training. no standards, no test
blood panel. can pull. actually identify state.
distinction Here, Andrew verbs, rather nouns is, wonderful
exactly case. way really come retroactively, diagnose
one training is, had. weeks recovery got back
Baseline, can't moment. can't take single test, no subjective
marker anything says trained. simply, probably training,
need reverse quickly case step probably non-
functionally overreaching. continue this, will probably enter new stage
training need come back. that’s important thing
let people know no one thing actually point says

00:52:53 Tool: Acute Overload & Recovery, Breathwork

not noun, verb. tools can use
enhance recovery yep? start off acute overload phase. So, words,
just workout feeling awful just one two days ago super sore.
get rid right now? Well, couple things can immediately
workout others maybe actionable day later two days
later just cover handful them. nutrition hydration
supplementation next episode. going cover everything else, not category
right now, couple things number one. can actually start Kickstart recovery
process end current training session, guess say way.
strongly suggest start recovery process immediately workout
mentioned earlier idea got get really high peak stress cause
adaptation, actually didn't explain correctly, happen
need extremely High peak, met extremely sharp
recovery back down, know talked
neuroplasticity stuff terms happen caused insult.


immediately need able recover make sure causes changes brains
thing happens here. need really sharp high inflammatory response
then, not meet immediate recovery period, signal won't
maximize results. mean can actually couple things? Number
one actually listening slow, paced, music evidence suggest fast-paced music
may slow recovery slow pace actually enhance it. just change
know maximum get get going music workout
slower, lower Cadence will help kick start idea similar note. can also
use call regulation breathing. conjunction one
other, whichever you, personal favorite method somewhere
three ten minutes finishing training session. Laying like
position, certainly Lotus position, think laying back
generally effective personal preference there, no science, like items
covered getting dark quiet sort area Then, just breathing nose
structured, Cadence, lot different things. can try easy example. just
box breathing can imagine box four squares. going
inhale somewhere between, like three eight seconds whatever number
choose, keep tempo, say chose five second inhale,
that’s going take vertically horizontally box five second hold
five second exhale five second hold, just need repeat
time domain. Now typically honestly don't use timer you'll, actually notice. lot
people will like fall asleep get really close falling asleep period. can
triangle version that, inhale, hold exhale go right back
inhale bunch different tricks. can try here, need play around
see actually works best you. Um 10 minutes probably better, can just
least give three that'll work, really really resistant, can actually that. Just
shower, going finish workout get shower again, just close
eyes shower, give three minutes focused relaxation breathing will
accelerate recovery process. love particularly love laboratory
works stress respiration, okay, breathing interactions two
just mention result just accepted publication, time day.
uh. Thank you. Uh beautiful work uh, not directly, although took
place lab, know, it’s students doctors um, Dr Melise uh, balbon
uh lab. It’s phenomenal researcher showed short period five minutes
box breathing exactly type described cyclic sign two inhales, followed
extended exhale lungs empty. Ideally, inhales done nose.


exhales done. Uh mouth, although done nose, um
mouth matter, probably nose. Nose inhale, inhale mouth exhale
um uh inhales, nose exhale nose. Cyclic sighing,
refer done five minutes, produce significant decreases resting
heart rate. time will increase things like heart rate, variability
forth. Um provided extended exhales. seems like calming response,
reduction overall stress occurs. thing really sends things
direction something like cyclic hyperventilation. sure observed um
interestingly uh, people just five minutes meditation which,
which, course, breathing just allowing breathing progress.
However, happens moment, um moments across five minutes uh.
reductions sorts markers stress described not significant
breathing. love Brock's breathing tool, post, workout, um
Alternatives too, just mentioned, think people greatly underestimate
potency breathing shifting one's nervous system function away stress one
wants toward alertness stress. actually couple questions
sure. think audience appreciate uh. long boxes? just
user selected great question, use carbon dioxide tolerance test amazing order
people determine long different sides Box be, cover
carbon dioxide tolerance tests. previous episode, can provide link clip um
show, note captions, but, point out, involves long extended exhale lungs,
empty um and, course, people sit lungs empty, accurately
Faithfully say report long took empty lungs. use
gauge. Typically, takes, people go lungs empty 20 seconds less, believe
go back paper look, believe duration sides
boxes were, somewhere um two three seconds,
CO2 discard time anywhere uh 20 seconds 40 45 seconds, use it.
sides box, believe, four six seconds people
longer discard Arrow period minute more. used
box duration inhale, hold exhale, hold duration somewhere between. believe
[ Music, ], um, seven, maybe eight long 11 12 seconds yeah.
will get kind free diver types. can really this? really well
trained sort thing? don't quote exactly numbers,
approximate. line exactly done. believe it’s it’s going
close within seconds non-important Distinction. it’s going close enough,
that’s great, uh. took six weeks. study done


period month swapped new pattern breathing um,
condition meditation condition - done natural world, say, um
wearing whoop bands. getting heart rate, heart rate, variability, sleep,
data, subjective data mood Etc. lot measures, um
100 subjects wild life um tried best track life, stress
events exercise, things like harder control outside laboratory.
Really results speak exactly exactly describing here,
deliberate respiration involves controlled holds exhales really dramatic
immediate impact reducing levels stress. That’s wonderful! not surprised
findings really interesting that, mentioned
exhalation portion primarily responsible regulation that’s actually goes
back previous endurance conversation, general rest, non-altitude
increases Co2 primary driver ventilation, generally means
inhales associated uptick sympathetic State exhales associated
uptick parasympathetic State. generally, folks will things like exhale
finish exhale right perform high Precision, neurological tasks.
going say, aim Target shoot going Exhale fully almost
always execute movement end exhale, that’s
highest parasympathetic State lowest drive ventilation. say not surprised
guys found actually data point individuals, particularly
endurance. Training can get back Baseline heart rate going
correlated with. gets actual results training. Said take
bunch individuals put endurance training program,
measure quickly can get back Baseline workout general,
folks better going see greater improvements Performance
end say, four six eight week, training block little bit
causation correlation untie. think it’s enough say: hey
invest three case study five minutes. It’s going
enhance recovery, likelihood increasing results training, now
also additional benefits like able transition appropriately next
task, going work going see family whatever thing is, it’s it’s nice close to,
asked high, sympathetic State body, asked perform
stress. gave recovery now ready transition next thing
don't take exercise energy. will next

01:03:39 Tool: Alleviate Acute Soreness, Compression Clothing



task may may not want sympathetic Drive state. somebody sore
following workout, either locally sore muscle, group group muscles, maybe
legs chest torso maybe whole body sore sometimes case.
tools can Implement order accelerate the? want call
moving soreness, it’s really, know, alleviation soreness
bunch different processes. effective tools push back
soreness dissipate yeah? Absolutely. First all, it’s not lactate! That’s just really
important thing still hear people talk about. know sore 24 hours later
got thing get lactate there, talked metabolism,
uh conversation episode not cause fatigue it’s certainly not
cause soreness. not actionable tip there, just pet peeve mine. hear
people say get irritated can maybe end conversation um strategies,
tools, can do, can actually wear compression gear will help little
bit. decent amount evidence, suggesting, just you, know, put
tighter fitting clothes Leisure, wear compression gear. can
actually prevent little bit soreness occurring. case poor
Natasha - realize just done way way much went hung
bow hunting friend trained way hard, realize, oh, goodness,
going sore here. can immediately put compression gear weigh
really long possible. examples compression gear? seen
people plane high high socks um, mean anything wear
compression gear exercise. whether just know,
compression pants leggings tight fitting leggings uh, whether long sleeve
shirt, that’s like rash guard, wear know Jiu, Jitsu surfing, something
like that. long it’s tight fitting, doesn't much can wear.
suppose get socks, great, generally just tell leads them.
put long sleeve compression shirts wear training
long, compression, leggings that'd fine. Can people apply compression
um Garb training still get positive effects yeah? not seen
evidence suggest block adaptation. may case. not aware
studies happens, certainly know information suggests can
hands little bit Muscle Recovery. ideally one knows workout
trigger lot soreness yeah compression gear sort
offset that, local muscle groups working
Reason asked socks understanding. socks uh, compression


socks people plane it’s going shift patterns blood flow, not just
lower legs, body yeah you're, probably going want focus
actual exercising tissue, though, Actually, that’s really good question. don't know
answer whether not upper body workout lower body compression
gear. actually help that’s great question. may done. don't know,
don't know answer general, just tell people like where, whole
thing much can um, actually not concerned wearing
workout. something put afterwards even wear just little bit
compression day. Um actually really fun study. Uh. collaborated
um Bill Kramer who's. Uh, know, Sports scientist Year award. bill Cramer
award, gives indication uh University Connecticut, well Lee
Brown, two Lifetime Achievement Award winners put people plane
stores, Connecticut flew Cal State Fullerton. cross-country flight
got wear compression gear flight others not,
landed California training bout put back plane, went back stores
think another training bout got back there. lot data
came paper, one things clear compression group
effective handling blood related coagulation issues associated
long flights particularly athletic performance. that’s actually sneaky little Insider trick
use lot people, particularly athletes traveling, just wear
compression gear plane. talked sort rung study
mind another effective strategy, compression gear general, well
particularly plane, basically tighter can get better, without obviously
making hands purple uncomfortable things like that, doesn't
overly tight. Anything will work probably help. also personally,
anytime, taking

01:08:27 Tool: Acute Soreness, Massage, Temperature

flight like much can just feel little better get there.
methods can use alleviate acute soreness? Well, continue
theme, saying okay, use sort pressure manipulation
enhance recovery. compression one strategy, can also use things like compression
boots garments, nomadic devices will know, pump uh air outside
compress back forth. number devices will this. can


also use physical hand, massage body work they're, really
working best. can tell mechanisms effectively moving fluid
tissue, well potentially enhancing blood flow, increasing capitalization
going get nutrients waste products out. can kind pick
choose based upon budget preferences availability timing, things like that,
effective strategies outside really next largest category, now
thermal uh, far discussion, mentioned cold water, Immersion
talked hypertrophy section not want immediately: post
exercise, getting cold water ice bath trying grow muscle
mass. said that, good evidence showing cold water immersion
specifically effective reducing muscle soreness. fair consideration it’s
classic example no free passes physiology. Nothing always good
always bad. It’s always willing give versus willing
get case like cold water immersion? may thinking yeah. might want
hypertrophic adaptations, phase training,
actually trying push towards optimization moment, rather long-term
adaptation, ice bath might great choice. addition, fall scenario
like Natasha - realize like just unbelievably sore - might cost three
four five six days training. might worth accelerate recovery
process couple days don't miss much training. it’s just it’s
algorithm, it’s equation. looking season trying compete
just done way way much exercise, really significant pain.
probably willing give small percentage eventual muscle growth
single session get pain cold strategies. Cold water immersion clearly
best approach rather cold air tactics. cold shower probably
not enough here. really want either moderately cold. maybe 40 50
degree, water probably north 15 minutes can sub 40 little maybe
five minutes get fact number studies um.
sort summarizing bunch kind one rather going Point
point. numbers just threw uh, assuming um uh Fahrenheit um,
seem seem really cold right uncomfortably cold. Absolutely always recommend
people ease protocol overall not immediately go 35 degree uh
cold water, never done uh. said, people comfortable
uncomfortable, always answer question: cold exactly?
agree very, cold much really really want get out,
able stay safely? Whatever value happens be, absolutely


need safe. said that, actually, xbt Retreats, put dozens, not
hundreds people point, uh immediately sub 35 degree water first time
ever done. know three minutes multiple rounds session, can handle it.
don't need go crazy. don't want kind play game right,
want really really cold short amount time, want like kind
cold longer amount time? really mistake can make
something like know, 65 degree water people not comfortable
know five ten minutes. It’s just not going be. It’s probably not going
effective. like man 35 is, absolutely crazy want 55 degree, water
literature area. it’s going say need probably
somewhere, almost really north 10 minutes, will actually show need
like well north 20 30 minutes. money rather go really really
cold get done five minutes, um personal preference one. can also
make little bit easier yourself. not nearly much evidence,
contrast. Stuff uh, go cold, hot sort back forth.
no really good rules terms much go, many rounds, long
cold long hot couple studies obviously
studies use numbers, doesn't mean tested See optimal,
big difference, can really just kind play feel hot good
Recovery. just careful going put blood flow
area, may walk additional acute swelling isn't going
put greater pressure there. kind play that. personally really like
hot Recovery. will feel - maybe not great moment, next day tend feel
really really good. addition, wake next morning really really hurting
super stiff, hot bath will help um quite bit, can play
protocols. Again, don't

01:14:21 Cold & Heat Contrast, Cold Shower vs. Immersion, Sauna & Fertility

nice absolutely no requirement so. just option interested
studies Dr Susanna soberg sure yeah not directly aimed alleviating soreness
recovery, increasing thermal capacity storage uh Brown adipose
tissue, not blubbery fat stuff around clavicles around heart help
generate body, heat rest metabolism on, numbers um
come not tested possible derivations just like


breathing. five minute sessions, knows? Maybe minute
equally effective. just constraints sorts studies, values
come with, seem good thresholds making sure
adaptation response triggered heat cold. ends 57 minutes per week,
total uncomfortable safe heat case sauna, can one session
breaking couple sessions day different days, 11
minutes per week. cold either one single session multiple sessions, one
um one break know multiple days one day
one. know hour sauna 11 minutes colder vice versa,
although seems little bit extreme, especially uninitiated.
numbers studied. point out, not lot really thorough
studies examining different cold protocols according temperature time requirements.
bit subjective, feel required establish routine, actually say
another time re-emphasize something. talked beginning
conversation, pain not defined outcome. It’s heavily influenced
perception, so, don't feel like work you, won't work. feel like
work fantastic, so. It’s challenging field get really objective data
always going little bit subjective nature. things, can tell
anecdotally: used hot cold contrast long time athletes. love
don't care everything between. it’s one things never
mandate it. course, can't mandate anything anyone work with, never
know like hey. interested great struggling area? want try this?
liked great struggling area, tried it. didn't love it.
Okay, fine, not find routes, will get lot ways enhance
recovery um. one hasn't even really come stopping problem
first place, not just treating symptoms, first line defense,
really need go back figure it’s happening begin with, Solution,
just different acute symptom management tactics. One final point uh,
deliberate, cold exposure. think worth mentioning one reasons shower
effective, not nearly effective cold water, immersion immersion ice
neck simply reason stated before, showers not
going get cold not going get know sub 40s. Also cold
showers haven't really studied much have, not nearly much
immersion people always ask just think challenges studying cold water
exposure shower, can't really control mango? much body
covered, whether not head stays different size bodies, Etc? Whereas


people come laboratory, can get cold large, know neck
is. know chin can make sure people's arms um legs
underneath, cold shower sure can make everyone face away toward
shower, it’s really tricky um variations described. said,
agree one wants use deliberate cold exposure, cold shower better
nothing cold immersion circulating, cold water ice bath better um
cold shower yeah? actually say looking recovery muscle soreness,
say cold shower, probably little, not going able
get enough cold water onto muscle, besides, basically head, maybe
try cold bath least get surface area coverage, yeah want
use cold shower awesome reasons cold shower. That’s totally great.
trying use recover low back glutes sore training
good way, it’s probably not going much immersion there.
actually also hit sneaky point, is, can't get water super cold, just
make water move. Jets stuff can turn anyone tried
like. Okay, can 40 degree. Bath awesome, try 60, water
moving right, break thermal layer. Normally little thin layer
water heating up. break up. It’s whole new world, yeah, absolutely
still cold. Water actually weaker way go correct can make
face stoic, make body circulate water around long
this. Maybe just one point heat uh: certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry,
sauna, steam saunas. Excuse me, jacuzzis can work pretty well yep um uh males.
looking conceive 60 days following uh uh following sauna um, hot tub realize
approaches severely limit number motile sperm um
substantially. people not trying conceive uh. Don'T think works
reliably enough, use form contraception yeah, people
trying conceive. really detrimental sperm Health right reason
people bring ice pack put groin near groin go
um, hard hot tub sauna. getting fine points,
um crude points, will pun intended, um, idea wouldn't want
anyone approach techniques compromise life goals, certainly not
allowed anywhere near things. uh, stage Life, just say
Natasha put x hanging Laird. reasons, like you're, not
going you're, not going none stuff, just wait right heat um heat


sperm relationship it’s not one that’s positive sperm


01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques

ways combine various types stimuli described inducing
recovery? talked breathing based tools which, adjust indeed
adjust oxygen carbon dioxide ratios Etc. guessing major effect
recovery going neural. It’s going deliberate, calm nervous system,
sympathetic, based uh, mentioned, yeah definitely, talked
movement based touch-based approaches. Um, will uh movement
circulate, certainly will circulate blood, also will generate contractions muscles yep
right, maybe, if, indeed again, still speculates you, indeed soreness
due excessive stretch swelling stretch, ends muscles
make sense movement touch thermal, ways combine
um effective maybe even synergistic yeah. suppose throw uh
compression garments put Pneumatic compression device sit sauna.
regulate breath like fine. Quite honestly, though,
probably don't need maximize them. joking. probably go
light swim regulating breathing cold water. get compression
cold, water good spot, certainly that. reality
is. generally look physical approach holistic approach breath
work. Basically, want breath something else knock two things
good spot, breath thermal stress, just
controlling unregulation stuff. also remember ice stressor
actually show data second actually can enhance
systemic recovery, although won't happen acute minutes. fact, it’s going
take least 30 60 minutes eventually see rebound effect, acutely it’s
going make actually sympathetic, going direction. can
opposite can actually drive up. it’s little bit dependent upon
respond, time day you're, using general, guess combining
need um, depending available. perhaps don't
sauna, can take hot bath great. Maybe percussion device
tool can use that. don't sauna amazing. don't ice bath


things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

optimizing current moment, almost surely compromising late
adaptation right. If, say, thing right now makes feel absolute
best world like great, took nap donut like awesome,
feel amazing, know it’s causing long-term issues. can said
back end, never choosing things make better right now, never
actually going see adaptation. really recovery
conversation playing game balancing immediate gratification leg
gratification, identify much now versus not? use value
marker? Whether tired feel today, sore today versus score
app tracking metric, blood marker, anything understand. that’s
need cause adaptation, want week month, three months now
case athletes, it’s even four years right, trying cause
adaptations will get us want get Olympics World Championships
World Cup, wherever going that’s framework, think
recovery. maybe falsely think need maximize recovery today
something like taken anti-inflammatory, whether supplementation
drug, maybe ice. Oh cool, that’s great! will enhance recovery
moment. That'Ll make feel better today, probably tomorrow, know
blocks signal adaptation, not going get results. know four
six, eight weeks now. talk recovery, understand tool
am. using order that, understand training
trying maximize middle season athlete
competing tomorrow, going head towards Acute recovery right
actuate performance right now, starting off season, not hedging towards
recovery, actually hedging towards adaptation, not going deploy these,
especially things like evidence combination vitamin C vitamin E will
blunt hypertrophic adaptations anti-inflammatory antioxidants right
Studies shown? Maybe don't uh inhibitory fact may may not
point conceptually. want careful trying optimize for,
forethought alone going dictate decision making
whether not get eyes uh now will cover tools, Like
massage pretty fine use, don't worry blocking

00:35:10 Adaptation & Biomarkers Levels



Long-Term adaptation, others going want careful
principle laid us, set events occur
exercise trigger adaptation sets motion number adaptations
occur recovery give us exact opposite response trigger
go back heart rate example: um heart rate close maximal maximal.
enough times within short know week two weeks resting
heart rate goes down. recall episodes ago, said maximum heart rate
doesn't really change. much. correct? Yes, okay, resting heart rate can
go quite bit yep. general theme meaning less set
upper limit ceiling things like inflammatory markers heart rate, maybe even things
like stress deliberately trigger stress dramatic increase
heart rate dramatic Increase inflammatory markers lowering floor,
ceiling Remains Same. It’s dependent upon marker, case
maximum heart rate, will not change exception one thing age, brings
down. Training will not change circumstances. look something like
inflammatory response, suppose, theoretically, ceiling, though not aware
um. can tell right now, looking blood markers, things like creatine kinase,
remember conversation metabolism use phosphocreatine
one primary fuel sources explosive exercise. Well, using phosphocreatine
creatine kinase, remember, kinase enzymes function break things
part, creatine kinase enzyme use break creatine
that. lot, creatine kinase gets muscle seeps blood
myoglobin actually another fantastic marker. way, myoglobin is, think
hemoglobin blood, molecule carries oxygen around it’s
muscle tissue. it’s myoglobin mild, meaning muscle it’s globulin thing.
bunch markers can look muscle breakdown one things
can see creatine kinase level. That’s elevated say, um, one bout exercise and,
might, might up. know five six-fold. actually seen number
offensive lineman NFL, something like 500 plus fold, even within just one
category next. number can get extraordinarily high know actually
one important Point here, paying attention mechanistic research
use you're, using inform decision making, extraordinarily careful
magnitude Mean is, running western blot looking
signaling protein um muscle uh activation protein turn mitochondrial
biogenesis, saw whatever intervention gave it, whether nutrition thing
drug exercise - saw signaling protein increased 20 percent.


basically assume totally physiologically irrelevant, order
important, totally depends market looking at, markers
might need see four five six hundred fold increase before. know will actually
enough call physiologically relevant others one two percent
relevant, really want careful either reading papers
looking Social Media stuff. people just talking this, marker increase much,
may not matter, may totally irrelevant physiologically,
also, wondering like hell are, people. Well, that’s can
trick little bit intentionally not. just trying best,
don't really understand area enough, that’s important point pay attention to.
So. answer question fully, hard determine truly
maximum level um. things don't want move like blood pH. doesn't really want
move range going move from, know like 6.8 7.4, get
like 7.9, like you're, probably big big big trouble, things can go 500 5 000
fold, markers will really determine answer well point future.
love continue discussion around topic stress, specifically yeah um,
maybe will get little bit later today um get use deliberate
cold exposure, that’s certainly um effects related directly temperature
tissue. certainly mental effects terms raising one's level perceived pain. It’s
fun um, people love people love feeling get it.
Um deliberate cold exposure. people like feeling get not
unlike exercise totally. love train. love exercise, know many people uh um.
loathe exercise, love feeling afterward. will theme will
come back to. Thank indulging interest

00:40:36 4 Recovery Levels, Enhance Recovery

semi-tangent, think it’s relevant tangent thing, can now return
us different time, scales, yeah modes recovery, think
headed get better recovery. Yep. talk tools, talk
measure identify four distinct levels, level one call
overload just quickly means is. workout today. sign
symptom overload fatigued. Acute performance down, worked hard right
now. go, try maximum effort, reduced ability.
recovery period acute overload minutes days right. That’s generally, call


acute overload that’s looking right. systems theoretically
see hormetic stressor come back response, come back, bigger, better, efficient,
Etc. continue training state, like us, say workout
today, little bit acute overload going work tomorrow. little acute
overload can work next day little acute overload. Even took day
it’s doesn't matter right, just continue acute bouts insult
going pushing absolute golden Target, call functional
overreaching. reached can currently results
functional outcome, mean functionally performance enhanced
performance whatever deem stronger, you've, enhanced
muscle size, mitochondria improved you've, whatever thing is, it’s not just
physical performance thing right, amazing, recovery time functional overreaching
typically days maybe even week so, typically, see happen
prior competition. Individuals will call taper, reduced training
volume short period time, reason do. again.
Actualize phrase year adaptations, worked hard six
weeks know, theoretically, workouts. three four five six weeks ago,
allow, system recover will actualized, means performance will
enhanced. functional overreaching golden Target. Okay,
point functional overreaching - continue train intensified whether
intensity volume really. said earlier, something
holding back recovery. doesn't really matter right. It’s it’s sort two sides
coin. move call non-functional overreaching
reached again, now non-functional not see positive benefit
recovery allowed. typically means weeks takes weeks come back from,
basically just get back Baseline, lot folks end
vicious cycle, like man, not getting results. want. going train
harder, not getting results. want going train harder harder,
caught recovery isn't improved, just end spot. train
end spot end up. just either blowing quitting
not getting want. continue past point, may
actually actually call training typically, considered
trained takes months recover people think trained really
not you're. Just probably non-functionally overreached classic distinction is,
took three four days off felt better, weren't, probably quote unquote
trained. probably just area non-functional reaching. need little bit


back off - case. happen gymnasts
cheerleader things take month off barely seeing
start come back Baseline numbers. number areas, mood desire
train testosterone, cortisol ratios biomarkers number areas - physical performance,
vertical jump height, like things just start get back Baseline, true
training actually quite rare. Non-Functional overreaching much common
shorter time frame scale. talk recovery, four pieces
really thinking about, so, concerned about, oh super sore.
get less sore? either not sore next time? workout
super sorry. Now. recover playing first category overload
can certainly talk figure out. quick answer got go back
previous episodes just pay attention volume intensity recommendations
getting significantly uh damage fatigue workout? probably
increased volume quickly, something else dragging stress bucket down,
generally, problem training. Um either didn't warm sufficiently.
fueling strategy off talk Next Episode violated. One
principles increasing intensity volume sort quickly, it’s past
getting stage you're, just like feeling beat time energy going
down, just not feeling like recovered. Now overreaching stage,
story kind tell always years ago working wife Natasha
garage training something like comes stumbling
look Eyes like eyeballs, giant she's, just like wobbling she's.
Like effed up, like mean like effed she's? Just like, read
program wrong like Trump like what'd. like supposed
10 sets three every minute minute three sets ten every minute
minute absolutely wrecked. couldn't move hours afterwards
days, she's. Just like handle kids like, can't get bed.
can't move like classic example right like don't need fix recovery
here, you're, just dummy, dream way hard long like not
don't problem here. it’s situation like that, it’s generally just program
way off. it’s constantly happening you're, just like man like whatever reason,
every while, getting really sore really bad performance
workouts, need go stress bucket. Take look allostatic load
allostasis get figured happening um.




00:48:19 Overreaching vs. Overtraining

happy pointed distinction functional overreaching, training
trained. think one one common mistake people make thinking
biology generally think terms nouns adjectives not verbs amazing.
love much know, biology collection processes processes depending
live, trained trained state that,
many ways, adjective trained trained. It’s like saying, uh,
know American, know Czechoslovakian whatever happens, right
many ways people start associate identity, least transient identity,
start making sorts decisions. sounds like sorts verbs will
will not engage in, whereas think look things processes assign verbs
them, can say: okay, functionally overreaching truly training,
matter Degrees, correct right training matter, not reaching,
not functionally reaching it’s just it’s just performance, know, just
nervous system, won't change unless give reason reason why,
can Perform something perfectly speak language perfectly. no rewiring
nervous system. myth told every experience rewires
nervous system, it’s different now two seconds ago. That’s that’s ridiculous,
illogical statement. know. That’s not true nervous system can perform something,
no reason change won't muscles way.
progressively overload learn something new challenge muscle
something new, it’s thing. example gave uh wife
workout turned far strenuous, functionally overreach.
sense, might training heading direction training,
mistake assume trained right, kind it’s almost becomes
bit state character assignment um, opposed verb, case,
no perfect way describe - talking nouns adjectives also
um talking verbs. think verbs really anchored processes
things actions can take um. may, like just highlight this,
idea shifting one sinking towards verb actions rather labels state
happen person happen right. Sometimes even become
kind character. Logical way people describe uh, believe
something called training training real words,
don't ever really know trained, nailed it. there's. No, know it’s
not like red flag. Uh, know shoots shoulder say trained.


know it’s um, so, hope can start thinking verbs,
actions can take order ensure stimulate Progressive, overload
one way another time, don't fall bins character
assignment suddenly decide need X like take month off
something like that, beginning realize um discussion that’s
exactly wrong way go. fantastic points want make sure clear
no clinical diagnosis training. no standards, no test
blood panel. can pull. actually identify state.
distinction Here, Andrew verbs, rather nouns is, wonderful
exactly case. way really come retroactively, diagnose
one training is, had. weeks recovery got back
Baseline, can't moment. can't take single test, no subjective
marker anything says trained. simply, probably training,
need reverse quickly case step probably non-
functionally overreaching. continue this, will probably enter new stage
training need come back. that’s important thing
let people know no one thing actually point says

00:52:53 Tool: Acute Overload & Recovery, Breathwork

not noun, verb. tools can use
enhance recovery yep? start off acute overload phase. So, words,
just workout feeling awful just one two days ago super sore.
get rid right now? Well, couple things can immediately
workout others maybe actionable day later two days
later just cover handful them. nutrition hydration
supplementation next episode. going cover everything else, not category
right now, couple things number one. can actually start Kickstart recovery
process end current training session, guess say way.
strongly suggest start recovery process immediately workout
mentioned earlier idea got get really high peak stress cause
adaptation, actually didn't explain correctly, happen
need extremely High peak, met extremely sharp
recovery back down, know talked
neuroplasticity stuff terms happen caused insult.


immediately need able recover make sure causes changes brains
thing happens here. need really sharp high inflammatory response
then, not meet immediate recovery period, signal won't
maximize results. mean can actually couple things? Number
one actually listening slow, paced, music evidence suggest fast-paced music
may slow recovery slow pace actually enhance it. just change
know maximum get get going music workout
slower, lower Cadence will help kick start idea similar note. can also
use call regulation breathing. conjunction one
other, whichever you, personal favorite method somewhere
three ten minutes finishing training session. Laying like
position, certainly Lotus position, think laying back
generally effective personal preference there, no science, like items
covered getting dark quiet sort area Then, just breathing nose
structured, Cadence, lot different things. can try easy example. just
box breathing can imagine box four squares. going
inhale somewhere between, like three eight seconds whatever number
choose, keep tempo, say chose five second inhale,
that’s going take vertically horizontally box five second hold
five second exhale five second hold, just need repeat
time domain. Now typically honestly don't use timer you'll, actually notice. lot
people will like fall asleep get really close falling asleep period. can
triangle version that, inhale, hold exhale go right back
inhale bunch different tricks. can try here, need play around
see actually works best you. Um 10 minutes probably better, can just
least give three that'll work, really really resistant, can actually that. Just
shower, going finish workout get shower again, just close
eyes shower, give three minutes focused relaxation breathing will
accelerate recovery process. love particularly love laboratory
works stress respiration, okay, breathing interactions two
just mention result just accepted publication, time day.
uh. Thank you. Uh beautiful work uh, not directly, although took
place lab, know, it’s students doctors um, Dr Melise uh, balbon
uh lab. It’s phenomenal researcher showed short period five minutes
box breathing exactly type described cyclic sign two inhales, followed
extended exhale lungs empty. Ideally, inhales done nose.


exhales done. Uh mouth, although done nose, um
mouth matter, probably nose. Nose inhale, inhale mouth exhale
um uh inhales, nose exhale nose. Cyclic sighing,
refer done five minutes, produce significant decreases resting
heart rate. time will increase things like heart rate, variability
forth. Um provided extended exhales. seems like calming response,
reduction overall stress occurs. thing really sends things
direction something like cyclic hyperventilation. sure observed um
interestingly uh, people just five minutes meditation which,
which, course, breathing just allowing breathing progress.
However, happens moment, um moments across five minutes uh.
reductions sorts markers stress described not significant
breathing. love Brock's breathing tool, post, workout, um
Alternatives too, just mentioned, think people greatly underestimate
potency breathing shifting one's nervous system function away stress one
wants toward alertness stress. actually couple questions
sure. think audience appreciate uh. long boxes? just
user selected great question, use carbon dioxide tolerance test amazing order
people determine long different sides Box be, cover
carbon dioxide tolerance tests. previous episode, can provide link clip um
show, note captions, but, point out, involves long extended exhale lungs,
empty um and, course, people sit lungs empty, accurately
Faithfully say report long took empty lungs. use
gauge. Typically, takes, people go lungs empty 20 seconds less, believe
go back paper look, believe duration sides
boxes were, somewhere um two three seconds,
CO2 discard time anywhere uh 20 seconds 40 45 seconds, use it.
sides box, believe, four six seconds people
longer discard Arrow period minute more. used
box duration inhale, hold exhale, hold duration somewhere between. believe
[ Music, ], um, seven, maybe eight long 11 12 seconds yeah.
will get kind free diver types. can really this? really well
trained sort thing? don't quote exactly numbers,
approximate. line exactly done. believe it’s it’s going
close within seconds non-important Distinction. it’s going close enough,
that’s great, uh. took six weeks. study done


period month swapped new pattern breathing um,
condition meditation condition - done natural world, say, um
wearing whoop bands. getting heart rate, heart rate, variability, sleep,
data, subjective data mood Etc. lot measures, um
100 subjects wild life um tried best track life, stress
events exercise, things like harder control outside laboratory.
Really results speak exactly exactly describing here,
deliberate respiration involves controlled holds exhales really dramatic
immediate impact reducing levels stress. That’s wonderful! not surprised
findings really interesting that, mentioned
exhalation portion primarily responsible regulation that’s actually goes
back previous endurance conversation, general rest, non-altitude
increases Co2 primary driver ventilation, generally means
inhales associated uptick sympathetic State exhales associated
uptick parasympathetic State. generally, folks will things like exhale
finish exhale right perform high Precision, neurological tasks.
going say, aim Target shoot going Exhale fully almost
always execute movement end exhale, that’s
highest parasympathetic State lowest drive ventilation. say not surprised
guys found actually data point individuals, particularly
endurance. Training can get back Baseline heart rate going
correlated with. gets actual results training. Said take
bunch individuals put endurance training program,
measure quickly can get back Baseline workout general,
folks better going see greater improvements Performance
end say, four six eight week, training block little bit
causation correlation untie. think it’s enough say: hey
invest three case study five minutes. It’s going
enhance recovery, likelihood increasing results training, now
also additional benefits like able transition appropriately next
task, going work going see family whatever thing is, it’s it’s nice close to,
asked high, sympathetic State body, asked perform
stress. gave recovery now ready transition next thing
don't take exercise energy. will next

01:03:39 Tool: Alleviate Acute Soreness, Compression Clothing



task may may not want sympathetic Drive state. somebody sore
following workout, either locally sore muscle, group group muscles, maybe
legs chest torso maybe whole body sore sometimes case.
tools can Implement order accelerate the? want call
moving soreness, it’s really, know, alleviation soreness
bunch different processes. effective tools push back
soreness dissipate yeah? Absolutely. First all, it’s not lactate! That’s just really
important thing still hear people talk about. know sore 24 hours later
got thing get lactate there, talked metabolism,
uh conversation episode not cause fatigue it’s certainly not
cause soreness. not actionable tip there, just pet peeve mine. hear
people say get irritated can maybe end conversation um strategies,
tools, can do, can actually wear compression gear will help little
bit. decent amount evidence, suggesting, just you, know, put
tighter fitting clothes Leisure, wear compression gear. can
actually prevent little bit soreness occurring. case poor
Natasha - realize just done way way much went hung
bow hunting friend trained way hard, realize, oh, goodness,
going sore here. can immediately put compression gear weigh
really long possible. examples compression gear? seen
people plane high high socks um, mean anything wear
compression gear exercise. whether just know,
compression pants leggings tight fitting leggings uh, whether long sleeve
shirt, that’s like rash guard, wear know Jiu, Jitsu surfing, something
like that. long it’s tight fitting, doesn't much can wear.
suppose get socks, great, generally just tell leads them.
put long sleeve compression shirts wear training
long, compression, leggings that'd fine. Can people apply compression
um Garb training still get positive effects yeah? not seen
evidence suggest block adaptation. may case. not aware
studies happens, certainly know information suggests can
hands little bit Muscle Recovery. ideally one knows workout
trigger lot soreness yeah compression gear sort
offset that, local muscle groups working
Reason asked socks understanding. socks uh, compression


socks people plane it’s going shift patterns blood flow, not just
lower legs, body yeah you're, probably going want focus
actual exercising tissue, though, Actually, that’s really good question. don't know
answer whether not upper body workout lower body compression
gear. actually help that’s great question. may done. don't know,
don't know answer general, just tell people like where, whole
thing much can um, actually not concerned wearing
workout. something put afterwards even wear just little bit
compression day. Um actually really fun study. Uh. collaborated
um Bill Kramer who's. Uh, know, Sports scientist Year award. bill Cramer
award, gives indication uh University Connecticut, well Lee
Brown, two Lifetime Achievement Award winners put people plane
stores, Connecticut flew Cal State Fullerton. cross-country flight
got wear compression gear flight others not,
landed California training bout put back plane, went back stores
think another training bout got back there. lot data
came paper, one things clear compression group
effective handling blood related coagulation issues associated
long flights particularly athletic performance. that’s actually sneaky little Insider trick
use lot people, particularly athletes traveling, just wear
compression gear plane. talked sort rung study
mind another effective strategy, compression gear general, well
particularly plane, basically tighter can get better, without obviously
making hands purple uncomfortable things like that, doesn't
overly tight. Anything will work probably help. also personally,
anytime, taking

01:08:27 Tool: Acute Soreness, Massage, Temperature

flight like much can just feel little better get there.
methods can use alleviate acute soreness? Well, continue
theme, saying okay, use sort pressure manipulation
enhance recovery. compression one strategy, can also use things like compression
boots garments, nomadic devices will know, pump uh air outside
compress back forth. number devices will this. can


also use physical hand, massage body work they're, really
working best. can tell mechanisms effectively moving fluid
tissue, well potentially enhancing blood flow, increasing capitalization
going get nutrients waste products out. can kind pick
choose based upon budget preferences availability timing, things like that,
effective strategies outside really next largest category, now
thermal uh, far discussion, mentioned cold water, Immersion
talked hypertrophy section not want immediately: post
exercise, getting cold water ice bath trying grow muscle
mass. said that, good evidence showing cold water immersion
specifically effective reducing muscle soreness. fair consideration it’s
classic example no free passes physiology. Nothing always good
always bad. It’s always willing give versus willing
get case like cold water immersion? may thinking yeah. might want
hypertrophic adaptations, phase training,
actually trying push towards optimization moment, rather long-term
adaptation, ice bath might great choice. addition, fall scenario
like Natasha - realize like just unbelievably sore - might cost three
four five six days training. might worth accelerate recovery
process couple days don't miss much training. it’s just it’s
algorithm, it’s equation. looking season trying compete
just done way way much exercise, really significant pain.
probably willing give small percentage eventual muscle growth
single session get pain cold strategies. Cold water immersion clearly
best approach rather cold air tactics. cold shower probably
not enough here. really want either moderately cold. maybe 40 50
degree, water probably north 15 minutes can sub 40 little maybe
five minutes get fact number studies um.
sort summarizing bunch kind one rather going Point
point. numbers just threw uh, assuming um uh Fahrenheit um,
seem seem really cold right uncomfortably cold. Absolutely always recommend
people ease protocol overall not immediately go 35 degree uh
cold water, never done uh. said, people comfortable
uncomfortable, always answer question: cold exactly?
agree very, cold much really really want get out,
able stay safely? Whatever value happens be, absolutely


need safe. said that, actually, xbt Retreats, put dozens, not
hundreds people point, uh immediately sub 35 degree water first time
ever done. know three minutes multiple rounds session, can handle it.
don't need go crazy. don't want kind play game right,
want really really cold short amount time, want like kind
cold longer amount time? really mistake can make
something like know, 65 degree water people not comfortable
know five ten minutes. It’s just not going be. It’s probably not going
effective. like man 35 is, absolutely crazy want 55 degree, water
literature area. it’s going say need probably
somewhere, almost really north 10 minutes, will actually show need
like well north 20 30 minutes. money rather go really really
cold get done five minutes, um personal preference one. can also
make little bit easier yourself. not nearly much evidence,
contrast. Stuff uh, go cold, hot sort back forth.
no really good rules terms much go, many rounds, long
cold long hot couple studies obviously
studies use numbers, doesn't mean tested See optimal,
big difference, can really just kind play feel hot good
Recovery. just careful going put blood flow
area, may walk additional acute swelling isn't going
put greater pressure there. kind play that. personally really like
hot Recovery. will feel - maybe not great moment, next day tend feel
really really good. addition, wake next morning really really hurting
super stiff, hot bath will help um quite bit, can play
protocols. Again, don't

01:14:21 Cold & Heat Contrast, Cold Shower vs. Immersion, Sauna & Fertility

nice absolutely no requirement so. just option interested
studies Dr Susanna soberg sure yeah not directly aimed alleviating soreness
recovery, increasing thermal capacity storage uh Brown adipose
tissue, not blubbery fat stuff around clavicles around heart help
generate body, heat rest metabolism on, numbers um
come not tested possible derivations just like


breathing. five minute sessions, knows? Maybe minute
equally effective. just constraints sorts studies, values
come with, seem good thresholds making sure
adaptation response triggered heat cold. ends 57 minutes per week,
total uncomfortable safe heat case sauna, can one session
breaking couple sessions day different days, 11
minutes per week. cold either one single session multiple sessions, one
um one break know multiple days one day
one. know hour sauna 11 minutes colder vice versa,
although seems little bit extreme, especially uninitiated.
numbers studied. point out, not lot really thorough
studies examining different cold protocols according temperature time requirements.
bit subjective, feel required establish routine, actually say
another time re-emphasize something. talked beginning
conversation, pain not defined outcome. It’s heavily influenced
perception, so, don't feel like work you, won't work. feel like
work fantastic, so. It’s challenging field get really objective data
always going little bit subjective nature. things, can tell
anecdotally: used hot cold contrast long time athletes. love
don't care everything between. it’s one things never
mandate it. course, can't mandate anything anyone work with, never
know like hey. interested great struggling area? want try this?
liked great struggling area, tried it. didn't love it.
Okay, fine, not find routes, will get lot ways enhance
recovery um. one hasn't even really come stopping problem
first place, not just treating symptoms, first line defense,
really need go back figure it’s happening begin with, Solution,
just different acute symptom management tactics. One final point uh,
deliberate, cold exposure. think worth mentioning one reasons shower
effective, not nearly effective cold water, immersion immersion ice
neck simply reason stated before, showers not
going get cold not going get know sub 40s. Also cold
showers haven't really studied much have, not nearly much
immersion people always ask just think challenges studying cold water
exposure shower, can't really control mango? much body
covered, whether not head stays different size bodies, Etc? Whereas


people come laboratory, can get cold large, know neck
is. know chin can make sure people's arms um legs
underneath, cold shower sure can make everyone face away toward
shower, it’s really tricky um variations described. said,
agree one wants use deliberate cold exposure, cold shower better
nothing cold immersion circulating, cold water ice bath better um
cold shower yeah? actually say looking recovery muscle soreness,
say cold shower, probably little, not going able
get enough cold water onto muscle, besides, basically head, maybe
try cold bath least get surface area coverage, yeah want
use cold shower awesome reasons cold shower. That’s totally great.
trying use recover low back glutes sore training
good way, it’s probably not going much immersion there.
actually also hit sneaky point, is, can't get water super cold, just
make water move. Jets stuff can turn anyone tried
like. Okay, can 40 degree. Bath awesome, try 60, water
moving right, break thermal layer. Normally little thin layer
water heating up. break up. It’s whole new world, yeah, absolutely
still cold. Water actually weaker way go correct can make
face stoic, make body circulate water around long
this. Maybe just one point heat uh: certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry,
sauna, steam saunas. Excuse me, jacuzzis can work pretty well yep um uh males.
looking conceive 60 days following uh uh following sauna um, hot tub realize
approaches severely limit number motile sperm um
substantially. people not trying conceive uh. Don'T think works
reliably enough, use form contraception yeah, people
trying conceive. really detrimental sperm Health right reason
people bring ice pack put groin near groin go
um, hard hot tub sauna. getting fine points,
um crude points, will pun intended, um, idea wouldn't want
anyone approach techniques compromise life goals, certainly not
allowed anywhere near things. uh, stage Life, just say
Natasha put x hanging Laird. reasons, like you're, not
going you're, not going none stuff, just wait right heat um heat


sperm relationship it’s not one that’s positive sperm


01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques

ways combine various types stimuli described inducing
recovery? talked breathing based tools which, adjust indeed
adjust oxygen carbon dioxide ratios Etc. guessing major effect
recovery going neural. It’s going deliberate, calm nervous system,
sympathetic, based uh, mentioned, yeah definitely, talked
movement based touch-based approaches. Um, will uh movement
circulate, certainly will circulate blood, also will generate contractions muscles yep
right, maybe, if, indeed again, still speculates you, indeed soreness
due excessive stretch swelling stretch, ends muscles
make sense movement touch thermal, ways combine
um effective maybe even synergistic yeah. suppose throw uh
compression garments put Pneumatic compression device sit sauna.
regulate breath like fine. Quite honestly, though,
probably don't need maximize them. joking. probably go
light swim regulating breathing cold water. get compression
cold, water good spot, certainly that. reality
is. generally look physical approach holistic approach breath
work. Basically, want breath something else knock two things
good spot, breath thermal stress, just
controlling unregulation stuff. also remember ice stressor
actually show data second actually can enhance
systemic recovery, although won't happen acute minutes. fact, it’s going
take least 30 60 minutes eventually see rebound effect, acutely it’s
going make actually sympathetic, going direction. can
opposite can actually drive up. it’s little bit dependent upon
respond, time day you're, using general, guess combining
need um, depending available. perhaps don't
sauna, can take hot bath great. Maybe percussion device
tool can use that. don't sauna amazing. don't ice bath


things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food

Long-Term adaptation, others going want careful
principle laid us, set events occur
exercise trigger adaptation sets motion number adaptations
occur recovery give us exact opposite response trigger
go back heart rate example: um heart rate close maximal maximal.
enough times within short know week two weeks resting
heart rate goes down. recall episodes ago, said maximum heart rate
doesn't really change. much. correct? Yes, okay, resting heart rate can
go quite bit yep. general theme meaning less set
upper limit ceiling things like inflammatory markers heart rate, maybe even things
like stress deliberately trigger stress dramatic increase
heart rate dramatic Increase inflammatory markers lowering floor,
ceiling Remains Same. It’s dependent upon marker, case
maximum heart rate, will not change exception one thing age, brings
down. Training will not change circumstances. look something like
inflammatory response, suppose, theoretically, ceiling, though not aware
um. can tell right now, looking blood markers, things like creatine kinase,
remember conversation metabolism use phosphocreatine
one primary fuel sources explosive exercise. Well, using phosphocreatine
creatine kinase, remember, kinase enzymes function break things
part, creatine kinase enzyme use break creatine
that. lot, creatine kinase gets muscle seeps blood
myoglobin actually another fantastic marker. way, myoglobin is, think
hemoglobin blood, molecule carries oxygen around it’s
muscle tissue. it’s myoglobin mild, meaning muscle it’s globulin thing.
bunch markers can look muscle breakdown one things
can see creatine kinase level. That’s elevated say, um, one bout exercise and,
might, might up. know five six-fold. actually seen number
offensive lineman NFL, something like 500 plus fold, even within just one
category next. number can get extraordinarily high know actually
one important Point here, paying attention mechanistic research
use you're, using inform decision making, extraordinarily careful
magnitude Mean is, running western blot looking
signaling protein um muscle uh activation protein turn mitochondrial
biogenesis, saw whatever intervention gave it, whether nutrition thing
drug exercise - saw signaling protein increased 20 percent.


basically assume totally physiologically irrelevant, order
important, totally depends market looking at, markers
might need see four five six hundred fold increase before. know will actually
enough call physiologically relevant others one two percent
relevant, really want careful either reading papers
looking Social Media stuff. people just talking this, marker increase much,
may not matter, may totally irrelevant physiologically,
also, wondering like hell are, people. Well, that’s can
trick little bit intentionally not. just trying best,
don't really understand area enough, that’s important point pay attention to.
So. answer question fully, hard determine truly
maximum level um. things don't want move like blood pH. doesn't really want
move range going move from, know like 6.8 7.4, get
like 7.9, like you're, probably big big big trouble, things can go 500 5 000
fold, markers will really determine answer well point future.
love continue discussion around topic stress, specifically yeah um,
maybe will get little bit later today um get use deliberate
cold exposure, that’s certainly um effects related directly temperature
tissue. certainly mental effects terms raising one's level perceived pain. It’s
fun um, people love people love feeling get it.
Um deliberate cold exposure. people like feeling get not
unlike exercise totally. love train. love exercise, know many people uh um.
loathe exercise, love feeling afterward. will theme will
come back to. Thank indulging interest

00:40:36 4 Recovery Levels, Enhance Recovery

semi-tangent, think it’s relevant tangent thing, can now return
us different time, scales, yeah modes recovery, think
headed get better recovery. Yep. talk tools, talk
measure identify four distinct levels, level one call
overload just quickly means is. workout today. sign
symptom overload fatigued. Acute performance down, worked hard right
now. go, try maximum effort, reduced ability.
recovery period acute overload minutes days right. That’s generally, call


acute overload that’s looking right. systems theoretically
see hormetic stressor come back response, come back, bigger, better, efficient,
Etc. continue training state, like us, say workout
today, little bit acute overload going work tomorrow. little acute
overload can work next day little acute overload. Even took day
it’s doesn't matter right, just continue acute bouts insult
going pushing absolute golden Target, call functional
overreaching. reached can currently results
functional outcome, mean functionally performance enhanced
performance whatever deem stronger, you've, enhanced
muscle size, mitochondria improved you've, whatever thing is, it’s not just
physical performance thing right, amazing, recovery time functional overreaching
typically days maybe even week so, typically, see happen
prior competition. Individuals will call taper, reduced training
volume short period time, reason do. again.
Actualize phrase year adaptations, worked hard six
weeks know, theoretically, workouts. three four five six weeks ago,
allow, system recover will actualized, means performance will
enhanced. functional overreaching golden Target. Okay,
point functional overreaching - continue train intensified whether
intensity volume really. said earlier, something
holding back recovery. doesn't really matter right. It’s it’s sort two sides
coin. move call non-functional overreaching
reached again, now non-functional not see positive benefit
recovery allowed. typically means weeks takes weeks come back from,
basically just get back Baseline, lot folks end
vicious cycle, like man, not getting results. want. going train
harder, not getting results. want going train harder harder,
caught recovery isn't improved, just end spot. train
end spot end up. just either blowing quitting
not getting want. continue past point, may
actually actually call training typically, considered
trained takes months recover people think trained really
not you're. Just probably non-functionally overreached classic distinction is,
took three four days off felt better, weren't, probably quote unquote
trained. probably just area non-functional reaching. need little bit


back off - case. happen gymnasts
cheerleader things take month off barely seeing
start come back Baseline numbers. number areas, mood desire
train testosterone, cortisol ratios biomarkers number areas - physical performance,
vertical jump height, like things just start get back Baseline, true
training actually quite rare. Non-Functional overreaching much common
shorter time frame scale. talk recovery, four pieces
really thinking about, so, concerned about, oh super sore.
get less sore? either not sore next time? workout
super sorry. Now. recover playing first category overload
can certainly talk figure out. quick answer got go back
previous episodes just pay attention volume intensity recommendations
getting significantly uh damage fatigue workout? probably
increased volume quickly, something else dragging stress bucket down,
generally, problem training. Um either didn't warm sufficiently.
fueling strategy off talk Next Episode violated. One
principles increasing intensity volume sort quickly, it’s past
getting stage you're, just like feeling beat time energy going
down, just not feeling like recovered. Now overreaching stage,
story kind tell always years ago working wife Natasha
garage training something like comes stumbling
look Eyes like eyeballs, giant she's, just like wobbling she's.
Like effed up, like mean like effed she's? Just like, read
program wrong like Trump like what'd. like supposed
10 sets three every minute minute three sets ten every minute
minute absolutely wrecked. couldn't move hours afterwards
days, she's. Just like handle kids like, can't get bed.
can't move like classic example right like don't need fix recovery
here, you're, just dummy, dream way hard long like not
don't problem here. it’s situation like that, it’s generally just program
way off. it’s constantly happening you're, just like man like whatever reason,
every while, getting really sore really bad performance
workouts, need go stress bucket. Take look allostatic load
allostasis get figured happening um.




00:48:19 Overreaching vs. Overtraining

happy pointed distinction functional overreaching, training
trained. think one one common mistake people make thinking
biology generally think terms nouns adjectives not verbs amazing.
love much know, biology collection processes processes depending
live, trained trained state that,
many ways, adjective trained trained. It’s like saying, uh,
know American, know Czechoslovakian whatever happens, right
many ways people start associate identity, least transient identity,
start making sorts decisions. sounds like sorts verbs will
will not engage in, whereas think look things processes assign verbs
them, can say: okay, functionally overreaching truly training,
matter Degrees, correct right training matter, not reaching,
not functionally reaching it’s just it’s just performance, know, just
nervous system, won't change unless give reason reason why,
can Perform something perfectly speak language perfectly. no rewiring
nervous system. myth told every experience rewires
nervous system, it’s different now two seconds ago. That’s that’s ridiculous,
illogical statement. know. That’s not true nervous system can perform something,
no reason change won't muscles way.
progressively overload learn something new challenge muscle
something new, it’s thing. example gave uh wife
workout turned far strenuous, functionally overreach.
sense, might training heading direction training,
mistake assume trained right, kind it’s almost becomes
bit state character assignment um, opposed verb, case,
no perfect way describe - talking nouns adjectives also
um talking verbs. think verbs really anchored processes
things actions can take um. may, like just highlight this,
idea shifting one sinking towards verb actions rather labels state
happen person happen right. Sometimes even become
kind character. Logical way people describe uh, believe
something called training training real words,
don't ever really know trained, nailed it. there's. No, know it’s
not like red flag. Uh, know shoots shoulder say trained.


know it’s um, so, hope can start thinking verbs,
actions can take order ensure stimulate Progressive, overload
one way another time, don't fall bins character
assignment suddenly decide need X like take month off
something like that, beginning realize um discussion that’s
exactly wrong way go. fantastic points want make sure clear
no clinical diagnosis training. no standards, no test
blood panel. can pull. actually identify state.
distinction Here, Andrew verbs, rather nouns is, wonderful
exactly case. way really come retroactively, diagnose
one training is, had. weeks recovery got back
Baseline, can't moment. can't take single test, no subjective
marker anything says trained. simply, probably training,
need reverse quickly case step probably non-
functionally overreaching. continue this, will probably enter new stage
training need come back. that’s important thing
let people know no one thing actually point says

00:52:53 Tool: Acute Overload & Recovery, Breathwork

not noun, verb. tools can use
enhance recovery yep? start off acute overload phase. So, words,
just workout feeling awful just one two days ago super sore.
get rid right now? Well, couple things can immediately
workout others maybe actionable day later two days
later just cover handful them. nutrition hydration
supplementation next episode. going cover everything else, not category
right now, couple things number one. can actually start Kickstart recovery
process end current training session, guess say way.
strongly suggest start recovery process immediately workout
mentioned earlier idea got get really high peak stress cause
adaptation, actually didn't explain correctly, happen
need extremely High peak, met extremely sharp
recovery back down, know talked
neuroplasticity stuff terms happen caused insult.


immediately need able recover make sure causes changes brains
thing happens here. need really sharp high inflammatory response
then, not meet immediate recovery period, signal won't
maximize results. mean can actually couple things? Number
one actually listening slow, paced, music evidence suggest fast-paced music
may slow recovery slow pace actually enhance it. just change
know maximum get get going music workout
slower, lower Cadence will help kick start idea similar note. can also
use call regulation breathing. conjunction one
other, whichever you, personal favorite method somewhere
three ten minutes finishing training session. Laying like
position, certainly Lotus position, think laying back
generally effective personal preference there, no science, like items
covered getting dark quiet sort area Then, just breathing nose
structured, Cadence, lot different things. can try easy example. just
box breathing can imagine box four squares. going
inhale somewhere between, like three eight seconds whatever number
choose, keep tempo, say chose five second inhale,
that’s going take vertically horizontally box five second hold
five second exhale five second hold, just need repeat
time domain. Now typically honestly don't use timer you'll, actually notice. lot
people will like fall asleep get really close falling asleep period. can
triangle version that, inhale, hold exhale go right back
inhale bunch different tricks. can try here, need play around
see actually works best you. Um 10 minutes probably better, can just
least give three that'll work, really really resistant, can actually that. Just
shower, going finish workout get shower again, just close
eyes shower, give three minutes focused relaxation breathing will
accelerate recovery process. love particularly love laboratory
works stress respiration, okay, breathing interactions two
just mention result just accepted publication, time day.
uh. Thank you. Uh beautiful work uh, not directly, although took
place lab, know, it’s students doctors um, Dr Melise uh, balbon
uh lab. It’s phenomenal researcher showed short period five minutes
box breathing exactly type described cyclic sign two inhales, followed
extended exhale lungs empty. Ideally, inhales done nose.


exhales done. Uh mouth, although done nose, um
mouth matter, probably nose. Nose inhale, inhale mouth exhale
um uh inhales, nose exhale nose. Cyclic sighing,
refer done five minutes, produce significant decreases resting
heart rate. time will increase things like heart rate, variability
forth. Um provided extended exhales. seems like calming response,
reduction overall stress occurs. thing really sends things
direction something like cyclic hyperventilation. sure observed um
interestingly uh, people just five minutes meditation which,
which, course, breathing just allowing breathing progress.
However, happens moment, um moments across five minutes uh.
reductions sorts markers stress described not significant
breathing. love Brock's breathing tool, post, workout, um
Alternatives too, just mentioned, think people greatly underestimate
potency breathing shifting one's nervous system function away stress one
wants toward alertness stress. actually couple questions
sure. think audience appreciate uh. long boxes? just
user selected great question, use carbon dioxide tolerance test amazing order
people determine long different sides Box be, cover
carbon dioxide tolerance tests. previous episode, can provide link clip um
show, note captions, but, point out, involves long extended exhale lungs,
empty um and, course, people sit lungs empty, accurately
Faithfully say report long took empty lungs. use
gauge. Typically, takes, people go lungs empty 20 seconds less, believe
go back paper look, believe duration sides
boxes were, somewhere um two three seconds,
CO2 discard time anywhere uh 20 seconds 40 45 seconds, use it.
sides box, believe, four six seconds people
longer discard Arrow period minute more. used
box duration inhale, hold exhale, hold duration somewhere between. believe
[ Music, ], um, seven, maybe eight long 11 12 seconds yeah.
will get kind free diver types. can really this? really well
trained sort thing? don't quote exactly numbers,
approximate. line exactly done. believe it’s it’s going
close within seconds non-important Distinction. it’s going close enough,
that’s great, uh. took six weeks. study done


period month swapped new pattern breathing um,
condition meditation condition - done natural world, say, um
wearing whoop bands. getting heart rate, heart rate, variability, sleep,
data, subjective data mood Etc. lot measures, um
100 subjects wild life um tried best track life, stress
events exercise, things like harder control outside laboratory.
Really results speak exactly exactly describing here,
deliberate respiration involves controlled holds exhales really dramatic
immediate impact reducing levels stress. That’s wonderful! not surprised
findings really interesting that, mentioned
exhalation portion primarily responsible regulation that’s actually goes
back previous endurance conversation, general rest, non-altitude
increases Co2 primary driver ventilation, generally means
inhales associated uptick sympathetic State exhales associated
uptick parasympathetic State. generally, folks will things like exhale
finish exhale right perform high Precision, neurological tasks.
going say, aim Target shoot going Exhale fully almost
always execute movement end exhale, that’s
highest parasympathetic State lowest drive ventilation. say not surprised
guys found actually data point individuals, particularly
endurance. Training can get back Baseline heart rate going
correlated with. gets actual results training. Said take
bunch individuals put endurance training program,
measure quickly can get back Baseline workout general,
folks better going see greater improvements Performance
end say, four six eight week, training block little bit
causation correlation untie. think it’s enough say: hey
invest three case study five minutes. It’s going
enhance recovery, likelihood increasing results training, now
also additional benefits like able transition appropriately next
task, going work going see family whatever thing is, it’s it’s nice close to,
asked high, sympathetic State body, asked perform
stress. gave recovery now ready transition next thing
don't take exercise energy. will next

01:03:39 Tool: Alleviate Acute Soreness, Compression Clothing



task may may not want sympathetic Drive state. somebody sore
following workout, either locally sore muscle, group group muscles, maybe
legs chest torso maybe whole body sore sometimes case.
tools can Implement order accelerate the? want call
moving soreness, it’s really, know, alleviation soreness
bunch different processes. effective tools push back
soreness dissipate yeah? Absolutely. First all, it’s not lactate! That’s just really
important thing still hear people talk about. know sore 24 hours later
got thing get lactate there, talked metabolism,
uh conversation episode not cause fatigue it’s certainly not
cause soreness. not actionable tip there, just pet peeve mine. hear
people say get irritated can maybe end conversation um strategies,
tools, can do, can actually wear compression gear will help little
bit. decent amount evidence, suggesting, just you, know, put
tighter fitting clothes Leisure, wear compression gear. can
actually prevent little bit soreness occurring. case poor
Natasha - realize just done way way much went hung
bow hunting friend trained way hard, realize, oh, goodness,
going sore here. can immediately put compression gear weigh
really long possible. examples compression gear? seen
people plane high high socks um, mean anything wear
compression gear exercise. whether just know,
compression pants leggings tight fitting leggings uh, whether long sleeve
shirt, that’s like rash guard, wear know Jiu, Jitsu surfing, something
like that. long it’s tight fitting, doesn't much can wear.
suppose get socks, great, generally just tell leads them.
put long sleeve compression shirts wear training
long, compression, leggings that'd fine. Can people apply compression
um Garb training still get positive effects yeah? not seen
evidence suggest block adaptation. may case. not aware
studies happens, certainly know information suggests can
hands little bit Muscle Recovery. ideally one knows workout
trigger lot soreness yeah compression gear sort
offset that, local muscle groups working
Reason asked socks understanding. socks uh, compression


socks people plane it’s going shift patterns blood flow, not just
lower legs, body yeah you're, probably going want focus
actual exercising tissue, though, Actually, that’s really good question. don't know
answer whether not upper body workout lower body compression
gear. actually help that’s great question. may done. don't know,
don't know answer general, just tell people like where, whole
thing much can um, actually not concerned wearing
workout. something put afterwards even wear just little bit
compression day. Um actually really fun study. Uh. collaborated
um Bill Kramer who's. Uh, know, Sports scientist Year award. bill Cramer
award, gives indication uh University Connecticut, well Lee
Brown, two Lifetime Achievement Award winners put people plane
stores, Connecticut flew Cal State Fullerton. cross-country flight
got wear compression gear flight others not,
landed California training bout put back plane, went back stores
think another training bout got back there. lot data
came paper, one things clear compression group
effective handling blood related coagulation issues associated
long flights particularly athletic performance. that’s actually sneaky little Insider trick
use lot people, particularly athletes traveling, just wear
compression gear plane. talked sort rung study
mind another effective strategy, compression gear general, well
particularly plane, basically tighter can get better, without obviously
making hands purple uncomfortable things like that, doesn't
overly tight. Anything will work probably help. also personally,
anytime, taking

01:08:27 Tool: Acute Soreness, Massage, Temperature

flight like much can just feel little better get there.
methods can use alleviate acute soreness? Well, continue
theme, saying okay, use sort pressure manipulation
enhance recovery. compression one strategy, can also use things like compression
boots garments, nomadic devices will know, pump uh air outside
compress back forth. number devices will this. can


also use physical hand, massage body work they're, really
working best. can tell mechanisms effectively moving fluid
tissue, well potentially enhancing blood flow, increasing capitalization
going get nutrients waste products out. can kind pick
choose based upon budget preferences availability timing, things like that,
effective strategies outside really next largest category, now
thermal uh, far discussion, mentioned cold water, Immersion
talked hypertrophy section not want immediately: post
exercise, getting cold water ice bath trying grow muscle
mass. said that, good evidence showing cold water immersion
specifically effective reducing muscle soreness. fair consideration it’s
classic example no free passes physiology. Nothing always good
always bad. It’s always willing give versus willing
get case like cold water immersion? may thinking yeah. might want
hypertrophic adaptations, phase training,
actually trying push towards optimization moment, rather long-term
adaptation, ice bath might great choice. addition, fall scenario
like Natasha - realize like just unbelievably sore - might cost three
four five six days training. might worth accelerate recovery
process couple days don't miss much training. it’s just it’s
algorithm, it’s equation. looking season trying compete
just done way way much exercise, really significant pain.
probably willing give small percentage eventual muscle growth
single session get pain cold strategies. Cold water immersion clearly
best approach rather cold air tactics. cold shower probably
not enough here. really want either moderately cold. maybe 40 50
degree, water probably north 15 minutes can sub 40 little maybe
five minutes get fact number studies um.
sort summarizing bunch kind one rather going Point
point. numbers just threw uh, assuming um uh Fahrenheit um,
seem seem really cold right uncomfortably cold. Absolutely always recommend
people ease protocol overall not immediately go 35 degree uh
cold water, never done uh. said, people comfortable
uncomfortable, always answer question: cold exactly?
agree very, cold much really really want get out,
able stay safely? Whatever value happens be, absolutely


need safe. said that, actually, xbt Retreats, put dozens, not
hundreds people point, uh immediately sub 35 degree water first time
ever done. know three minutes multiple rounds session, can handle it.
don't need go crazy. don't want kind play game right,
want really really cold short amount time, want like kind
cold longer amount time? really mistake can make
something like know, 65 degree water people not comfortable
know five ten minutes. It’s just not going be. It’s probably not going
effective. like man 35 is, absolutely crazy want 55 degree, water
literature area. it’s going say need probably
somewhere, almost really north 10 minutes, will actually show need
like well north 20 30 minutes. money rather go really really
cold get done five minutes, um personal preference one. can also
make little bit easier yourself. not nearly much evidence,
contrast. Stuff uh, go cold, hot sort back forth.
no really good rules terms much go, many rounds, long
cold long hot couple studies obviously
studies use numbers, doesn't mean tested See optimal,
big difference, can really just kind play feel hot good
Recovery. just careful going put blood flow
area, may walk additional acute swelling isn't going
put greater pressure there. kind play that. personally really like
hot Recovery. will feel - maybe not great moment, next day tend feel
really really good. addition, wake next morning really really hurting
super stiff, hot bath will help um quite bit, can play
protocols. Again, don't

01:14:21 Cold & Heat Contrast, Cold Shower vs. Immersion, Sauna & Fertility

nice absolutely no requirement so. just option interested
studies Dr Susanna soberg sure yeah not directly aimed alleviating soreness
recovery, increasing thermal capacity storage uh Brown adipose
tissue, not blubbery fat stuff around clavicles around heart help
generate body, heat rest metabolism on, numbers um
come not tested possible derivations just like


breathing. five minute sessions, knows? Maybe minute
equally effective. just constraints sorts studies, values
come with, seem good thresholds making sure
adaptation response triggered heat cold. ends 57 minutes per week,
total uncomfortable safe heat case sauna, can one session
breaking couple sessions day different days, 11
minutes per week. cold either one single session multiple sessions, one
um one break know multiple days one day
one. know hour sauna 11 minutes colder vice versa,
although seems little bit extreme, especially uninitiated.
numbers studied. point out, not lot really thorough
studies examining different cold protocols according temperature time requirements.
bit subjective, feel required establish routine, actually say
another time re-emphasize something. talked beginning
conversation, pain not defined outcome. It’s heavily influenced
perception, so, don't feel like work you, won't work. feel like
work fantastic, so. It’s challenging field get really objective data
always going little bit subjective nature. things, can tell
anecdotally: used hot cold contrast long time athletes. love
don't care everything between. it’s one things never
mandate it. course, can't mandate anything anyone work with, never
know like hey. interested great struggling area? want try this?
liked great struggling area, tried it. didn't love it.
Okay, fine, not find routes, will get lot ways enhance
recovery um. one hasn't even really come stopping problem
first place, not just treating symptoms, first line defense,
really need go back figure it’s happening begin with, Solution,
just different acute symptom management tactics. One final point uh,
deliberate, cold exposure. think worth mentioning one reasons shower
effective, not nearly effective cold water, immersion immersion ice
neck simply reason stated before, showers not
going get cold not going get know sub 40s. Also cold
showers haven't really studied much have, not nearly much
immersion people always ask just think challenges studying cold water
exposure shower, can't really control mango? much body
covered, whether not head stays different size bodies, Etc? Whereas


people come laboratory, can get cold large, know neck
is. know chin can make sure people's arms um legs
underneath, cold shower sure can make everyone face away toward
shower, it’s really tricky um variations described. said,
agree one wants use deliberate cold exposure, cold shower better
nothing cold immersion circulating, cold water ice bath better um
cold shower yeah? actually say looking recovery muscle soreness,
say cold shower, probably little, not going able
get enough cold water onto muscle, besides, basically head, maybe
try cold bath least get surface area coverage, yeah want
use cold shower awesome reasons cold shower. That’s totally great.
trying use recover low back glutes sore training
good way, it’s probably not going much immersion there.
actually also hit sneaky point, is, can't get water super cold, just
make water move. Jets stuff can turn anyone tried
like. Okay, can 40 degree. Bath awesome, try 60, water
moving right, break thermal layer. Normally little thin layer
water heating up. break up. It’s whole new world, yeah, absolutely
still cold. Water actually weaker way go correct can make
face stoic, make body circulate water around long
this. Maybe just one point heat uh: certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry,
sauna, steam saunas. Excuse me, jacuzzis can work pretty well yep um uh males.
looking conceive 60 days following uh uh following sauna um, hot tub realize
approaches severely limit number motile sperm um
substantially. people not trying conceive uh. Don'T think works
reliably enough, use form contraception yeah, people
trying conceive. really detrimental sperm Health right reason
people bring ice pack put groin near groin go
um, hard hot tub sauna. getting fine points,
um crude points, will pun intended, um, idea wouldn't want
anyone approach techniques compromise life goals, certainly not
allowed anywhere near things. uh, stage Life, just say
Natasha put x hanging Laird. reasons, like you're, not
going you're, not going none stuff, just wait right heat um heat


sperm relationship it’s not one that’s positive sperm


01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques

ways combine various types stimuli described inducing
recovery? talked breathing based tools which, adjust indeed
adjust oxygen carbon dioxide ratios Etc. guessing major effect
recovery going neural. It’s going deliberate, calm nervous system,
sympathetic, based uh, mentioned, yeah definitely, talked
movement based touch-based approaches. Um, will uh movement
circulate, certainly will circulate blood, also will generate contractions muscles yep
right, maybe, if, indeed again, still speculates you, indeed soreness
due excessive stretch swelling stretch, ends muscles
make sense movement touch thermal, ways combine
um effective maybe even synergistic yeah. suppose throw uh
compression garments put Pneumatic compression device sit sauna.
regulate breath like fine. Quite honestly, though,
probably don't need maximize them. joking. probably go
light swim regulating breathing cold water. get compression
cold, water good spot, certainly that. reality
is. generally look physical approach holistic approach breath
work. Basically, want breath something else knock two things
good spot, breath thermal stress, just
controlling unregulation stuff. also remember ice stressor
actually show data second actually can enhance
systemic recovery, although won't happen acute minutes. fact, it’s going
take least 30 60 minutes eventually see rebound effect, acutely it’s
going make actually sympathetic, going direction. can
opposite can actually drive up. it’s little bit dependent upon
respond, time day you're, using general, guess combining
need um, depending available. perhaps don't
sauna, can take hot bath great. Maybe percussion device
tool can use that. don't sauna amazing. don't ice bath


things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food

basically assume totally physiologically irrelevant, order
important, totally depends market looking at, markers
might need see four five six hundred fold increase before. know will actually
enough call physiologically relevant others one two percent
relevant, really want careful either reading papers
looking Social Media stuff. people just talking this, marker increase much,
may not matter, may totally irrelevant physiologically,
also, wondering like hell are, people. Well, that’s can
trick little bit intentionally not. just trying best,
don't really understand area enough, that’s important point pay attention to.
So. answer question fully, hard determine truly
maximum level um. things don't want move like blood pH. doesn't really want
move range going move from, know like 6.8 7.4, get
like 7.9, like you're, probably big big big trouble, things can go 500 5 000
fold, markers will really determine answer well point future.
love continue discussion around topic stress, specifically yeah um,
maybe will get little bit later today um get use deliberate
cold exposure, that’s certainly um effects related directly temperature
tissue. certainly mental effects terms raising one's level perceived pain. It’s
fun um, people love people love feeling get it.
Um deliberate cold exposure. people like feeling get not
unlike exercise totally. love train. love exercise, know many people uh um.
loathe exercise, love feeling afterward. will theme will
come back to. Thank indulging interest

00:40:36 4 Recovery Levels, Enhance Recovery

semi-tangent, think it’s relevant tangent thing, can now return
us different time, scales, yeah modes recovery, think
headed get better recovery. Yep. talk tools, talk
measure identify four distinct levels, level one call
overload just quickly means is. workout today. sign
symptom overload fatigued. Acute performance down, worked hard right
now. go, try maximum effort, reduced ability.
recovery period acute overload minutes days right. That’s generally, call


acute overload that’s looking right. systems theoretically
see hormetic stressor come back response, come back, bigger, better, efficient,
Etc. continue training state, like us, say workout
today, little bit acute overload going work tomorrow. little acute
overload can work next day little acute overload. Even took day
it’s doesn't matter right, just continue acute bouts insult
going pushing absolute golden Target, call functional
overreaching. reached can currently results
functional outcome, mean functionally performance enhanced
performance whatever deem stronger, you've, enhanced
muscle size, mitochondria improved you've, whatever thing is, it’s not just
physical performance thing right, amazing, recovery time functional overreaching
typically days maybe even week so, typically, see happen
prior competition. Individuals will call taper, reduced training
volume short period time, reason do. again.
Actualize phrase year adaptations, worked hard six
weeks know, theoretically, workouts. three four five six weeks ago,
allow, system recover will actualized, means performance will
enhanced. functional overreaching golden Target. Okay,
point functional overreaching - continue train intensified whether
intensity volume really. said earlier, something
holding back recovery. doesn't really matter right. It’s it’s sort two sides
coin. move call non-functional overreaching
reached again, now non-functional not see positive benefit
recovery allowed. typically means weeks takes weeks come back from,
basically just get back Baseline, lot folks end
vicious cycle, like man, not getting results. want. going train
harder, not getting results. want going train harder harder,
caught recovery isn't improved, just end spot. train
end spot end up. just either blowing quitting
not getting want. continue past point, may
actually actually call training typically, considered
trained takes months recover people think trained really
not you're. Just probably non-functionally overreached classic distinction is,
took three four days off felt better, weren't, probably quote unquote
trained. probably just area non-functional reaching. need little bit


back off - case. happen gymnasts
cheerleader things take month off barely seeing
start come back Baseline numbers. number areas, mood desire
train testosterone, cortisol ratios biomarkers number areas - physical performance,
vertical jump height, like things just start get back Baseline, true
training actually quite rare. Non-Functional overreaching much common
shorter time frame scale. talk recovery, four pieces
really thinking about, so, concerned about, oh super sore.
get less sore? either not sore next time? workout
super sorry. Now. recover playing first category overload
can certainly talk figure out. quick answer got go back
previous episodes just pay attention volume intensity recommendations
getting significantly uh damage fatigue workout? probably
increased volume quickly, something else dragging stress bucket down,
generally, problem training. Um either didn't warm sufficiently.
fueling strategy off talk Next Episode violated. One
principles increasing intensity volume sort quickly, it’s past
getting stage you're, just like feeling beat time energy going
down, just not feeling like recovered. Now overreaching stage,
story kind tell always years ago working wife Natasha
garage training something like comes stumbling
look Eyes like eyeballs, giant she's, just like wobbling she's.
Like effed up, like mean like effed she's? Just like, read
program wrong like Trump like what'd. like supposed
10 sets three every minute minute three sets ten every minute
minute absolutely wrecked. couldn't move hours afterwards
days, she's. Just like handle kids like, can't get bed.
can't move like classic example right like don't need fix recovery
here, you're, just dummy, dream way hard long like not
don't problem here. it’s situation like that, it’s generally just program
way off. it’s constantly happening you're, just like man like whatever reason,
every while, getting really sore really bad performance
workouts, need go stress bucket. Take look allostatic load
allostasis get figured happening um.




00:48:19 Overreaching vs. Overtraining

happy pointed distinction functional overreaching, training
trained. think one one common mistake people make thinking
biology generally think terms nouns adjectives not verbs amazing.
love much know, biology collection processes processes depending
live, trained trained state that,
many ways, adjective trained trained. It’s like saying, uh,
know American, know Czechoslovakian whatever happens, right
many ways people start associate identity, least transient identity,
start making sorts decisions. sounds like sorts verbs will
will not engage in, whereas think look things processes assign verbs
them, can say: okay, functionally overreaching truly training,
matter Degrees, correct right training matter, not reaching,
not functionally reaching it’s just it’s just performance, know, just
nervous system, won't change unless give reason reason why,
can Perform something perfectly speak language perfectly. no rewiring
nervous system. myth told every experience rewires
nervous system, it’s different now two seconds ago. That’s that’s ridiculous,
illogical statement. know. That’s not true nervous system can perform something,
no reason change won't muscles way.
progressively overload learn something new challenge muscle
something new, it’s thing. example gave uh wife
workout turned far strenuous, functionally overreach.
sense, might training heading direction training,
mistake assume trained right, kind it’s almost becomes
bit state character assignment um, opposed verb, case,
no perfect way describe - talking nouns adjectives also
um talking verbs. think verbs really anchored processes
things actions can take um. may, like just highlight this,
idea shifting one sinking towards verb actions rather labels state
happen person happen right. Sometimes even become
kind character. Logical way people describe uh, believe
something called training training real words,
don't ever really know trained, nailed it. there's. No, know it’s
not like red flag. Uh, know shoots shoulder say trained.


know it’s um, so, hope can start thinking verbs,
actions can take order ensure stimulate Progressive, overload
one way another time, don't fall bins character
assignment suddenly decide need X like take month off
something like that, beginning realize um discussion that’s
exactly wrong way go. fantastic points want make sure clear
no clinical diagnosis training. no standards, no test
blood panel. can pull. actually identify state.
distinction Here, Andrew verbs, rather nouns is, wonderful
exactly case. way really come retroactively, diagnose
one training is, had. weeks recovery got back
Baseline, can't moment. can't take single test, no subjective
marker anything says trained. simply, probably training,
need reverse quickly case step probably non-
functionally overreaching. continue this, will probably enter new stage
training need come back. that’s important thing
let people know no one thing actually point says

00:52:53 Tool: Acute Overload & Recovery, Breathwork

not noun, verb. tools can use
enhance recovery yep? start off acute overload phase. So, words,
just workout feeling awful just one two days ago super sore.
get rid right now? Well, couple things can immediately
workout others maybe actionable day later two days
later just cover handful them. nutrition hydration
supplementation next episode. going cover everything else, not category
right now, couple things number one. can actually start Kickstart recovery
process end current training session, guess say way.
strongly suggest start recovery process immediately workout
mentioned earlier idea got get really high peak stress cause
adaptation, actually didn't explain correctly, happen
need extremely High peak, met extremely sharp
recovery back down, know talked
neuroplasticity stuff terms happen caused insult.


immediately need able recover make sure causes changes brains
thing happens here. need really sharp high inflammatory response
then, not meet immediate recovery period, signal won't
maximize results. mean can actually couple things? Number
one actually listening slow, paced, music evidence suggest fast-paced music
may slow recovery slow pace actually enhance it. just change
know maximum get get going music workout
slower, lower Cadence will help kick start idea similar note. can also
use call regulation breathing. conjunction one
other, whichever you, personal favorite method somewhere
three ten minutes finishing training session. Laying like
position, certainly Lotus position, think laying back
generally effective personal preference there, no science, like items
covered getting dark quiet sort area Then, just breathing nose
structured, Cadence, lot different things. can try easy example. just
box breathing can imagine box four squares. going
inhale somewhere between, like three eight seconds whatever number
choose, keep tempo, say chose five second inhale,
that’s going take vertically horizontally box five second hold
five second exhale five second hold, just need repeat
time domain. Now typically honestly don't use timer you'll, actually notice. lot
people will like fall asleep get really close falling asleep period. can
triangle version that, inhale, hold exhale go right back
inhale bunch different tricks. can try here, need play around
see actually works best you. Um 10 minutes probably better, can just
least give three that'll work, really really resistant, can actually that. Just
shower, going finish workout get shower again, just close
eyes shower, give three minutes focused relaxation breathing will
accelerate recovery process. love particularly love laboratory
works stress respiration, okay, breathing interactions two
just mention result just accepted publication, time day.
uh. Thank you. Uh beautiful work uh, not directly, although took
place lab, know, it’s students doctors um, Dr Melise uh, balbon
uh lab. It’s phenomenal researcher showed short period five minutes
box breathing exactly type described cyclic sign two inhales, followed
extended exhale lungs empty. Ideally, inhales done nose.


exhales done. Uh mouth, although done nose, um
mouth matter, probably nose. Nose inhale, inhale mouth exhale
um uh inhales, nose exhale nose. Cyclic sighing,
refer done five minutes, produce significant decreases resting
heart rate. time will increase things like heart rate, variability
forth. Um provided extended exhales. seems like calming response,
reduction overall stress occurs. thing really sends things
direction something like cyclic hyperventilation. sure observed um
interestingly uh, people just five minutes meditation which,
which, course, breathing just allowing breathing progress.
However, happens moment, um moments across five minutes uh.
reductions sorts markers stress described not significant
breathing. love Brock's breathing tool, post, workout, um
Alternatives too, just mentioned, think people greatly underestimate
potency breathing shifting one's nervous system function away stress one
wants toward alertness stress. actually couple questions
sure. think audience appreciate uh. long boxes? just
user selected great question, use carbon dioxide tolerance test amazing order
people determine long different sides Box be, cover
carbon dioxide tolerance tests. previous episode, can provide link clip um
show, note captions, but, point out, involves long extended exhale lungs,
empty um and, course, people sit lungs empty, accurately
Faithfully say report long took empty lungs. use
gauge. Typically, takes, people go lungs empty 20 seconds less, believe
go back paper look, believe duration sides
boxes were, somewhere um two three seconds,
CO2 discard time anywhere uh 20 seconds 40 45 seconds, use it.
sides box, believe, four six seconds people
longer discard Arrow period minute more. used
box duration inhale, hold exhale, hold duration somewhere between. believe
[ Music, ], um, seven, maybe eight long 11 12 seconds yeah.
will get kind free diver types. can really this? really well
trained sort thing? don't quote exactly numbers,
approximate. line exactly done. believe it’s it’s going
close within seconds non-important Distinction. it’s going close enough,
that’s great, uh. took six weeks. study done


period month swapped new pattern breathing um,
condition meditation condition - done natural world, say, um
wearing whoop bands. getting heart rate, heart rate, variability, sleep,
data, subjective data mood Etc. lot measures, um
100 subjects wild life um tried best track life, stress
events exercise, things like harder control outside laboratory.
Really results speak exactly exactly describing here,
deliberate respiration involves controlled holds exhales really dramatic
immediate impact reducing levels stress. That’s wonderful! not surprised
findings really interesting that, mentioned
exhalation portion primarily responsible regulation that’s actually goes
back previous endurance conversation, general rest, non-altitude
increases Co2 primary driver ventilation, generally means
inhales associated uptick sympathetic State exhales associated
uptick parasympathetic State. generally, folks will things like exhale
finish exhale right perform high Precision, neurological tasks.
going say, aim Target shoot going Exhale fully almost
always execute movement end exhale, that’s
highest parasympathetic State lowest drive ventilation. say not surprised
guys found actually data point individuals, particularly
endurance. Training can get back Baseline heart rate going
correlated with. gets actual results training. Said take
bunch individuals put endurance training program,
measure quickly can get back Baseline workout general,
folks better going see greater improvements Performance
end say, four six eight week, training block little bit
causation correlation untie. think it’s enough say: hey
invest three case study five minutes. It’s going
enhance recovery, likelihood increasing results training, now
also additional benefits like able transition appropriately next
task, going work going see family whatever thing is, it’s it’s nice close to,
asked high, sympathetic State body, asked perform
stress. gave recovery now ready transition next thing
don't take exercise energy. will next

01:03:39 Tool: Alleviate Acute Soreness, Compression Clothing



task may may not want sympathetic Drive state. somebody sore
following workout, either locally sore muscle, group group muscles, maybe
legs chest torso maybe whole body sore sometimes case.
tools can Implement order accelerate the? want call
moving soreness, it’s really, know, alleviation soreness
bunch different processes. effective tools push back
soreness dissipate yeah? Absolutely. First all, it’s not lactate! That’s just really
important thing still hear people talk about. know sore 24 hours later
got thing get lactate there, talked metabolism,
uh conversation episode not cause fatigue it’s certainly not
cause soreness. not actionable tip there, just pet peeve mine. hear
people say get irritated can maybe end conversation um strategies,
tools, can do, can actually wear compression gear will help little
bit. decent amount evidence, suggesting, just you, know, put
tighter fitting clothes Leisure, wear compression gear. can
actually prevent little bit soreness occurring. case poor
Natasha - realize just done way way much went hung
bow hunting friend trained way hard, realize, oh, goodness,
going sore here. can immediately put compression gear weigh
really long possible. examples compression gear? seen
people plane high high socks um, mean anything wear
compression gear exercise. whether just know,
compression pants leggings tight fitting leggings uh, whether long sleeve
shirt, that’s like rash guard, wear know Jiu, Jitsu surfing, something
like that. long it’s tight fitting, doesn't much can wear.
suppose get socks, great, generally just tell leads them.
put long sleeve compression shirts wear training
long, compression, leggings that'd fine. Can people apply compression
um Garb training still get positive effects yeah? not seen
evidence suggest block adaptation. may case. not aware
studies happens, certainly know information suggests can
hands little bit Muscle Recovery. ideally one knows workout
trigger lot soreness yeah compression gear sort
offset that, local muscle groups working
Reason asked socks understanding. socks uh, compression


socks people plane it’s going shift patterns blood flow, not just
lower legs, body yeah you're, probably going want focus
actual exercising tissue, though, Actually, that’s really good question. don't know
answer whether not upper body workout lower body compression
gear. actually help that’s great question. may done. don't know,
don't know answer general, just tell people like where, whole
thing much can um, actually not concerned wearing
workout. something put afterwards even wear just little bit
compression day. Um actually really fun study. Uh. collaborated
um Bill Kramer who's. Uh, know, Sports scientist Year award. bill Cramer
award, gives indication uh University Connecticut, well Lee
Brown, two Lifetime Achievement Award winners put people plane
stores, Connecticut flew Cal State Fullerton. cross-country flight
got wear compression gear flight others not,
landed California training bout put back plane, went back stores
think another training bout got back there. lot data
came paper, one things clear compression group
effective handling blood related coagulation issues associated
long flights particularly athletic performance. that’s actually sneaky little Insider trick
use lot people, particularly athletes traveling, just wear
compression gear plane. talked sort rung study
mind another effective strategy, compression gear general, well
particularly plane, basically tighter can get better, without obviously
making hands purple uncomfortable things like that, doesn't
overly tight. Anything will work probably help. also personally,
anytime, taking

01:08:27 Tool: Acute Soreness, Massage, Temperature

flight like much can just feel little better get there.
methods can use alleviate acute soreness? Well, continue
theme, saying okay, use sort pressure manipulation
enhance recovery. compression one strategy, can also use things like compression
boots garments, nomadic devices will know, pump uh air outside
compress back forth. number devices will this. can


also use physical hand, massage body work they're, really
working best. can tell mechanisms effectively moving fluid
tissue, well potentially enhancing blood flow, increasing capitalization
going get nutrients waste products out. can kind pick
choose based upon budget preferences availability timing, things like that,
effective strategies outside really next largest category, now
thermal uh, far discussion, mentioned cold water, Immersion
talked hypertrophy section not want immediately: post
exercise, getting cold water ice bath trying grow muscle
mass. said that, good evidence showing cold water immersion
specifically effective reducing muscle soreness. fair consideration it’s
classic example no free passes physiology. Nothing always good
always bad. It’s always willing give versus willing
get case like cold water immersion? may thinking yeah. might want
hypertrophic adaptations, phase training,
actually trying push towards optimization moment, rather long-term
adaptation, ice bath might great choice. addition, fall scenario
like Natasha - realize like just unbelievably sore - might cost three
four five six days training. might worth accelerate recovery
process couple days don't miss much training. it’s just it’s
algorithm, it’s equation. looking season trying compete
just done way way much exercise, really significant pain.
probably willing give small percentage eventual muscle growth
single session get pain cold strategies. Cold water immersion clearly
best approach rather cold air tactics. cold shower probably
not enough here. really want either moderately cold. maybe 40 50
degree, water probably north 15 minutes can sub 40 little maybe
five minutes get fact number studies um.
sort summarizing bunch kind one rather going Point
point. numbers just threw uh, assuming um uh Fahrenheit um,
seem seem really cold right uncomfortably cold. Absolutely always recommend
people ease protocol overall not immediately go 35 degree uh
cold water, never done uh. said, people comfortable
uncomfortable, always answer question: cold exactly?
agree very, cold much really really want get out,
able stay safely? Whatever value happens be, absolutely


need safe. said that, actually, xbt Retreats, put dozens, not
hundreds people point, uh immediately sub 35 degree water first time
ever done. know three minutes multiple rounds session, can handle it.
don't need go crazy. don't want kind play game right,
want really really cold short amount time, want like kind
cold longer amount time? really mistake can make
something like know, 65 degree water people not comfortable
know five ten minutes. It’s just not going be. It’s probably not going
effective. like man 35 is, absolutely crazy want 55 degree, water
literature area. it’s going say need probably
somewhere, almost really north 10 minutes, will actually show need
like well north 20 30 minutes. money rather go really really
cold get done five minutes, um personal preference one. can also
make little bit easier yourself. not nearly much evidence,
contrast. Stuff uh, go cold, hot sort back forth.
no really good rules terms much go, many rounds, long
cold long hot couple studies obviously
studies use numbers, doesn't mean tested See optimal,
big difference, can really just kind play feel hot good
Recovery. just careful going put blood flow
area, may walk additional acute swelling isn't going
put greater pressure there. kind play that. personally really like
hot Recovery. will feel - maybe not great moment, next day tend feel
really really good. addition, wake next morning really really hurting
super stiff, hot bath will help um quite bit, can play
protocols. Again, don't

01:14:21 Cold & Heat Contrast, Cold Shower vs. Immersion, Sauna & Fertility

nice absolutely no requirement so. just option interested
studies Dr Susanna soberg sure yeah not directly aimed alleviating soreness
recovery, increasing thermal capacity storage uh Brown adipose
tissue, not blubbery fat stuff around clavicles around heart help
generate body, heat rest metabolism on, numbers um
come not tested possible derivations just like


breathing. five minute sessions, knows? Maybe minute
equally effective. just constraints sorts studies, values
come with, seem good thresholds making sure
adaptation response triggered heat cold. ends 57 minutes per week,
total uncomfortable safe heat case sauna, can one session
breaking couple sessions day different days, 11
minutes per week. cold either one single session multiple sessions, one
um one break know multiple days one day
one. know hour sauna 11 minutes colder vice versa,
although seems little bit extreme, especially uninitiated.
numbers studied. point out, not lot really thorough
studies examining different cold protocols according temperature time requirements.
bit subjective, feel required establish routine, actually say
another time re-emphasize something. talked beginning
conversation, pain not defined outcome. It’s heavily influenced
perception, so, don't feel like work you, won't work. feel like
work fantastic, so. It’s challenging field get really objective data
always going little bit subjective nature. things, can tell
anecdotally: used hot cold contrast long time athletes. love
don't care everything between. it’s one things never
mandate it. course, can't mandate anything anyone work with, never
know like hey. interested great struggling area? want try this?
liked great struggling area, tried it. didn't love it.
Okay, fine, not find routes, will get lot ways enhance
recovery um. one hasn't even really come stopping problem
first place, not just treating symptoms, first line defense,
really need go back figure it’s happening begin with, Solution,
just different acute symptom management tactics. One final point uh,
deliberate, cold exposure. think worth mentioning one reasons shower
effective, not nearly effective cold water, immersion immersion ice
neck simply reason stated before, showers not
going get cold not going get know sub 40s. Also cold
showers haven't really studied much have, not nearly much
immersion people always ask just think challenges studying cold water
exposure shower, can't really control mango? much body
covered, whether not head stays different size bodies, Etc? Whereas


people come laboratory, can get cold large, know neck
is. know chin can make sure people's arms um legs
underneath, cold shower sure can make everyone face away toward
shower, it’s really tricky um variations described. said,
agree one wants use deliberate cold exposure, cold shower better
nothing cold immersion circulating, cold water ice bath better um
cold shower yeah? actually say looking recovery muscle soreness,
say cold shower, probably little, not going able
get enough cold water onto muscle, besides, basically head, maybe
try cold bath least get surface area coverage, yeah want
use cold shower awesome reasons cold shower. That’s totally great.
trying use recover low back glutes sore training
good way, it’s probably not going much immersion there.
actually also hit sneaky point, is, can't get water super cold, just
make water move. Jets stuff can turn anyone tried
like. Okay, can 40 degree. Bath awesome, try 60, water
moving right, break thermal layer. Normally little thin layer
water heating up. break up. It’s whole new world, yeah, absolutely
still cold. Water actually weaker way go correct can make
face stoic, make body circulate water around long
this. Maybe just one point heat uh: certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry,
sauna, steam saunas. Excuse me, jacuzzis can work pretty well yep um uh males.
looking conceive 60 days following uh uh following sauna um, hot tub realize
approaches severely limit number motile sperm um
substantially. people not trying conceive uh. Don'T think works
reliably enough, use form contraception yeah, people
trying conceive. really detrimental sperm Health right reason
people bring ice pack put groin near groin go
um, hard hot tub sauna. getting fine points,
um crude points, will pun intended, um, idea wouldn't want
anyone approach techniques compromise life goals, certainly not
allowed anywhere near things. uh, stage Life, just say
Natasha put x hanging Laird. reasons, like you're, not
going you're, not going none stuff, just wait right heat um heat


sperm relationship it’s not one that’s positive sperm


01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques

ways combine various types stimuli described inducing
recovery? talked breathing based tools which, adjust indeed
adjust oxygen carbon dioxide ratios Etc. guessing major effect
recovery going neural. It’s going deliberate, calm nervous system,
sympathetic, based uh, mentioned, yeah definitely, talked
movement based touch-based approaches. Um, will uh movement
circulate, certainly will circulate blood, also will generate contractions muscles yep
right, maybe, if, indeed again, still speculates you, indeed soreness
due excessive stretch swelling stretch, ends muscles
make sense movement touch thermal, ways combine
um effective maybe even synergistic yeah. suppose throw uh
compression garments put Pneumatic compression device sit sauna.
regulate breath like fine. Quite honestly, though,
probably don't need maximize them. joking. probably go
light swim regulating breathing cold water. get compression
cold, water good spot, certainly that. reality
is. generally look physical approach holistic approach breath
work. Basically, want breath something else knock two things
good spot, breath thermal stress, just
controlling unregulation stuff. also remember ice stressor
actually show data second actually can enhance
systemic recovery, although won't happen acute minutes. fact, it’s going
take least 30 60 minutes eventually see rebound effect, acutely it’s
going make actually sympathetic, going direction. can
opposite can actually drive up. it’s little bit dependent upon
respond, time day you're, using general, guess combining
need um, depending available. perhaps don't
sauna, can take hot bath great. Maybe percussion device
tool can use that. don't sauna amazing. don't ice bath


things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

acute overload that’s looking right. systems theoretically
see hormetic stressor come back response, come back, bigger, better, efficient,
Etc. continue training state, like us, say workout
today, little bit acute overload going work tomorrow. little acute
overload can work next day little acute overload. Even took day
it’s doesn't matter right, just continue acute bouts insult
going pushing absolute golden Target, call functional
overreaching. reached can currently results
functional outcome, mean functionally performance enhanced
performance whatever deem stronger, you've, enhanced
muscle size, mitochondria improved you've, whatever thing is, it’s not just
physical performance thing right, amazing, recovery time functional overreaching
typically days maybe even week so, typically, see happen
prior competition. Individuals will call taper, reduced training
volume short period time, reason do. again.
Actualize phrase year adaptations, worked hard six
weeks know, theoretically, workouts. three four five six weeks ago,
allow, system recover will actualized, means performance will
enhanced. functional overreaching golden Target. Okay,
point functional overreaching - continue train intensified whether
intensity volume really. said earlier, something
holding back recovery. doesn't really matter right. It’s it’s sort two sides
coin. move call non-functional overreaching
reached again, now non-functional not see positive benefit
recovery allowed. typically means weeks takes weeks come back from,
basically just get back Baseline, lot folks end
vicious cycle, like man, not getting results. want. going train
harder, not getting results. want going train harder harder,
caught recovery isn't improved, just end spot. train
end spot end up. just either blowing quitting
not getting want. continue past point, may
actually actually call training typically, considered
trained takes months recover people think trained really
not you're. Just probably non-functionally overreached classic distinction is,
took three four days off felt better, weren't, probably quote unquote
trained. probably just area non-functional reaching. need little bit


back off - case. happen gymnasts
cheerleader things take month off barely seeing
start come back Baseline numbers. number areas, mood desire
train testosterone, cortisol ratios biomarkers number areas - physical performance,
vertical jump height, like things just start get back Baseline, true
training actually quite rare. Non-Functional overreaching much common
shorter time frame scale. talk recovery, four pieces
really thinking about, so, concerned about, oh super sore.
get less sore? either not sore next time? workout
super sorry. Now. recover playing first category overload
can certainly talk figure out. quick answer got go back
previous episodes just pay attention volume intensity recommendations
getting significantly uh damage fatigue workout? probably
increased volume quickly, something else dragging stress bucket down,
generally, problem training. Um either didn't warm sufficiently.
fueling strategy off talk Next Episode violated. One
principles increasing intensity volume sort quickly, it’s past
getting stage you're, just like feeling beat time energy going
down, just not feeling like recovered. Now overreaching stage,
story kind tell always years ago working wife Natasha
garage training something like comes stumbling
look Eyes like eyeballs, giant she's, just like wobbling she's.
Like effed up, like mean like effed she's? Just like, read
program wrong like Trump like what'd. like supposed
10 sets three every minute minute three sets ten every minute
minute absolutely wrecked. couldn't move hours afterwards
days, she's. Just like handle kids like, can't get bed.
can't move like classic example right like don't need fix recovery
here, you're, just dummy, dream way hard long like not
don't problem here. it’s situation like that, it’s generally just program
way off. it’s constantly happening you're, just like man like whatever reason,
every while, getting really sore really bad performance
workouts, need go stress bucket. Take look allostatic load
allostasis get figured happening um.




00:48:19 Overreaching vs. Overtraining

happy pointed distinction functional overreaching, training
trained. think one one common mistake people make thinking
biology generally think terms nouns adjectives not verbs amazing.
love much know, biology collection processes processes depending
live, trained trained state that,
many ways, adjective trained trained. It’s like saying, uh,
know American, know Czechoslovakian whatever happens, right
many ways people start associate identity, least transient identity,
start making sorts decisions. sounds like sorts verbs will
will not engage in, whereas think look things processes assign verbs
them, can say: okay, functionally overreaching truly training,
matter Degrees, correct right training matter, not reaching,
not functionally reaching it’s just it’s just performance, know, just
nervous system, won't change unless give reason reason why,
can Perform something perfectly speak language perfectly. no rewiring
nervous system. myth told every experience rewires
nervous system, it’s different now two seconds ago. That’s that’s ridiculous,
illogical statement. know. That’s not true nervous system can perform something,
no reason change won't muscles way.
progressively overload learn something new challenge muscle
something new, it’s thing. example gave uh wife
workout turned far strenuous, functionally overreach.
sense, might training heading direction training,
mistake assume trained right, kind it’s almost becomes
bit state character assignment um, opposed verb, case,
no perfect way describe - talking nouns adjectives also
um talking verbs. think verbs really anchored processes
things actions can take um. may, like just highlight this,
idea shifting one sinking towards verb actions rather labels state
happen person happen right. Sometimes even become
kind character. Logical way people describe uh, believe
something called training training real words,
don't ever really know trained, nailed it. there's. No, know it’s
not like red flag. Uh, know shoots shoulder say trained.


know it’s um, so, hope can start thinking verbs,
actions can take order ensure stimulate Progressive, overload
one way another time, don't fall bins character
assignment suddenly decide need X like take month off
something like that, beginning realize um discussion that’s
exactly wrong way go. fantastic points want make sure clear
no clinical diagnosis training. no standards, no test
blood panel. can pull. actually identify state.
distinction Here, Andrew verbs, rather nouns is, wonderful
exactly case. way really come retroactively, diagnose
one training is, had. weeks recovery got back
Baseline, can't moment. can't take single test, no subjective
marker anything says trained. simply, probably training,
need reverse quickly case step probably non-
functionally overreaching. continue this, will probably enter new stage
training need come back. that’s important thing
let people know no one thing actually point says

00:52:53 Tool: Acute Overload & Recovery, Breathwork

not noun, verb. tools can use
enhance recovery yep? start off acute overload phase. So, words,
just workout feeling awful just one two days ago super sore.
get rid right now? Well, couple things can immediately
workout others maybe actionable day later two days
later just cover handful them. nutrition hydration
supplementation next episode. going cover everything else, not category
right now, couple things number one. can actually start Kickstart recovery
process end current training session, guess say way.
strongly suggest start recovery process immediately workout
mentioned earlier idea got get really high peak stress cause
adaptation, actually didn't explain correctly, happen
need extremely High peak, met extremely sharp
recovery back down, know talked
neuroplasticity stuff terms happen caused insult.


immediately need able recover make sure causes changes brains
thing happens here. need really sharp high inflammatory response
then, not meet immediate recovery period, signal won't
maximize results. mean can actually couple things? Number
one actually listening slow, paced, music evidence suggest fast-paced music
may slow recovery slow pace actually enhance it. just change
know maximum get get going music workout
slower, lower Cadence will help kick start idea similar note. can also
use call regulation breathing. conjunction one
other, whichever you, personal favorite method somewhere
three ten minutes finishing training session. Laying like
position, certainly Lotus position, think laying back
generally effective personal preference there, no science, like items
covered getting dark quiet sort area Then, just breathing nose
structured, Cadence, lot different things. can try easy example. just
box breathing can imagine box four squares. going
inhale somewhere between, like three eight seconds whatever number
choose, keep tempo, say chose five second inhale,
that’s going take vertically horizontally box five second hold
five second exhale five second hold, just need repeat
time domain. Now typically honestly don't use timer you'll, actually notice. lot
people will like fall asleep get really close falling asleep period. can
triangle version that, inhale, hold exhale go right back
inhale bunch different tricks. can try here, need play around
see actually works best you. Um 10 minutes probably better, can just
least give three that'll work, really really resistant, can actually that. Just
shower, going finish workout get shower again, just close
eyes shower, give three minutes focused relaxation breathing will
accelerate recovery process. love particularly love laboratory
works stress respiration, okay, breathing interactions two
just mention result just accepted publication, time day.
uh. Thank you. Uh beautiful work uh, not directly, although took
place lab, know, it’s students doctors um, Dr Melise uh, balbon
uh lab. It’s phenomenal researcher showed short period five minutes
box breathing exactly type described cyclic sign two inhales, followed
extended exhale lungs empty. Ideally, inhales done nose.


exhales done. Uh mouth, although done nose, um
mouth matter, probably nose. Nose inhale, inhale mouth exhale
um uh inhales, nose exhale nose. Cyclic sighing,
refer done five minutes, produce significant decreases resting
heart rate. time will increase things like heart rate, variability
forth. Um provided extended exhales. seems like calming response,
reduction overall stress occurs. thing really sends things
direction something like cyclic hyperventilation. sure observed um
interestingly uh, people just five minutes meditation which,
which, course, breathing just allowing breathing progress.
However, happens moment, um moments across five minutes uh.
reductions sorts markers stress described not significant
breathing. love Brock's breathing tool, post, workout, um
Alternatives too, just mentioned, think people greatly underestimate
potency breathing shifting one's nervous system function away stress one
wants toward alertness stress. actually couple questions
sure. think audience appreciate uh. long boxes? just
user selected great question, use carbon dioxide tolerance test amazing order
people determine long different sides Box be, cover
carbon dioxide tolerance tests. previous episode, can provide link clip um
show, note captions, but, point out, involves long extended exhale lungs,
empty um and, course, people sit lungs empty, accurately
Faithfully say report long took empty lungs. use
gauge. Typically, takes, people go lungs empty 20 seconds less, believe
go back paper look, believe duration sides
boxes were, somewhere um two three seconds,
CO2 discard time anywhere uh 20 seconds 40 45 seconds, use it.
sides box, believe, four six seconds people
longer discard Arrow period minute more. used
box duration inhale, hold exhale, hold duration somewhere between. believe
[ Music, ], um, seven, maybe eight long 11 12 seconds yeah.
will get kind free diver types. can really this? really well
trained sort thing? don't quote exactly numbers,
approximate. line exactly done. believe it’s it’s going
close within seconds non-important Distinction. it’s going close enough,
that’s great, uh. took six weeks. study done


period month swapped new pattern breathing um,
condition meditation condition - done natural world, say, um
wearing whoop bands. getting heart rate, heart rate, variability, sleep,
data, subjective data mood Etc. lot measures, um
100 subjects wild life um tried best track life, stress
events exercise, things like harder control outside laboratory.
Really results speak exactly exactly describing here,
deliberate respiration involves controlled holds exhales really dramatic
immediate impact reducing levels stress. That’s wonderful! not surprised
findings really interesting that, mentioned
exhalation portion primarily responsible regulation that’s actually goes
back previous endurance conversation, general rest, non-altitude
increases Co2 primary driver ventilation, generally means
inhales associated uptick sympathetic State exhales associated
uptick parasympathetic State. generally, folks will things like exhale
finish exhale right perform high Precision, neurological tasks.
going say, aim Target shoot going Exhale fully almost
always execute movement end exhale, that’s
highest parasympathetic State lowest drive ventilation. say not surprised
guys found actually data point individuals, particularly
endurance. Training can get back Baseline heart rate going
correlated with. gets actual results training. Said take
bunch individuals put endurance training program,
measure quickly can get back Baseline workout general,
folks better going see greater improvements Performance
end say, four six eight week, training block little bit
causation correlation untie. think it’s enough say: hey
invest three case study five minutes. It’s going
enhance recovery, likelihood increasing results training, now
also additional benefits like able transition appropriately next
task, going work going see family whatever thing is, it’s it’s nice close to,
asked high, sympathetic State body, asked perform
stress. gave recovery now ready transition next thing
don't take exercise energy. will next

01:03:39 Tool: Alleviate Acute Soreness, Compression Clothing



task may may not want sympathetic Drive state. somebody sore
following workout, either locally sore muscle, group group muscles, maybe
legs chest torso maybe whole body sore sometimes case.
tools can Implement order accelerate the? want call
moving soreness, it’s really, know, alleviation soreness
bunch different processes. effective tools push back
soreness dissipate yeah? Absolutely. First all, it’s not lactate! That’s just really
important thing still hear people talk about. know sore 24 hours later
got thing get lactate there, talked metabolism,
uh conversation episode not cause fatigue it’s certainly not
cause soreness. not actionable tip there, just pet peeve mine. hear
people say get irritated can maybe end conversation um strategies,
tools, can do, can actually wear compression gear will help little
bit. decent amount evidence, suggesting, just you, know, put
tighter fitting clothes Leisure, wear compression gear. can
actually prevent little bit soreness occurring. case poor
Natasha - realize just done way way much went hung
bow hunting friend trained way hard, realize, oh, goodness,
going sore here. can immediately put compression gear weigh
really long possible. examples compression gear? seen
people plane high high socks um, mean anything wear
compression gear exercise. whether just know,
compression pants leggings tight fitting leggings uh, whether long sleeve
shirt, that’s like rash guard, wear know Jiu, Jitsu surfing, something
like that. long it’s tight fitting, doesn't much can wear.
suppose get socks, great, generally just tell leads them.
put long sleeve compression shirts wear training
long, compression, leggings that'd fine. Can people apply compression
um Garb training still get positive effects yeah? not seen
evidence suggest block adaptation. may case. not aware
studies happens, certainly know information suggests can
hands little bit Muscle Recovery. ideally one knows workout
trigger lot soreness yeah compression gear sort
offset that, local muscle groups working
Reason asked socks understanding. socks uh, compression


socks people plane it’s going shift patterns blood flow, not just
lower legs, body yeah you're, probably going want focus
actual exercising tissue, though, Actually, that’s really good question. don't know
answer whether not upper body workout lower body compression
gear. actually help that’s great question. may done. don't know,
don't know answer general, just tell people like where, whole
thing much can um, actually not concerned wearing
workout. something put afterwards even wear just little bit
compression day. Um actually really fun study. Uh. collaborated
um Bill Kramer who's. Uh, know, Sports scientist Year award. bill Cramer
award, gives indication uh University Connecticut, well Lee
Brown, two Lifetime Achievement Award winners put people plane
stores, Connecticut flew Cal State Fullerton. cross-country flight
got wear compression gear flight others not,
landed California training bout put back plane, went back stores
think another training bout got back there. lot data
came paper, one things clear compression group
effective handling blood related coagulation issues associated
long flights particularly athletic performance. that’s actually sneaky little Insider trick
use lot people, particularly athletes traveling, just wear
compression gear plane. talked sort rung study
mind another effective strategy, compression gear general, well
particularly plane, basically tighter can get better, without obviously
making hands purple uncomfortable things like that, doesn't
overly tight. Anything will work probably help. also personally,
anytime, taking

01:08:27 Tool: Acute Soreness, Massage, Temperature

flight like much can just feel little better get there.
methods can use alleviate acute soreness? Well, continue
theme, saying okay, use sort pressure manipulation
enhance recovery. compression one strategy, can also use things like compression
boots garments, nomadic devices will know, pump uh air outside
compress back forth. number devices will this. can


also use physical hand, massage body work they're, really
working best. can tell mechanisms effectively moving fluid
tissue, well potentially enhancing blood flow, increasing capitalization
going get nutrients waste products out. can kind pick
choose based upon budget preferences availability timing, things like that,
effective strategies outside really next largest category, now
thermal uh, far discussion, mentioned cold water, Immersion
talked hypertrophy section not want immediately: post
exercise, getting cold water ice bath trying grow muscle
mass. said that, good evidence showing cold water immersion
specifically effective reducing muscle soreness. fair consideration it’s
classic example no free passes physiology. Nothing always good
always bad. It’s always willing give versus willing
get case like cold water immersion? may thinking yeah. might want
hypertrophic adaptations, phase training,
actually trying push towards optimization moment, rather long-term
adaptation, ice bath might great choice. addition, fall scenario
like Natasha - realize like just unbelievably sore - might cost three
four five six days training. might worth accelerate recovery
process couple days don't miss much training. it’s just it’s
algorithm, it’s equation. looking season trying compete
just done way way much exercise, really significant pain.
probably willing give small percentage eventual muscle growth
single session get pain cold strategies. Cold water immersion clearly
best approach rather cold air tactics. cold shower probably
not enough here. really want either moderately cold. maybe 40 50
degree, water probably north 15 minutes can sub 40 little maybe
five minutes get fact number studies um.
sort summarizing bunch kind one rather going Point
point. numbers just threw uh, assuming um uh Fahrenheit um,
seem seem really cold right uncomfortably cold. Absolutely always recommend
people ease protocol overall not immediately go 35 degree uh
cold water, never done uh. said, people comfortable
uncomfortable, always answer question: cold exactly?
agree very, cold much really really want get out,
able stay safely? Whatever value happens be, absolutely


need safe. said that, actually, xbt Retreats, put dozens, not
hundreds people point, uh immediately sub 35 degree water first time
ever done. know three minutes multiple rounds session, can handle it.
don't need go crazy. don't want kind play game right,
want really really cold short amount time, want like kind
cold longer amount time? really mistake can make
something like know, 65 degree water people not comfortable
know five ten minutes. It’s just not going be. It’s probably not going
effective. like man 35 is, absolutely crazy want 55 degree, water
literature area. it’s going say need probably
somewhere, almost really north 10 minutes, will actually show need
like well north 20 30 minutes. money rather go really really
cold get done five minutes, um personal preference one. can also
make little bit easier yourself. not nearly much evidence,
contrast. Stuff uh, go cold, hot sort back forth.
no really good rules terms much go, many rounds, long
cold long hot couple studies obviously
studies use numbers, doesn't mean tested See optimal,
big difference, can really just kind play feel hot good
Recovery. just careful going put blood flow
area, may walk additional acute swelling isn't going
put greater pressure there. kind play that. personally really like
hot Recovery. will feel - maybe not great moment, next day tend feel
really really good. addition, wake next morning really really hurting
super stiff, hot bath will help um quite bit, can play
protocols. Again, don't

01:14:21 Cold & Heat Contrast, Cold Shower vs. Immersion, Sauna & Fertility

nice absolutely no requirement so. just option interested
studies Dr Susanna soberg sure yeah not directly aimed alleviating soreness
recovery, increasing thermal capacity storage uh Brown adipose
tissue, not blubbery fat stuff around clavicles around heart help
generate body, heat rest metabolism on, numbers um
come not tested possible derivations just like


breathing. five minute sessions, knows? Maybe minute
equally effective. just constraints sorts studies, values
come with, seem good thresholds making sure
adaptation response triggered heat cold. ends 57 minutes per week,
total uncomfortable safe heat case sauna, can one session
breaking couple sessions day different days, 11
minutes per week. cold either one single session multiple sessions, one
um one break know multiple days one day
one. know hour sauna 11 minutes colder vice versa,
although seems little bit extreme, especially uninitiated.
numbers studied. point out, not lot really thorough
studies examining different cold protocols according temperature time requirements.
bit subjective, feel required establish routine, actually say
another time re-emphasize something. talked beginning
conversation, pain not defined outcome. It’s heavily influenced
perception, so, don't feel like work you, won't work. feel like
work fantastic, so. It’s challenging field get really objective data
always going little bit subjective nature. things, can tell
anecdotally: used hot cold contrast long time athletes. love
don't care everything between. it’s one things never
mandate it. course, can't mandate anything anyone work with, never
know like hey. interested great struggling area? want try this?
liked great struggling area, tried it. didn't love it.
Okay, fine, not find routes, will get lot ways enhance
recovery um. one hasn't even really come stopping problem
first place, not just treating symptoms, first line defense,
really need go back figure it’s happening begin with, Solution,
just different acute symptom management tactics. One final point uh,
deliberate, cold exposure. think worth mentioning one reasons shower
effective, not nearly effective cold water, immersion immersion ice
neck simply reason stated before, showers not
going get cold not going get know sub 40s. Also cold
showers haven't really studied much have, not nearly much
immersion people always ask just think challenges studying cold water
exposure shower, can't really control mango? much body
covered, whether not head stays different size bodies, Etc? Whereas


people come laboratory, can get cold large, know neck
is. know chin can make sure people's arms um legs
underneath, cold shower sure can make everyone face away toward
shower, it’s really tricky um variations described. said,
agree one wants use deliberate cold exposure, cold shower better
nothing cold immersion circulating, cold water ice bath better um
cold shower yeah? actually say looking recovery muscle soreness,
say cold shower, probably little, not going able
get enough cold water onto muscle, besides, basically head, maybe
try cold bath least get surface area coverage, yeah want
use cold shower awesome reasons cold shower. That’s totally great.
trying use recover low back glutes sore training
good way, it’s probably not going much immersion there.
actually also hit sneaky point, is, can't get water super cold, just
make water move. Jets stuff can turn anyone tried
like. Okay, can 40 degree. Bath awesome, try 60, water
moving right, break thermal layer. Normally little thin layer
water heating up. break up. It’s whole new world, yeah, absolutely
still cold. Water actually weaker way go correct can make
face stoic, make body circulate water around long
this. Maybe just one point heat uh: certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry,
sauna, steam saunas. Excuse me, jacuzzis can work pretty well yep um uh males.
looking conceive 60 days following uh uh following sauna um, hot tub realize
approaches severely limit number motile sperm um
substantially. people not trying conceive uh. Don'T think works
reliably enough, use form contraception yeah, people
trying conceive. really detrimental sperm Health right reason
people bring ice pack put groin near groin go
um, hard hot tub sauna. getting fine points,
um crude points, will pun intended, um, idea wouldn't want
anyone approach techniques compromise life goals, certainly not
allowed anywhere near things. uh, stage Life, just say
Natasha put x hanging Laird. reasons, like you're, not
going you're, not going none stuff, just wait right heat um heat


sperm relationship it’s not one that’s positive sperm


01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques

ways combine various types stimuli described inducing
recovery? talked breathing based tools which, adjust indeed
adjust oxygen carbon dioxide ratios Etc. guessing major effect
recovery going neural. It’s going deliberate, calm nervous system,
sympathetic, based uh, mentioned, yeah definitely, talked
movement based touch-based approaches. Um, will uh movement
circulate, certainly will circulate blood, also will generate contractions muscles yep
right, maybe, if, indeed again, still speculates you, indeed soreness
due excessive stretch swelling stretch, ends muscles
make sense movement touch thermal, ways combine
um effective maybe even synergistic yeah. suppose throw uh
compression garments put Pneumatic compression device sit sauna.
regulate breath like fine. Quite honestly, though,
probably don't need maximize them. joking. probably go
light swim regulating breathing cold water. get compression
cold, water good spot, certainly that. reality
is. generally look physical approach holistic approach breath
work. Basically, want breath something else knock two things
good spot, breath thermal stress, just
controlling unregulation stuff. also remember ice stressor
actually show data second actually can enhance
systemic recovery, although won't happen acute minutes. fact, it’s going
take least 30 60 minutes eventually see rebound effect, acutely it’s
going make actually sympathetic, going direction. can
opposite can actually drive up. it’s little bit dependent upon
respond, time day you're, using general, guess combining
need um, depending available. perhaps don't
sauna, can take hot bath great. Maybe percussion device
tool can use that. don't sauna amazing. don't ice bath


things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

back off - case. happen gymnasts
cheerleader things take month off barely seeing
start come back Baseline numbers. number areas, mood desire
train testosterone, cortisol ratios biomarkers number areas - physical performance,
vertical jump height, like things just start get back Baseline, true
training actually quite rare. Non-Functional overreaching much common
shorter time frame scale. talk recovery, four pieces
really thinking about, so, concerned about, oh super sore.
get less sore? either not sore next time? workout
super sorry. Now. recover playing first category overload
can certainly talk figure out. quick answer got go back
previous episodes just pay attention volume intensity recommendations
getting significantly uh damage fatigue workout? probably
increased volume quickly, something else dragging stress bucket down,
generally, problem training. Um either didn't warm sufficiently.
fueling strategy off talk Next Episode violated. One
principles increasing intensity volume sort quickly, it’s past
getting stage you're, just like feeling beat time energy going
down, just not feeling like recovered. Now overreaching stage,
story kind tell always years ago working wife Natasha
garage training something like comes stumbling
look Eyes like eyeballs, giant she's, just like wobbling she's.
Like effed up, like mean like effed she's? Just like, read
program wrong like Trump like what'd. like supposed
10 sets three every minute minute three sets ten every minute
minute absolutely wrecked. couldn't move hours afterwards
days, she's. Just like handle kids like, can't get bed.
can't move like classic example right like don't need fix recovery
here, you're, just dummy, dream way hard long like not
don't problem here. it’s situation like that, it’s generally just program
way off. it’s constantly happening you're, just like man like whatever reason,
every while, getting really sore really bad performance
workouts, need go stress bucket. Take look allostatic load
allostasis get figured happening um.




00:48:19 Overreaching vs. Overtraining

happy pointed distinction functional overreaching, training
trained. think one one common mistake people make thinking
biology generally think terms nouns adjectives not verbs amazing.
love much know, biology collection processes processes depending
live, trained trained state that,
many ways, adjective trained trained. It’s like saying, uh,
know American, know Czechoslovakian whatever happens, right
many ways people start associate identity, least transient identity,
start making sorts decisions. sounds like sorts verbs will
will not engage in, whereas think look things processes assign verbs
them, can say: okay, functionally overreaching truly training,
matter Degrees, correct right training matter, not reaching,
not functionally reaching it’s just it’s just performance, know, just
nervous system, won't change unless give reason reason why,
can Perform something perfectly speak language perfectly. no rewiring
nervous system. myth told every experience rewires
nervous system, it’s different now two seconds ago. That’s that’s ridiculous,
illogical statement. know. That’s not true nervous system can perform something,
no reason change won't muscles way.
progressively overload learn something new challenge muscle
something new, it’s thing. example gave uh wife
workout turned far strenuous, functionally overreach.
sense, might training heading direction training,
mistake assume trained right, kind it’s almost becomes
bit state character assignment um, opposed verb, case,
no perfect way describe - talking nouns adjectives also
um talking verbs. think verbs really anchored processes
things actions can take um. may, like just highlight this,
idea shifting one sinking towards verb actions rather labels state
happen person happen right. Sometimes even become
kind character. Logical way people describe uh, believe
something called training training real words,
don't ever really know trained, nailed it. there's. No, know it’s
not like red flag. Uh, know shoots shoulder say trained.


know it’s um, so, hope can start thinking verbs,
actions can take order ensure stimulate Progressive, overload
one way another time, don't fall bins character
assignment suddenly decide need X like take month off
something like that, beginning realize um discussion that’s
exactly wrong way go. fantastic points want make sure clear
no clinical diagnosis training. no standards, no test
blood panel. can pull. actually identify state.
distinction Here, Andrew verbs, rather nouns is, wonderful
exactly case. way really come retroactively, diagnose
one training is, had. weeks recovery got back
Baseline, can't moment. can't take single test, no subjective
marker anything says trained. simply, probably training,
need reverse quickly case step probably non-
functionally overreaching. continue this, will probably enter new stage
training need come back. that’s important thing
let people know no one thing actually point says

00:52:53 Tool: Acute Overload & Recovery, Breathwork

not noun, verb. tools can use
enhance recovery yep? start off acute overload phase. So, words,
just workout feeling awful just one two days ago super sore.
get rid right now? Well, couple things can immediately
workout others maybe actionable day later two days
later just cover handful them. nutrition hydration
supplementation next episode. going cover everything else, not category
right now, couple things number one. can actually start Kickstart recovery
process end current training session, guess say way.
strongly suggest start recovery process immediately workout
mentioned earlier idea got get really high peak stress cause
adaptation, actually didn't explain correctly, happen
need extremely High peak, met extremely sharp
recovery back down, know talked
neuroplasticity stuff terms happen caused insult.


immediately need able recover make sure causes changes brains
thing happens here. need really sharp high inflammatory response
then, not meet immediate recovery period, signal won't
maximize results. mean can actually couple things? Number
one actually listening slow, paced, music evidence suggest fast-paced music
may slow recovery slow pace actually enhance it. just change
know maximum get get going music workout
slower, lower Cadence will help kick start idea similar note. can also
use call regulation breathing. conjunction one
other, whichever you, personal favorite method somewhere
three ten minutes finishing training session. Laying like
position, certainly Lotus position, think laying back
generally effective personal preference there, no science, like items
covered getting dark quiet sort area Then, just breathing nose
structured, Cadence, lot different things. can try easy example. just
box breathing can imagine box four squares. going
inhale somewhere between, like three eight seconds whatever number
choose, keep tempo, say chose five second inhale,
that’s going take vertically horizontally box five second hold
five second exhale five second hold, just need repeat
time domain. Now typically honestly don't use timer you'll, actually notice. lot
people will like fall asleep get really close falling asleep period. can
triangle version that, inhale, hold exhale go right back
inhale bunch different tricks. can try here, need play around
see actually works best you. Um 10 minutes probably better, can just
least give three that'll work, really really resistant, can actually that. Just
shower, going finish workout get shower again, just close
eyes shower, give three minutes focused relaxation breathing will
accelerate recovery process. love particularly love laboratory
works stress respiration, okay, breathing interactions two
just mention result just accepted publication, time day.
uh. Thank you. Uh beautiful work uh, not directly, although took
place lab, know, it’s students doctors um, Dr Melise uh, balbon
uh lab. It’s phenomenal researcher showed short period five minutes
box breathing exactly type described cyclic sign two inhales, followed
extended exhale lungs empty. Ideally, inhales done nose.


exhales done. Uh mouth, although done nose, um
mouth matter, probably nose. Nose inhale, inhale mouth exhale
um uh inhales, nose exhale nose. Cyclic sighing,
refer done five minutes, produce significant decreases resting
heart rate. time will increase things like heart rate, variability
forth. Um provided extended exhales. seems like calming response,
reduction overall stress occurs. thing really sends things
direction something like cyclic hyperventilation. sure observed um
interestingly uh, people just five minutes meditation which,
which, course, breathing just allowing breathing progress.
However, happens moment, um moments across five minutes uh.
reductions sorts markers stress described not significant
breathing. love Brock's breathing tool, post, workout, um
Alternatives too, just mentioned, think people greatly underestimate
potency breathing shifting one's nervous system function away stress one
wants toward alertness stress. actually couple questions
sure. think audience appreciate uh. long boxes? just
user selected great question, use carbon dioxide tolerance test amazing order
people determine long different sides Box be, cover
carbon dioxide tolerance tests. previous episode, can provide link clip um
show, note captions, but, point out, involves long extended exhale lungs,
empty um and, course, people sit lungs empty, accurately
Faithfully say report long took empty lungs. use
gauge. Typically, takes, people go lungs empty 20 seconds less, believe
go back paper look, believe duration sides
boxes were, somewhere um two three seconds,
CO2 discard time anywhere uh 20 seconds 40 45 seconds, use it.
sides box, believe, four six seconds people
longer discard Arrow period minute more. used
box duration inhale, hold exhale, hold duration somewhere between. believe
[ Music, ], um, seven, maybe eight long 11 12 seconds yeah.
will get kind free diver types. can really this? really well
trained sort thing? don't quote exactly numbers,
approximate. line exactly done. believe it’s it’s going
close within seconds non-important Distinction. it’s going close enough,
that’s great, uh. took six weeks. study done


period month swapped new pattern breathing um,
condition meditation condition - done natural world, say, um
wearing whoop bands. getting heart rate, heart rate, variability, sleep,
data, subjective data mood Etc. lot measures, um
100 subjects wild life um tried best track life, stress
events exercise, things like harder control outside laboratory.
Really results speak exactly exactly describing here,
deliberate respiration involves controlled holds exhales really dramatic
immediate impact reducing levels stress. That’s wonderful! not surprised
findings really interesting that, mentioned
exhalation portion primarily responsible regulation that’s actually goes
back previous endurance conversation, general rest, non-altitude
increases Co2 primary driver ventilation, generally means
inhales associated uptick sympathetic State exhales associated
uptick parasympathetic State. generally, folks will things like exhale
finish exhale right perform high Precision, neurological tasks.
going say, aim Target shoot going Exhale fully almost
always execute movement end exhale, that’s
highest parasympathetic State lowest drive ventilation. say not surprised
guys found actually data point individuals, particularly
endurance. Training can get back Baseline heart rate going
correlated with. gets actual results training. Said take
bunch individuals put endurance training program,
measure quickly can get back Baseline workout general,
folks better going see greater improvements Performance
end say, four six eight week, training block little bit
causation correlation untie. think it’s enough say: hey
invest three case study five minutes. It’s going
enhance recovery, likelihood increasing results training, now
also additional benefits like able transition appropriately next
task, going work going see family whatever thing is, it’s it’s nice close to,
asked high, sympathetic State body, asked perform
stress. gave recovery now ready transition next thing
don't take exercise energy. will next

01:03:39 Tool: Alleviate Acute Soreness, Compression Clothing



task may may not want sympathetic Drive state. somebody sore
following workout, either locally sore muscle, group group muscles, maybe
legs chest torso maybe whole body sore sometimes case.
tools can Implement order accelerate the? want call
moving soreness, it’s really, know, alleviation soreness
bunch different processes. effective tools push back
soreness dissipate yeah? Absolutely. First all, it’s not lactate! That’s just really
important thing still hear people talk about. know sore 24 hours later
got thing get lactate there, talked metabolism,
uh conversation episode not cause fatigue it’s certainly not
cause soreness. not actionable tip there, just pet peeve mine. hear
people say get irritated can maybe end conversation um strategies,
tools, can do, can actually wear compression gear will help little
bit. decent amount evidence, suggesting, just you, know, put
tighter fitting clothes Leisure, wear compression gear. can
actually prevent little bit soreness occurring. case poor
Natasha - realize just done way way much went hung
bow hunting friend trained way hard, realize, oh, goodness,
going sore here. can immediately put compression gear weigh
really long possible. examples compression gear? seen
people plane high high socks um, mean anything wear
compression gear exercise. whether just know,
compression pants leggings tight fitting leggings uh, whether long sleeve
shirt, that’s like rash guard, wear know Jiu, Jitsu surfing, something
like that. long it’s tight fitting, doesn't much can wear.
suppose get socks, great, generally just tell leads them.
put long sleeve compression shirts wear training
long, compression, leggings that'd fine. Can people apply compression
um Garb training still get positive effects yeah? not seen
evidence suggest block adaptation. may case. not aware
studies happens, certainly know information suggests can
hands little bit Muscle Recovery. ideally one knows workout
trigger lot soreness yeah compression gear sort
offset that, local muscle groups working
Reason asked socks understanding. socks uh, compression


socks people plane it’s going shift patterns blood flow, not just
lower legs, body yeah you're, probably going want focus
actual exercising tissue, though, Actually, that’s really good question. don't know
answer whether not upper body workout lower body compression
gear. actually help that’s great question. may done. don't know,
don't know answer general, just tell people like where, whole
thing much can um, actually not concerned wearing
workout. something put afterwards even wear just little bit
compression day. Um actually really fun study. Uh. collaborated
um Bill Kramer who's. Uh, know, Sports scientist Year award. bill Cramer
award, gives indication uh University Connecticut, well Lee
Brown, two Lifetime Achievement Award winners put people plane
stores, Connecticut flew Cal State Fullerton. cross-country flight
got wear compression gear flight others not,
landed California training bout put back plane, went back stores
think another training bout got back there. lot data
came paper, one things clear compression group
effective handling blood related coagulation issues associated
long flights particularly athletic performance. that’s actually sneaky little Insider trick
use lot people, particularly athletes traveling, just wear
compression gear plane. talked sort rung study
mind another effective strategy, compression gear general, well
particularly plane, basically tighter can get better, without obviously
making hands purple uncomfortable things like that, doesn't
overly tight. Anything will work probably help. also personally,
anytime, taking

01:08:27 Tool: Acute Soreness, Massage, Temperature

flight like much can just feel little better get there.
methods can use alleviate acute soreness? Well, continue
theme, saying okay, use sort pressure manipulation
enhance recovery. compression one strategy, can also use things like compression
boots garments, nomadic devices will know, pump uh air outside
compress back forth. number devices will this. can


also use physical hand, massage body work they're, really
working best. can tell mechanisms effectively moving fluid
tissue, well potentially enhancing blood flow, increasing capitalization
going get nutrients waste products out. can kind pick
choose based upon budget preferences availability timing, things like that,
effective strategies outside really next largest category, now
thermal uh, far discussion, mentioned cold water, Immersion
talked hypertrophy section not want immediately: post
exercise, getting cold water ice bath trying grow muscle
mass. said that, good evidence showing cold water immersion
specifically effective reducing muscle soreness. fair consideration it’s
classic example no free passes physiology. Nothing always good
always bad. It’s always willing give versus willing
get case like cold water immersion? may thinking yeah. might want
hypertrophic adaptations, phase training,
actually trying push towards optimization moment, rather long-term
adaptation, ice bath might great choice. addition, fall scenario
like Natasha - realize like just unbelievably sore - might cost three
four five six days training. might worth accelerate recovery
process couple days don't miss much training. it’s just it’s
algorithm, it’s equation. looking season trying compete
just done way way much exercise, really significant pain.
probably willing give small percentage eventual muscle growth
single session get pain cold strategies. Cold water immersion clearly
best approach rather cold air tactics. cold shower probably
not enough here. really want either moderately cold. maybe 40 50
degree, water probably north 15 minutes can sub 40 little maybe
five minutes get fact number studies um.
sort summarizing bunch kind one rather going Point
point. numbers just threw uh, assuming um uh Fahrenheit um,
seem seem really cold right uncomfortably cold. Absolutely always recommend
people ease protocol overall not immediately go 35 degree uh
cold water, never done uh. said, people comfortable
uncomfortable, always answer question: cold exactly?
agree very, cold much really really want get out,
able stay safely? Whatever value happens be, absolutely


need safe. said that, actually, xbt Retreats, put dozens, not
hundreds people point, uh immediately sub 35 degree water first time
ever done. know three minutes multiple rounds session, can handle it.
don't need go crazy. don't want kind play game right,
want really really cold short amount time, want like kind
cold longer amount time? really mistake can make
something like know, 65 degree water people not comfortable
know five ten minutes. It’s just not going be. It’s probably not going
effective. like man 35 is, absolutely crazy want 55 degree, water
literature area. it’s going say need probably
somewhere, almost really north 10 minutes, will actually show need
like well north 20 30 minutes. money rather go really really
cold get done five minutes, um personal preference one. can also
make little bit easier yourself. not nearly much evidence,
contrast. Stuff uh, go cold, hot sort back forth.
no really good rules terms much go, many rounds, long
cold long hot couple studies obviously
studies use numbers, doesn't mean tested See optimal,
big difference, can really just kind play feel hot good
Recovery. just careful going put blood flow
area, may walk additional acute swelling isn't going
put greater pressure there. kind play that. personally really like
hot Recovery. will feel - maybe not great moment, next day tend feel
really really good. addition, wake next morning really really hurting
super stiff, hot bath will help um quite bit, can play
protocols. Again, don't

01:14:21 Cold & Heat Contrast, Cold Shower vs. Immersion, Sauna & Fertility

nice absolutely no requirement so. just option interested
studies Dr Susanna soberg sure yeah not directly aimed alleviating soreness
recovery, increasing thermal capacity storage uh Brown adipose
tissue, not blubbery fat stuff around clavicles around heart help
generate body, heat rest metabolism on, numbers um
come not tested possible derivations just like


breathing. five minute sessions, knows? Maybe minute
equally effective. just constraints sorts studies, values
come with, seem good thresholds making sure
adaptation response triggered heat cold. ends 57 minutes per week,
total uncomfortable safe heat case sauna, can one session
breaking couple sessions day different days, 11
minutes per week. cold either one single session multiple sessions, one
um one break know multiple days one day
one. know hour sauna 11 minutes colder vice versa,
although seems little bit extreme, especially uninitiated.
numbers studied. point out, not lot really thorough
studies examining different cold protocols according temperature time requirements.
bit subjective, feel required establish routine, actually say
another time re-emphasize something. talked beginning
conversation, pain not defined outcome. It’s heavily influenced
perception, so, don't feel like work you, won't work. feel like
work fantastic, so. It’s challenging field get really objective data
always going little bit subjective nature. things, can tell
anecdotally: used hot cold contrast long time athletes. love
don't care everything between. it’s one things never
mandate it. course, can't mandate anything anyone work with, never
know like hey. interested great struggling area? want try this?
liked great struggling area, tried it. didn't love it.
Okay, fine, not find routes, will get lot ways enhance
recovery um. one hasn't even really come stopping problem
first place, not just treating symptoms, first line defense,
really need go back figure it’s happening begin with, Solution,
just different acute symptom management tactics. One final point uh,
deliberate, cold exposure. think worth mentioning one reasons shower
effective, not nearly effective cold water, immersion immersion ice
neck simply reason stated before, showers not
going get cold not going get know sub 40s. Also cold
showers haven't really studied much have, not nearly much
immersion people always ask just think challenges studying cold water
exposure shower, can't really control mango? much body
covered, whether not head stays different size bodies, Etc? Whereas


people come laboratory, can get cold large, know neck
is. know chin can make sure people's arms um legs
underneath, cold shower sure can make everyone face away toward
shower, it’s really tricky um variations described. said,
agree one wants use deliberate cold exposure, cold shower better
nothing cold immersion circulating, cold water ice bath better um
cold shower yeah? actually say looking recovery muscle soreness,
say cold shower, probably little, not going able
get enough cold water onto muscle, besides, basically head, maybe
try cold bath least get surface area coverage, yeah want
use cold shower awesome reasons cold shower. That’s totally great.
trying use recover low back glutes sore training
good way, it’s probably not going much immersion there.
actually also hit sneaky point, is, can't get water super cold, just
make water move. Jets stuff can turn anyone tried
like. Okay, can 40 degree. Bath awesome, try 60, water
moving right, break thermal layer. Normally little thin layer
water heating up. break up. It’s whole new world, yeah, absolutely
still cold. Water actually weaker way go correct can make
face stoic, make body circulate water around long
this. Maybe just one point heat uh: certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry,
sauna, steam saunas. Excuse me, jacuzzis can work pretty well yep um uh males.
looking conceive 60 days following uh uh following sauna um, hot tub realize
approaches severely limit number motile sperm um
substantially. people not trying conceive uh. Don'T think works
reliably enough, use form contraception yeah, people
trying conceive. really detrimental sperm Health right reason
people bring ice pack put groin near groin go
um, hard hot tub sauna. getting fine points,
um crude points, will pun intended, um, idea wouldn't want
anyone approach techniques compromise life goals, certainly not
allowed anywhere near things. uh, stage Life, just say
Natasha put x hanging Laird. reasons, like you're, not
going you're, not going none stuff, just wait right heat um heat


sperm relationship it’s not one that’s positive sperm


01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques

ways combine various types stimuli described inducing
recovery? talked breathing based tools which, adjust indeed
adjust oxygen carbon dioxide ratios Etc. guessing major effect
recovery going neural. It’s going deliberate, calm nervous system,
sympathetic, based uh, mentioned, yeah definitely, talked
movement based touch-based approaches. Um, will uh movement
circulate, certainly will circulate blood, also will generate contractions muscles yep
right, maybe, if, indeed again, still speculates you, indeed soreness
due excessive stretch swelling stretch, ends muscles
make sense movement touch thermal, ways combine
um effective maybe even synergistic yeah. suppose throw uh
compression garments put Pneumatic compression device sit sauna.
regulate breath like fine. Quite honestly, though,
probably don't need maximize them. joking. probably go
light swim regulating breathing cold water. get compression
cold, water good spot, certainly that. reality
is. generally look physical approach holistic approach breath
work. Basically, want breath something else knock two things
good spot, breath thermal stress, just
controlling unregulation stuff. also remember ice stressor
actually show data second actually can enhance
systemic recovery, although won't happen acute minutes. fact, it’s going
take least 30 60 minutes eventually see rebound effect, acutely it’s
going make actually sympathetic, going direction. can
opposite can actually drive up. it’s little bit dependent upon
respond, time day you're, using general, guess combining
need um, depending available. perhaps don't
sauna, can take hot bath great. Maybe percussion device
tool can use that. don't sauna amazing. don't ice bath


things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food

00:48:19 Overreaching vs. Overtraining

happy pointed distinction functional overreaching, training
trained. think one one common mistake people make thinking
biology generally think terms nouns adjectives not verbs amazing.
love much know, biology collection processes processes depending
live, trained trained state that,
many ways, adjective trained trained. It’s like saying, uh,
know American, know Czechoslovakian whatever happens, right
many ways people start associate identity, least transient identity,
start making sorts decisions. sounds like sorts verbs will
will not engage in, whereas think look things processes assign verbs
them, can say: okay, functionally overreaching truly training,
matter Degrees, correct right training matter, not reaching,
not functionally reaching it’s just it’s just performance, know, just
nervous system, won't change unless give reason reason why,
can Perform something perfectly speak language perfectly. no rewiring
nervous system. myth told every experience rewires
nervous system, it’s different now two seconds ago. That’s that’s ridiculous,
illogical statement. know. That’s not true nervous system can perform something,
no reason change won't muscles way.
progressively overload learn something new challenge muscle
something new, it’s thing. example gave uh wife
workout turned far strenuous, functionally overreach.
sense, might training heading direction training,
mistake assume trained right, kind it’s almost becomes
bit state character assignment um, opposed verb, case,
no perfect way describe - talking nouns adjectives also
um talking verbs. think verbs really anchored processes
things actions can take um. may, like just highlight this,
idea shifting one sinking towards verb actions rather labels state
happen person happen right. Sometimes even become
kind character. Logical way people describe uh, believe
something called training training real words,
don't ever really know trained, nailed it. there's. No, know it’s
not like red flag. Uh, know shoots shoulder say trained.


know it’s um, so, hope can start thinking verbs,
actions can take order ensure stimulate Progressive, overload
one way another time, don't fall bins character
assignment suddenly decide need X like take month off
something like that, beginning realize um discussion that’s
exactly wrong way go. fantastic points want make sure clear
no clinical diagnosis training. no standards, no test
blood panel. can pull. actually identify state.
distinction Here, Andrew verbs, rather nouns is, wonderful
exactly case. way really come retroactively, diagnose
one training is, had. weeks recovery got back
Baseline, can't moment. can't take single test, no subjective
marker anything says trained. simply, probably training,
need reverse quickly case step probably non-
functionally overreaching. continue this, will probably enter new stage
training need come back. that’s important thing
let people know no one thing actually point says

00:52:53 Tool: Acute Overload & Recovery, Breathwork

not noun, verb. tools can use
enhance recovery yep? start off acute overload phase. So, words,
just workout feeling awful just one two days ago super sore.
get rid right now? Well, couple things can immediately
workout others maybe actionable day later two days
later just cover handful them. nutrition hydration
supplementation next episode. going cover everything else, not category
right now, couple things number one. can actually start Kickstart recovery
process end current training session, guess say way.
strongly suggest start recovery process immediately workout
mentioned earlier idea got get really high peak stress cause
adaptation, actually didn't explain correctly, happen
need extremely High peak, met extremely sharp
recovery back down, know talked
neuroplasticity stuff terms happen caused insult.


immediately need able recover make sure causes changes brains
thing happens here. need really sharp high inflammatory response
then, not meet immediate recovery period, signal won't
maximize results. mean can actually couple things? Number
one actually listening slow, paced, music evidence suggest fast-paced music
may slow recovery slow pace actually enhance it. just change
know maximum get get going music workout
slower, lower Cadence will help kick start idea similar note. can also
use call regulation breathing. conjunction one
other, whichever you, personal favorite method somewhere
three ten minutes finishing training session. Laying like
position, certainly Lotus position, think laying back
generally effective personal preference there, no science, like items
covered getting dark quiet sort area Then, just breathing nose
structured, Cadence, lot different things. can try easy example. just
box breathing can imagine box four squares. going
inhale somewhere between, like three eight seconds whatever number
choose, keep tempo, say chose five second inhale,
that’s going take vertically horizontally box five second hold
five second exhale five second hold, just need repeat
time domain. Now typically honestly don't use timer you'll, actually notice. lot
people will like fall asleep get really close falling asleep period. can
triangle version that, inhale, hold exhale go right back
inhale bunch different tricks. can try here, need play around
see actually works best you. Um 10 minutes probably better, can just
least give three that'll work, really really resistant, can actually that. Just
shower, going finish workout get shower again, just close
eyes shower, give three minutes focused relaxation breathing will
accelerate recovery process. love particularly love laboratory
works stress respiration, okay, breathing interactions two
just mention result just accepted publication, time day.
uh. Thank you. Uh beautiful work uh, not directly, although took
place lab, know, it’s students doctors um, Dr Melise uh, balbon
uh lab. It’s phenomenal researcher showed short period five minutes
box breathing exactly type described cyclic sign two inhales, followed
extended exhale lungs empty. Ideally, inhales done nose.


exhales done. Uh mouth, although done nose, um
mouth matter, probably nose. Nose inhale, inhale mouth exhale
um uh inhales, nose exhale nose. Cyclic sighing,
refer done five minutes, produce significant decreases resting
heart rate. time will increase things like heart rate, variability
forth. Um provided extended exhales. seems like calming response,
reduction overall stress occurs. thing really sends things
direction something like cyclic hyperventilation. sure observed um
interestingly uh, people just five minutes meditation which,
which, course, breathing just allowing breathing progress.
However, happens moment, um moments across five minutes uh.
reductions sorts markers stress described not significant
breathing. love Brock's breathing tool, post, workout, um
Alternatives too, just mentioned, think people greatly underestimate
potency breathing shifting one's nervous system function away stress one
wants toward alertness stress. actually couple questions
sure. think audience appreciate uh. long boxes? just
user selected great question, use carbon dioxide tolerance test amazing order
people determine long different sides Box be, cover
carbon dioxide tolerance tests. previous episode, can provide link clip um
show, note captions, but, point out, involves long extended exhale lungs,
empty um and, course, people sit lungs empty, accurately
Faithfully say report long took empty lungs. use
gauge. Typically, takes, people go lungs empty 20 seconds less, believe
go back paper look, believe duration sides
boxes were, somewhere um two three seconds,
CO2 discard time anywhere uh 20 seconds 40 45 seconds, use it.
sides box, believe, four six seconds people
longer discard Arrow period minute more. used
box duration inhale, hold exhale, hold duration somewhere between. believe
[ Music, ], um, seven, maybe eight long 11 12 seconds yeah.
will get kind free diver types. can really this? really well
trained sort thing? don't quote exactly numbers,
approximate. line exactly done. believe it’s it’s going
close within seconds non-important Distinction. it’s going close enough,
that’s great, uh. took six weeks. study done


period month swapped new pattern breathing um,
condition meditation condition - done natural world, say, um
wearing whoop bands. getting heart rate, heart rate, variability, sleep,
data, subjective data mood Etc. lot measures, um
100 subjects wild life um tried best track life, stress
events exercise, things like harder control outside laboratory.
Really results speak exactly exactly describing here,
deliberate respiration involves controlled holds exhales really dramatic
immediate impact reducing levels stress. That’s wonderful! not surprised
findings really interesting that, mentioned
exhalation portion primarily responsible regulation that’s actually goes
back previous endurance conversation, general rest, non-altitude
increases Co2 primary driver ventilation, generally means
inhales associated uptick sympathetic State exhales associated
uptick parasympathetic State. generally, folks will things like exhale
finish exhale right perform high Precision, neurological tasks.
going say, aim Target shoot going Exhale fully almost
always execute movement end exhale, that’s
highest parasympathetic State lowest drive ventilation. say not surprised
guys found actually data point individuals, particularly
endurance. Training can get back Baseline heart rate going
correlated with. gets actual results training. Said take
bunch individuals put endurance training program,
measure quickly can get back Baseline workout general,
folks better going see greater improvements Performance
end say, four six eight week, training block little bit
causation correlation untie. think it’s enough say: hey
invest three case study five minutes. It’s going
enhance recovery, likelihood increasing results training, now
also additional benefits like able transition appropriately next
task, going work going see family whatever thing is, it’s it’s nice close to,
asked high, sympathetic State body, asked perform
stress. gave recovery now ready transition next thing
don't take exercise energy. will next

01:03:39 Tool: Alleviate Acute Soreness, Compression Clothing



task may may not want sympathetic Drive state. somebody sore
following workout, either locally sore muscle, group group muscles, maybe
legs chest torso maybe whole body sore sometimes case.
tools can Implement order accelerate the? want call
moving soreness, it’s really, know, alleviation soreness
bunch different processes. effective tools push back
soreness dissipate yeah? Absolutely. First all, it’s not lactate! That’s just really
important thing still hear people talk about. know sore 24 hours later
got thing get lactate there, talked metabolism,
uh conversation episode not cause fatigue it’s certainly not
cause soreness. not actionable tip there, just pet peeve mine. hear
people say get irritated can maybe end conversation um strategies,
tools, can do, can actually wear compression gear will help little
bit. decent amount evidence, suggesting, just you, know, put
tighter fitting clothes Leisure, wear compression gear. can
actually prevent little bit soreness occurring. case poor
Natasha - realize just done way way much went hung
bow hunting friend trained way hard, realize, oh, goodness,
going sore here. can immediately put compression gear weigh
really long possible. examples compression gear? seen
people plane high high socks um, mean anything wear
compression gear exercise. whether just know,
compression pants leggings tight fitting leggings uh, whether long sleeve
shirt, that’s like rash guard, wear know Jiu, Jitsu surfing, something
like that. long it’s tight fitting, doesn't much can wear.
suppose get socks, great, generally just tell leads them.
put long sleeve compression shirts wear training
long, compression, leggings that'd fine. Can people apply compression
um Garb training still get positive effects yeah? not seen
evidence suggest block adaptation. may case. not aware
studies happens, certainly know information suggests can
hands little bit Muscle Recovery. ideally one knows workout
trigger lot soreness yeah compression gear sort
offset that, local muscle groups working
Reason asked socks understanding. socks uh, compression


socks people plane it’s going shift patterns blood flow, not just
lower legs, body yeah you're, probably going want focus
actual exercising tissue, though, Actually, that’s really good question. don't know
answer whether not upper body workout lower body compression
gear. actually help that’s great question. may done. don't know,
don't know answer general, just tell people like where, whole
thing much can um, actually not concerned wearing
workout. something put afterwards even wear just little bit
compression day. Um actually really fun study. Uh. collaborated
um Bill Kramer who's. Uh, know, Sports scientist Year award. bill Cramer
award, gives indication uh University Connecticut, well Lee
Brown, two Lifetime Achievement Award winners put people plane
stores, Connecticut flew Cal State Fullerton. cross-country flight
got wear compression gear flight others not,
landed California training bout put back plane, went back stores
think another training bout got back there. lot data
came paper, one things clear compression group
effective handling blood related coagulation issues associated
long flights particularly athletic performance. that’s actually sneaky little Insider trick
use lot people, particularly athletes traveling, just wear
compression gear plane. talked sort rung study
mind another effective strategy, compression gear general, well
particularly plane, basically tighter can get better, without obviously
making hands purple uncomfortable things like that, doesn't
overly tight. Anything will work probably help. also personally,
anytime, taking

01:08:27 Tool: Acute Soreness, Massage, Temperature

flight like much can just feel little better get there.
methods can use alleviate acute soreness? Well, continue
theme, saying okay, use sort pressure manipulation
enhance recovery. compression one strategy, can also use things like compression
boots garments, nomadic devices will know, pump uh air outside
compress back forth. number devices will this. can


also use physical hand, massage body work they're, really
working best. can tell mechanisms effectively moving fluid
tissue, well potentially enhancing blood flow, increasing capitalization
going get nutrients waste products out. can kind pick
choose based upon budget preferences availability timing, things like that,
effective strategies outside really next largest category, now
thermal uh, far discussion, mentioned cold water, Immersion
talked hypertrophy section not want immediately: post
exercise, getting cold water ice bath trying grow muscle
mass. said that, good evidence showing cold water immersion
specifically effective reducing muscle soreness. fair consideration it’s
classic example no free passes physiology. Nothing always good
always bad. It’s always willing give versus willing
get case like cold water immersion? may thinking yeah. might want
hypertrophic adaptations, phase training,
actually trying push towards optimization moment, rather long-term
adaptation, ice bath might great choice. addition, fall scenario
like Natasha - realize like just unbelievably sore - might cost three
four five six days training. might worth accelerate recovery
process couple days don't miss much training. it’s just it’s
algorithm, it’s equation. looking season trying compete
just done way way much exercise, really significant pain.
probably willing give small percentage eventual muscle growth
single session get pain cold strategies. Cold water immersion clearly
best approach rather cold air tactics. cold shower probably
not enough here. really want either moderately cold. maybe 40 50
degree, water probably north 15 minutes can sub 40 little maybe
five minutes get fact number studies um.
sort summarizing bunch kind one rather going Point
point. numbers just threw uh, assuming um uh Fahrenheit um,
seem seem really cold right uncomfortably cold. Absolutely always recommend
people ease protocol overall not immediately go 35 degree uh
cold water, never done uh. said, people comfortable
uncomfortable, always answer question: cold exactly?
agree very, cold much really really want get out,
able stay safely? Whatever value happens be, absolutely


need safe. said that, actually, xbt Retreats, put dozens, not
hundreds people point, uh immediately sub 35 degree water first time
ever done. know three minutes multiple rounds session, can handle it.
don't need go crazy. don't want kind play game right,
want really really cold short amount time, want like kind
cold longer amount time? really mistake can make
something like know, 65 degree water people not comfortable
know five ten minutes. It’s just not going be. It’s probably not going
effective. like man 35 is, absolutely crazy want 55 degree, water
literature area. it’s going say need probably
somewhere, almost really north 10 minutes, will actually show need
like well north 20 30 minutes. money rather go really really
cold get done five minutes, um personal preference one. can also
make little bit easier yourself. not nearly much evidence,
contrast. Stuff uh, go cold, hot sort back forth.
no really good rules terms much go, many rounds, long
cold long hot couple studies obviously
studies use numbers, doesn't mean tested See optimal,
big difference, can really just kind play feel hot good
Recovery. just careful going put blood flow
area, may walk additional acute swelling isn't going
put greater pressure there. kind play that. personally really like
hot Recovery. will feel - maybe not great moment, next day tend feel
really really good. addition, wake next morning really really hurting
super stiff, hot bath will help um quite bit, can play
protocols. Again, don't

01:14:21 Cold & Heat Contrast, Cold Shower vs. Immersion, Sauna & Fertility

nice absolutely no requirement so. just option interested
studies Dr Susanna soberg sure yeah not directly aimed alleviating soreness
recovery, increasing thermal capacity storage uh Brown adipose
tissue, not blubbery fat stuff around clavicles around heart help
generate body, heat rest metabolism on, numbers um
come not tested possible derivations just like


breathing. five minute sessions, knows? Maybe minute
equally effective. just constraints sorts studies, values
come with, seem good thresholds making sure
adaptation response triggered heat cold. ends 57 minutes per week,
total uncomfortable safe heat case sauna, can one session
breaking couple sessions day different days, 11
minutes per week. cold either one single session multiple sessions, one
um one break know multiple days one day
one. know hour sauna 11 minutes colder vice versa,
although seems little bit extreme, especially uninitiated.
numbers studied. point out, not lot really thorough
studies examining different cold protocols according temperature time requirements.
bit subjective, feel required establish routine, actually say
another time re-emphasize something. talked beginning
conversation, pain not defined outcome. It’s heavily influenced
perception, so, don't feel like work you, won't work. feel like
work fantastic, so. It’s challenging field get really objective data
always going little bit subjective nature. things, can tell
anecdotally: used hot cold contrast long time athletes. love
don't care everything between. it’s one things never
mandate it. course, can't mandate anything anyone work with, never
know like hey. interested great struggling area? want try this?
liked great struggling area, tried it. didn't love it.
Okay, fine, not find routes, will get lot ways enhance
recovery um. one hasn't even really come stopping problem
first place, not just treating symptoms, first line defense,
really need go back figure it’s happening begin with, Solution,
just different acute symptom management tactics. One final point uh,
deliberate, cold exposure. think worth mentioning one reasons shower
effective, not nearly effective cold water, immersion immersion ice
neck simply reason stated before, showers not
going get cold not going get know sub 40s. Also cold
showers haven't really studied much have, not nearly much
immersion people always ask just think challenges studying cold water
exposure shower, can't really control mango? much body
covered, whether not head stays different size bodies, Etc? Whereas


people come laboratory, can get cold large, know neck
is. know chin can make sure people's arms um legs
underneath, cold shower sure can make everyone face away toward
shower, it’s really tricky um variations described. said,
agree one wants use deliberate cold exposure, cold shower better
nothing cold immersion circulating, cold water ice bath better um
cold shower yeah? actually say looking recovery muscle soreness,
say cold shower, probably little, not going able
get enough cold water onto muscle, besides, basically head, maybe
try cold bath least get surface area coverage, yeah want
use cold shower awesome reasons cold shower. That’s totally great.
trying use recover low back glutes sore training
good way, it’s probably not going much immersion there.
actually also hit sneaky point, is, can't get water super cold, just
make water move. Jets stuff can turn anyone tried
like. Okay, can 40 degree. Bath awesome, try 60, water
moving right, break thermal layer. Normally little thin layer
water heating up. break up. It’s whole new world, yeah, absolutely
still cold. Water actually weaker way go correct can make
face stoic, make body circulate water around long
this. Maybe just one point heat uh: certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry,
sauna, steam saunas. Excuse me, jacuzzis can work pretty well yep um uh males.
looking conceive 60 days following uh uh following sauna um, hot tub realize
approaches severely limit number motile sperm um
substantially. people not trying conceive uh. Don'T think works
reliably enough, use form contraception yeah, people
trying conceive. really detrimental sperm Health right reason
people bring ice pack put groin near groin go
um, hard hot tub sauna. getting fine points,
um crude points, will pun intended, um, idea wouldn't want
anyone approach techniques compromise life goals, certainly not
allowed anywhere near things. uh, stage Life, just say
Natasha put x hanging Laird. reasons, like you're, not
going you're, not going none stuff, just wait right heat um heat


sperm relationship it’s not one that’s positive sperm


01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques

ways combine various types stimuli described inducing
recovery? talked breathing based tools which, adjust indeed
adjust oxygen carbon dioxide ratios Etc. guessing major effect
recovery going neural. It’s going deliberate, calm nervous system,
sympathetic, based uh, mentioned, yeah definitely, talked
movement based touch-based approaches. Um, will uh movement
circulate, certainly will circulate blood, also will generate contractions muscles yep
right, maybe, if, indeed again, still speculates you, indeed soreness
due excessive stretch swelling stretch, ends muscles
make sense movement touch thermal, ways combine
um effective maybe even synergistic yeah. suppose throw uh
compression garments put Pneumatic compression device sit sauna.
regulate breath like fine. Quite honestly, though,
probably don't need maximize them. joking. probably go
light swim regulating breathing cold water. get compression
cold, water good spot, certainly that. reality
is. generally look physical approach holistic approach breath
work. Basically, want breath something else knock two things
good spot, breath thermal stress, just
controlling unregulation stuff. also remember ice stressor
actually show data second actually can enhance
systemic recovery, although won't happen acute minutes. fact, it’s going
take least 30 60 minutes eventually see rebound effect, acutely it’s
going make actually sympathetic, going direction. can
opposite can actually drive up. it’s little bit dependent upon
respond, time day you're, using general, guess combining
need um, depending available. perhaps don't
sauna, can take hot bath great. Maybe percussion device
tool can use that. don't sauna amazing. don't ice bath


things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

science [Music]


know it’s um, so, hope can start thinking verbs,
actions can take order ensure stimulate Progressive, overload
one way another time, don't fall bins character
assignment suddenly decide need X like take month off
something like that, beginning realize um discussion that’s
exactly wrong way go. fantastic points want make sure clear
no clinical diagnosis training. no standards, no test
blood panel. can pull. actually identify state.
distinction Here, Andrew verbs, rather nouns is, wonderful
exactly case. way really come retroactively, diagnose
one training is, had. weeks recovery got back
Baseline, can't moment. can't take single test, no subjective
marker anything says trained. simply, probably training,
need reverse quickly case step probably non-
functionally overreaching. continue this, will probably enter new stage
training need come back. that’s important thing
let people know no one thing actually point says

00:52:53 Tool: Acute Overload & Recovery, Breathwork

not noun, verb. tools can use
enhance recovery yep? start off acute overload phase. So, words,
just workout feeling awful just one two days ago super sore.
get rid right now? Well, couple things can immediately
workout others maybe actionable day later two days
later just cover handful them. nutrition hydration
supplementation next episode. going cover everything else, not category
right now, couple things number one. can actually start Kickstart recovery
process end current training session, guess say way.
strongly suggest start recovery process immediately workout
mentioned earlier idea got get really high peak stress cause
adaptation, actually didn't explain correctly, happen
need extremely High peak, met extremely sharp
recovery back down, know talked
neuroplasticity stuff terms happen caused insult.


immediately need able recover make sure causes changes brains
thing happens here. need really sharp high inflammatory response
then, not meet immediate recovery period, signal won't
maximize results. mean can actually couple things? Number
one actually listening slow, paced, music evidence suggest fast-paced music
may slow recovery slow pace actually enhance it. just change
know maximum get get going music workout
slower, lower Cadence will help kick start idea similar note. can also
use call regulation breathing. conjunction one
other, whichever you, personal favorite method somewhere
three ten minutes finishing training session. Laying like
position, certainly Lotus position, think laying back
generally effective personal preference there, no science, like items
covered getting dark quiet sort area Then, just breathing nose
structured, Cadence, lot different things. can try easy example. just
box breathing can imagine box four squares. going
inhale somewhere between, like three eight seconds whatever number
choose, keep tempo, say chose five second inhale,
that’s going take vertically horizontally box five second hold
five second exhale five second hold, just need repeat
time domain. Now typically honestly don't use timer you'll, actually notice. lot
people will like fall asleep get really close falling asleep period. can
triangle version that, inhale, hold exhale go right back
inhale bunch different tricks. can try here, need play around
see actually works best you. Um 10 minutes probably better, can just
least give three that'll work, really really resistant, can actually that. Just
shower, going finish workout get shower again, just close
eyes shower, give three minutes focused relaxation breathing will
accelerate recovery process. love particularly love laboratory
works stress respiration, okay, breathing interactions two
just mention result just accepted publication, time day.
uh. Thank you. Uh beautiful work uh, not directly, although took
place lab, know, it’s students doctors um, Dr Melise uh, balbon
uh lab. It’s phenomenal researcher showed short period five minutes
box breathing exactly type described cyclic sign two inhales, followed
extended exhale lungs empty. Ideally, inhales done nose.


exhales done. Uh mouth, although done nose, um
mouth matter, probably nose. Nose inhale, inhale mouth exhale
um uh inhales, nose exhale nose. Cyclic sighing,
refer done five minutes, produce significant decreases resting
heart rate. time will increase things like heart rate, variability
forth. Um provided extended exhales. seems like calming response,
reduction overall stress occurs. thing really sends things
direction something like cyclic hyperventilation. sure observed um
interestingly uh, people just five minutes meditation which,
which, course, breathing just allowing breathing progress.
However, happens moment, um moments across five minutes uh.
reductions sorts markers stress described not significant
breathing. love Brock's breathing tool, post, workout, um
Alternatives too, just mentioned, think people greatly underestimate
potency breathing shifting one's nervous system function away stress one
wants toward alertness stress. actually couple questions
sure. think audience appreciate uh. long boxes? just
user selected great question, use carbon dioxide tolerance test amazing order
people determine long different sides Box be, cover
carbon dioxide tolerance tests. previous episode, can provide link clip um
show, note captions, but, point out, involves long extended exhale lungs,
empty um and, course, people sit lungs empty, accurately
Faithfully say report long took empty lungs. use
gauge. Typically, takes, people go lungs empty 20 seconds less, believe
go back paper look, believe duration sides
boxes were, somewhere um two three seconds,
CO2 discard time anywhere uh 20 seconds 40 45 seconds, use it.
sides box, believe, four six seconds people
longer discard Arrow period minute more. used
box duration inhale, hold exhale, hold duration somewhere between. believe
[ Music, ], um, seven, maybe eight long 11 12 seconds yeah.
will get kind free diver types. can really this? really well
trained sort thing? don't quote exactly numbers,
approximate. line exactly done. believe it’s it’s going
close within seconds non-important Distinction. it’s going close enough,
that’s great, uh. took six weeks. study done


period month swapped new pattern breathing um,
condition meditation condition - done natural world, say, um
wearing whoop bands. getting heart rate, heart rate, variability, sleep,
data, subjective data mood Etc. lot measures, um
100 subjects wild life um tried best track life, stress
events exercise, things like harder control outside laboratory.
Really results speak exactly exactly describing here,
deliberate respiration involves controlled holds exhales really dramatic
immediate impact reducing levels stress. That’s wonderful! not surprised
findings really interesting that, mentioned
exhalation portion primarily responsible regulation that’s actually goes
back previous endurance conversation, general rest, non-altitude
increases Co2 primary driver ventilation, generally means
inhales associated uptick sympathetic State exhales associated
uptick parasympathetic State. generally, folks will things like exhale
finish exhale right perform high Precision, neurological tasks.
going say, aim Target shoot going Exhale fully almost
always execute movement end exhale, that’s
highest parasympathetic State lowest drive ventilation. say not surprised
guys found actually data point individuals, particularly
endurance. Training can get back Baseline heart rate going
correlated with. gets actual results training. Said take
bunch individuals put endurance training program,
measure quickly can get back Baseline workout general,
folks better going see greater improvements Performance
end say, four six eight week, training block little bit
causation correlation untie. think it’s enough say: hey
invest three case study five minutes. It’s going
enhance recovery, likelihood increasing results training, now
also additional benefits like able transition appropriately next
task, going work going see family whatever thing is, it’s it’s nice close to,
asked high, sympathetic State body, asked perform
stress. gave recovery now ready transition next thing
don't take exercise energy. will next

01:03:39 Tool: Alleviate Acute Soreness, Compression Clothing



task may may not want sympathetic Drive state. somebody sore
following workout, either locally sore muscle, group group muscles, maybe
legs chest torso maybe whole body sore sometimes case.
tools can Implement order accelerate the? want call
moving soreness, it’s really, know, alleviation soreness
bunch different processes. effective tools push back
soreness dissipate yeah? Absolutely. First all, it’s not lactate! That’s just really
important thing still hear people talk about. know sore 24 hours later
got thing get lactate there, talked metabolism,
uh conversation episode not cause fatigue it’s certainly not
cause soreness. not actionable tip there, just pet peeve mine. hear
people say get irritated can maybe end conversation um strategies,
tools, can do, can actually wear compression gear will help little
bit. decent amount evidence, suggesting, just you, know, put
tighter fitting clothes Leisure, wear compression gear. can
actually prevent little bit soreness occurring. case poor
Natasha - realize just done way way much went hung
bow hunting friend trained way hard, realize, oh, goodness,
going sore here. can immediately put compression gear weigh
really long possible. examples compression gear? seen
people plane high high socks um, mean anything wear
compression gear exercise. whether just know,
compression pants leggings tight fitting leggings uh, whether long sleeve
shirt, that’s like rash guard, wear know Jiu, Jitsu surfing, something
like that. long it’s tight fitting, doesn't much can wear.
suppose get socks, great, generally just tell leads them.
put long sleeve compression shirts wear training
long, compression, leggings that'd fine. Can people apply compression
um Garb training still get positive effects yeah? not seen
evidence suggest block adaptation. may case. not aware
studies happens, certainly know information suggests can
hands little bit Muscle Recovery. ideally one knows workout
trigger lot soreness yeah compression gear sort
offset that, local muscle groups working
Reason asked socks understanding. socks uh, compression


socks people plane it’s going shift patterns blood flow, not just
lower legs, body yeah you're, probably going want focus
actual exercising tissue, though, Actually, that’s really good question. don't know
answer whether not upper body workout lower body compression
gear. actually help that’s great question. may done. don't know,
don't know answer general, just tell people like where, whole
thing much can um, actually not concerned wearing
workout. something put afterwards even wear just little bit
compression day. Um actually really fun study. Uh. collaborated
um Bill Kramer who's. Uh, know, Sports scientist Year award. bill Cramer
award, gives indication uh University Connecticut, well Lee
Brown, two Lifetime Achievement Award winners put people plane
stores, Connecticut flew Cal State Fullerton. cross-country flight
got wear compression gear flight others not,
landed California training bout put back plane, went back stores
think another training bout got back there. lot data
came paper, one things clear compression group
effective handling blood related coagulation issues associated
long flights particularly athletic performance. that’s actually sneaky little Insider trick
use lot people, particularly athletes traveling, just wear
compression gear plane. talked sort rung study
mind another effective strategy, compression gear general, well
particularly plane, basically tighter can get better, without obviously
making hands purple uncomfortable things like that, doesn't
overly tight. Anything will work probably help. also personally,
anytime, taking

01:08:27 Tool: Acute Soreness, Massage, Temperature

flight like much can just feel little better get there.
methods can use alleviate acute soreness? Well, continue
theme, saying okay, use sort pressure manipulation
enhance recovery. compression one strategy, can also use things like compression
boots garments, nomadic devices will know, pump uh air outside
compress back forth. number devices will this. can


also use physical hand, massage body work they're, really
working best. can tell mechanisms effectively moving fluid
tissue, well potentially enhancing blood flow, increasing capitalization
going get nutrients waste products out. can kind pick
choose based upon budget preferences availability timing, things like that,
effective strategies outside really next largest category, now
thermal uh, far discussion, mentioned cold water, Immersion
talked hypertrophy section not want immediately: post
exercise, getting cold water ice bath trying grow muscle
mass. said that, good evidence showing cold water immersion
specifically effective reducing muscle soreness. fair consideration it’s
classic example no free passes physiology. Nothing always good
always bad. It’s always willing give versus willing
get case like cold water immersion? may thinking yeah. might want
hypertrophic adaptations, phase training,
actually trying push towards optimization moment, rather long-term
adaptation, ice bath might great choice. addition, fall scenario
like Natasha - realize like just unbelievably sore - might cost three
four five six days training. might worth accelerate recovery
process couple days don't miss much training. it’s just it’s
algorithm, it’s equation. looking season trying compete
just done way way much exercise, really significant pain.
probably willing give small percentage eventual muscle growth
single session get pain cold strategies. Cold water immersion clearly
best approach rather cold air tactics. cold shower probably
not enough here. really want either moderately cold. maybe 40 50
degree, water probably north 15 minutes can sub 40 little maybe
five minutes get fact number studies um.
sort summarizing bunch kind one rather going Point
point. numbers just threw uh, assuming um uh Fahrenheit um,
seem seem really cold right uncomfortably cold. Absolutely always recommend
people ease protocol overall not immediately go 35 degree uh
cold water, never done uh. said, people comfortable
uncomfortable, always answer question: cold exactly?
agree very, cold much really really want get out,
able stay safely? Whatever value happens be, absolutely


need safe. said that, actually, xbt Retreats, put dozens, not
hundreds people point, uh immediately sub 35 degree water first time
ever done. know three minutes multiple rounds session, can handle it.
don't need go crazy. don't want kind play game right,
want really really cold short amount time, want like kind
cold longer amount time? really mistake can make
something like know, 65 degree water people not comfortable
know five ten minutes. It’s just not going be. It’s probably not going
effective. like man 35 is, absolutely crazy want 55 degree, water
literature area. it’s going say need probably
somewhere, almost really north 10 minutes, will actually show need
like well north 20 30 minutes. money rather go really really
cold get done five minutes, um personal preference one. can also
make little bit easier yourself. not nearly much evidence,
contrast. Stuff uh, go cold, hot sort back forth.
no really good rules terms much go, many rounds, long
cold long hot couple studies obviously
studies use numbers, doesn't mean tested See optimal,
big difference, can really just kind play feel hot good
Recovery. just careful going put blood flow
area, may walk additional acute swelling isn't going
put greater pressure there. kind play that. personally really like
hot Recovery. will feel - maybe not great moment, next day tend feel
really really good. addition, wake next morning really really hurting
super stiff, hot bath will help um quite bit, can play
protocols. Again, don't

01:14:21 Cold & Heat Contrast, Cold Shower vs. Immersion, Sauna & Fertility

nice absolutely no requirement so. just option interested
studies Dr Susanna soberg sure yeah not directly aimed alleviating soreness
recovery, increasing thermal capacity storage uh Brown adipose
tissue, not blubbery fat stuff around clavicles around heart help
generate body, heat rest metabolism on, numbers um
come not tested possible derivations just like


breathing. five minute sessions, knows? Maybe minute
equally effective. just constraints sorts studies, values
come with, seem good thresholds making sure
adaptation response triggered heat cold. ends 57 minutes per week,
total uncomfortable safe heat case sauna, can one session
breaking couple sessions day different days, 11
minutes per week. cold either one single session multiple sessions, one
um one break know multiple days one day
one. know hour sauna 11 minutes colder vice versa,
although seems little bit extreme, especially uninitiated.
numbers studied. point out, not lot really thorough
studies examining different cold protocols according temperature time requirements.
bit subjective, feel required establish routine, actually say
another time re-emphasize something. talked beginning
conversation, pain not defined outcome. It’s heavily influenced
perception, so, don't feel like work you, won't work. feel like
work fantastic, so. It’s challenging field get really objective data
always going little bit subjective nature. things, can tell
anecdotally: used hot cold contrast long time athletes. love
don't care everything between. it’s one things never
mandate it. course, can't mandate anything anyone work with, never
know like hey. interested great struggling area? want try this?
liked great struggling area, tried it. didn't love it.
Okay, fine, not find routes, will get lot ways enhance
recovery um. one hasn't even really come stopping problem
first place, not just treating symptoms, first line defense,
really need go back figure it’s happening begin with, Solution,
just different acute symptom management tactics. One final point uh,
deliberate, cold exposure. think worth mentioning one reasons shower
effective, not nearly effective cold water, immersion immersion ice
neck simply reason stated before, showers not
going get cold not going get know sub 40s. Also cold
showers haven't really studied much have, not nearly much
immersion people always ask just think challenges studying cold water
exposure shower, can't really control mango? much body
covered, whether not head stays different size bodies, Etc? Whereas


people come laboratory, can get cold large, know neck
is. know chin can make sure people's arms um legs
underneath, cold shower sure can make everyone face away toward
shower, it’s really tricky um variations described. said,
agree one wants use deliberate cold exposure, cold shower better
nothing cold immersion circulating, cold water ice bath better um
cold shower yeah? actually say looking recovery muscle soreness,
say cold shower, probably little, not going able
get enough cold water onto muscle, besides, basically head, maybe
try cold bath least get surface area coverage, yeah want
use cold shower awesome reasons cold shower. That’s totally great.
trying use recover low back glutes sore training
good way, it’s probably not going much immersion there.
actually also hit sneaky point, is, can't get water super cold, just
make water move. Jets stuff can turn anyone tried
like. Okay, can 40 degree. Bath awesome, try 60, water
moving right, break thermal layer. Normally little thin layer
water heating up. break up. It’s whole new world, yeah, absolutely
still cold. Water actually weaker way go correct can make
face stoic, make body circulate water around long
this. Maybe just one point heat uh: certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry,
sauna, steam saunas. Excuse me, jacuzzis can work pretty well yep um uh males.
looking conceive 60 days following uh uh following sauna um, hot tub realize
approaches severely limit number motile sperm um
substantially. people not trying conceive uh. Don'T think works
reliably enough, use form contraception yeah, people
trying conceive. really detrimental sperm Health right reason
people bring ice pack put groin near groin go
um, hard hot tub sauna. getting fine points,
um crude points, will pun intended, um, idea wouldn't want
anyone approach techniques compromise life goals, certainly not
allowed anywhere near things. uh, stage Life, just say
Natasha put x hanging Laird. reasons, like you're, not
going you're, not going none stuff, just wait right heat um heat


sperm relationship it’s not one that’s positive sperm


01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques

ways combine various types stimuli described inducing
recovery? talked breathing based tools which, adjust indeed
adjust oxygen carbon dioxide ratios Etc. guessing major effect
recovery going neural. It’s going deliberate, calm nervous system,
sympathetic, based uh, mentioned, yeah definitely, talked
movement based touch-based approaches. Um, will uh movement
circulate, certainly will circulate blood, also will generate contractions muscles yep
right, maybe, if, indeed again, still speculates you, indeed soreness
due excessive stretch swelling stretch, ends muscles
make sense movement touch thermal, ways combine
um effective maybe even synergistic yeah. suppose throw uh
compression garments put Pneumatic compression device sit sauna.
regulate breath like fine. Quite honestly, though,
probably don't need maximize them. joking. probably go
light swim regulating breathing cold water. get compression
cold, water good spot, certainly that. reality
is. generally look physical approach holistic approach breath
work. Basically, want breath something else knock two things
good spot, breath thermal stress, just
controlling unregulation stuff. also remember ice stressor
actually show data second actually can enhance
systemic recovery, although won't happen acute minutes. fact, it’s going
take least 30 60 minutes eventually see rebound effect, acutely it’s
going make actually sympathetic, going direction. can
opposite can actually drive up. it’s little bit dependent upon
respond, time day you're, using general, guess combining
need um, depending available. perhaps don't
sauna, can take hot bath great. Maybe percussion device
tool can use that. don't sauna amazing. don't ice bath


things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

science [Music]


immediately need able recover make sure causes changes brains
thing happens here. need really sharp high inflammatory response
then, not meet immediate recovery period, signal won't
maximize results. mean can actually couple things? Number
one actually listening slow, paced, music evidence suggest fast-paced music
may slow recovery slow pace actually enhance it. just change
know maximum get get going music workout
slower, lower Cadence will help kick start idea similar note. can also
use call regulation breathing. conjunction one
other, whichever you, personal favorite method somewhere
three ten minutes finishing training session. Laying like
position, certainly Lotus position, think laying back
generally effective personal preference there, no science, like items
covered getting dark quiet sort area Then, just breathing nose
structured, Cadence, lot different things. can try easy example. just
box breathing can imagine box four squares. going
inhale somewhere between, like three eight seconds whatever number
choose, keep tempo, say chose five second inhale,
that’s going take vertically horizontally box five second hold
five second exhale five second hold, just need repeat
time domain. Now typically honestly don't use timer you'll, actually notice. lot
people will like fall asleep get really close falling asleep period. can
triangle version that, inhale, hold exhale go right back
inhale bunch different tricks. can try here, need play around
see actually works best you. Um 10 minutes probably better, can just
least give three that'll work, really really resistant, can actually that. Just
shower, going finish workout get shower again, just close
eyes shower, give three minutes focused relaxation breathing will
accelerate recovery process. love particularly love laboratory
works stress respiration, okay, breathing interactions two
just mention result just accepted publication, time day.
uh. Thank you. Uh beautiful work uh, not directly, although took
place lab, know, it’s students doctors um, Dr Melise uh, balbon
uh lab. It’s phenomenal researcher showed short period five minutes
box breathing exactly type described cyclic sign two inhales, followed
extended exhale lungs empty. Ideally, inhales done nose.


exhales done. Uh mouth, although done nose, um
mouth matter, probably nose. Nose inhale, inhale mouth exhale
um uh inhales, nose exhale nose. Cyclic sighing,
refer done five minutes, produce significant decreases resting
heart rate. time will increase things like heart rate, variability
forth. Um provided extended exhales. seems like calming response,
reduction overall stress occurs. thing really sends things
direction something like cyclic hyperventilation. sure observed um
interestingly uh, people just five minutes meditation which,
which, course, breathing just allowing breathing progress.
However, happens moment, um moments across five minutes uh.
reductions sorts markers stress described not significant
breathing. love Brock's breathing tool, post, workout, um
Alternatives too, just mentioned, think people greatly underestimate
potency breathing shifting one's nervous system function away stress one
wants toward alertness stress. actually couple questions
sure. think audience appreciate uh. long boxes? just
user selected great question, use carbon dioxide tolerance test amazing order
people determine long different sides Box be, cover
carbon dioxide tolerance tests. previous episode, can provide link clip um
show, note captions, but, point out, involves long extended exhale lungs,
empty um and, course, people sit lungs empty, accurately
Faithfully say report long took empty lungs. use
gauge. Typically, takes, people go lungs empty 20 seconds less, believe
go back paper look, believe duration sides
boxes were, somewhere um two three seconds,
CO2 discard time anywhere uh 20 seconds 40 45 seconds, use it.
sides box, believe, four six seconds people
longer discard Arrow period minute more. used
box duration inhale, hold exhale, hold duration somewhere between. believe
[ Music, ], um, seven, maybe eight long 11 12 seconds yeah.
will get kind free diver types. can really this? really well
trained sort thing? don't quote exactly numbers,
approximate. line exactly done. believe it’s it’s going
close within seconds non-important Distinction. it’s going close enough,
that’s great, uh. took six weeks. study done


period month swapped new pattern breathing um,
condition meditation condition - done natural world, say, um
wearing whoop bands. getting heart rate, heart rate, variability, sleep,
data, subjective data mood Etc. lot measures, um
100 subjects wild life um tried best track life, stress
events exercise, things like harder control outside laboratory.
Really results speak exactly exactly describing here,
deliberate respiration involves controlled holds exhales really dramatic
immediate impact reducing levels stress. That’s wonderful! not surprised
findings really interesting that, mentioned
exhalation portion primarily responsible regulation that’s actually goes
back previous endurance conversation, general rest, non-altitude
increases Co2 primary driver ventilation, generally means
inhales associated uptick sympathetic State exhales associated
uptick parasympathetic State. generally, folks will things like exhale
finish exhale right perform high Precision, neurological tasks.
going say, aim Target shoot going Exhale fully almost
always execute movement end exhale, that’s
highest parasympathetic State lowest drive ventilation. say not surprised
guys found actually data point individuals, particularly
endurance. Training can get back Baseline heart rate going
correlated with. gets actual results training. Said take
bunch individuals put endurance training program,
measure quickly can get back Baseline workout general,
folks better going see greater improvements Performance
end say, four six eight week, training block little bit
causation correlation untie. think it’s enough say: hey
invest three case study five minutes. It’s going
enhance recovery, likelihood increasing results training, now
also additional benefits like able transition appropriately next
task, going work going see family whatever thing is, it’s it’s nice close to,
asked high, sympathetic State body, asked perform
stress. gave recovery now ready transition next thing
don't take exercise energy. will next

01:03:39 Tool: Alleviate Acute Soreness, Compression Clothing



task may may not want sympathetic Drive state. somebody sore
following workout, either locally sore muscle, group group muscles, maybe
legs chest torso maybe whole body sore sometimes case.
tools can Implement order accelerate the? want call
moving soreness, it’s really, know, alleviation soreness
bunch different processes. effective tools push back
soreness dissipate yeah? Absolutely. First all, it’s not lactate! That’s just really
important thing still hear people talk about. know sore 24 hours later
got thing get lactate there, talked metabolism,
uh conversation episode not cause fatigue it’s certainly not
cause soreness. not actionable tip there, just pet peeve mine. hear
people say get irritated can maybe end conversation um strategies,
tools, can do, can actually wear compression gear will help little
bit. decent amount evidence, suggesting, just you, know, put
tighter fitting clothes Leisure, wear compression gear. can
actually prevent little bit soreness occurring. case poor
Natasha - realize just done way way much went hung
bow hunting friend trained way hard, realize, oh, goodness,
going sore here. can immediately put compression gear weigh
really long possible. examples compression gear? seen
people plane high high socks um, mean anything wear
compression gear exercise. whether just know,
compression pants leggings tight fitting leggings uh, whether long sleeve
shirt, that’s like rash guard, wear know Jiu, Jitsu surfing, something
like that. long it’s tight fitting, doesn't much can wear.
suppose get socks, great, generally just tell leads them.
put long sleeve compression shirts wear training
long, compression, leggings that'd fine. Can people apply compression
um Garb training still get positive effects yeah? not seen
evidence suggest block adaptation. may case. not aware
studies happens, certainly know information suggests can
hands little bit Muscle Recovery. ideally one knows workout
trigger lot soreness yeah compression gear sort
offset that, local muscle groups working
Reason asked socks understanding. socks uh, compression


socks people plane it’s going shift patterns blood flow, not just
lower legs, body yeah you're, probably going want focus
actual exercising tissue, though, Actually, that’s really good question. don't know
answer whether not upper body workout lower body compression
gear. actually help that’s great question. may done. don't know,
don't know answer general, just tell people like where, whole
thing much can um, actually not concerned wearing
workout. something put afterwards even wear just little bit
compression day. Um actually really fun study. Uh. collaborated
um Bill Kramer who's. Uh, know, Sports scientist Year award. bill Cramer
award, gives indication uh University Connecticut, well Lee
Brown, two Lifetime Achievement Award winners put people plane
stores, Connecticut flew Cal State Fullerton. cross-country flight
got wear compression gear flight others not,
landed California training bout put back plane, went back stores
think another training bout got back there. lot data
came paper, one things clear compression group
effective handling blood related coagulation issues associated
long flights particularly athletic performance. that’s actually sneaky little Insider trick
use lot people, particularly athletes traveling, just wear
compression gear plane. talked sort rung study
mind another effective strategy, compression gear general, well
particularly plane, basically tighter can get better, without obviously
making hands purple uncomfortable things like that, doesn't
overly tight. Anything will work probably help. also personally,
anytime, taking

01:08:27 Tool: Acute Soreness, Massage, Temperature

flight like much can just feel little better get there.
methods can use alleviate acute soreness? Well, continue
theme, saying okay, use sort pressure manipulation
enhance recovery. compression one strategy, can also use things like compression
boots garments, nomadic devices will know, pump uh air outside
compress back forth. number devices will this. can


also use physical hand, massage body work they're, really
working best. can tell mechanisms effectively moving fluid
tissue, well potentially enhancing blood flow, increasing capitalization
going get nutrients waste products out. can kind pick
choose based upon budget preferences availability timing, things like that,
effective strategies outside really next largest category, now
thermal uh, far discussion, mentioned cold water, Immersion
talked hypertrophy section not want immediately: post
exercise, getting cold water ice bath trying grow muscle
mass. said that, good evidence showing cold water immersion
specifically effective reducing muscle soreness. fair consideration it’s
classic example no free passes physiology. Nothing always good
always bad. It’s always willing give versus willing
get case like cold water immersion? may thinking yeah. might want
hypertrophic adaptations, phase training,
actually trying push towards optimization moment, rather long-term
adaptation, ice bath might great choice. addition, fall scenario
like Natasha - realize like just unbelievably sore - might cost three
four five six days training. might worth accelerate recovery
process couple days don't miss much training. it’s just it’s
algorithm, it’s equation. looking season trying compete
just done way way much exercise, really significant pain.
probably willing give small percentage eventual muscle growth
single session get pain cold strategies. Cold water immersion clearly
best approach rather cold air tactics. cold shower probably
not enough here. really want either moderately cold. maybe 40 50
degree, water probably north 15 minutes can sub 40 little maybe
five minutes get fact number studies um.
sort summarizing bunch kind one rather going Point
point. numbers just threw uh, assuming um uh Fahrenheit um,
seem seem really cold right uncomfortably cold. Absolutely always recommend
people ease protocol overall not immediately go 35 degree uh
cold water, never done uh. said, people comfortable
uncomfortable, always answer question: cold exactly?
agree very, cold much really really want get out,
able stay safely? Whatever value happens be, absolutely


need safe. said that, actually, xbt Retreats, put dozens, not
hundreds people point, uh immediately sub 35 degree water first time
ever done. know three minutes multiple rounds session, can handle it.
don't need go crazy. don't want kind play game right,
want really really cold short amount time, want like kind
cold longer amount time? really mistake can make
something like know, 65 degree water people not comfortable
know five ten minutes. It’s just not going be. It’s probably not going
effective. like man 35 is, absolutely crazy want 55 degree, water
literature area. it’s going say need probably
somewhere, almost really north 10 minutes, will actually show need
like well north 20 30 minutes. money rather go really really
cold get done five minutes, um personal preference one. can also
make little bit easier yourself. not nearly much evidence,
contrast. Stuff uh, go cold, hot sort back forth.
no really good rules terms much go, many rounds, long
cold long hot couple studies obviously
studies use numbers, doesn't mean tested See optimal,
big difference, can really just kind play feel hot good
Recovery. just careful going put blood flow
area, may walk additional acute swelling isn't going
put greater pressure there. kind play that. personally really like
hot Recovery. will feel - maybe not great moment, next day tend feel
really really good. addition, wake next morning really really hurting
super stiff, hot bath will help um quite bit, can play
protocols. Again, don't

01:14:21 Cold & Heat Contrast, Cold Shower vs. Immersion, Sauna & Fertility

nice absolutely no requirement so. just option interested
studies Dr Susanna soberg sure yeah not directly aimed alleviating soreness
recovery, increasing thermal capacity storage uh Brown adipose
tissue, not blubbery fat stuff around clavicles around heart help
generate body, heat rest metabolism on, numbers um
come not tested possible derivations just like


breathing. five minute sessions, knows? Maybe minute
equally effective. just constraints sorts studies, values
come with, seem good thresholds making sure
adaptation response triggered heat cold. ends 57 minutes per week,
total uncomfortable safe heat case sauna, can one session
breaking couple sessions day different days, 11
minutes per week. cold either one single session multiple sessions, one
um one break know multiple days one day
one. know hour sauna 11 minutes colder vice versa,
although seems little bit extreme, especially uninitiated.
numbers studied. point out, not lot really thorough
studies examining different cold protocols according temperature time requirements.
bit subjective, feel required establish routine, actually say
another time re-emphasize something. talked beginning
conversation, pain not defined outcome. It’s heavily influenced
perception, so, don't feel like work you, won't work. feel like
work fantastic, so. It’s challenging field get really objective data
always going little bit subjective nature. things, can tell
anecdotally: used hot cold contrast long time athletes. love
don't care everything between. it’s one things never
mandate it. course, can't mandate anything anyone work with, never
know like hey. interested great struggling area? want try this?
liked great struggling area, tried it. didn't love it.
Okay, fine, not find routes, will get lot ways enhance
recovery um. one hasn't even really come stopping problem
first place, not just treating symptoms, first line defense,
really need go back figure it’s happening begin with, Solution,
just different acute symptom management tactics. One final point uh,
deliberate, cold exposure. think worth mentioning one reasons shower
effective, not nearly effective cold water, immersion immersion ice
neck simply reason stated before, showers not
going get cold not going get know sub 40s. Also cold
showers haven't really studied much have, not nearly much
immersion people always ask just think challenges studying cold water
exposure shower, can't really control mango? much body
covered, whether not head stays different size bodies, Etc? Whereas


people come laboratory, can get cold large, know neck
is. know chin can make sure people's arms um legs
underneath, cold shower sure can make everyone face away toward
shower, it’s really tricky um variations described. said,
agree one wants use deliberate cold exposure, cold shower better
nothing cold immersion circulating, cold water ice bath better um
cold shower yeah? actually say looking recovery muscle soreness,
say cold shower, probably little, not going able
get enough cold water onto muscle, besides, basically head, maybe
try cold bath least get surface area coverage, yeah want
use cold shower awesome reasons cold shower. That’s totally great.
trying use recover low back glutes sore training
good way, it’s probably not going much immersion there.
actually also hit sneaky point, is, can't get water super cold, just
make water move. Jets stuff can turn anyone tried
like. Okay, can 40 degree. Bath awesome, try 60, water
moving right, break thermal layer. Normally little thin layer
water heating up. break up. It’s whole new world, yeah, absolutely
still cold. Water actually weaker way go correct can make
face stoic, make body circulate water around long
this. Maybe just one point heat uh: certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry,
sauna, steam saunas. Excuse me, jacuzzis can work pretty well yep um uh males.
looking conceive 60 days following uh uh following sauna um, hot tub realize
approaches severely limit number motile sperm um
substantially. people not trying conceive uh. Don'T think works
reliably enough, use form contraception yeah, people
trying conceive. really detrimental sperm Health right reason
people bring ice pack put groin near groin go
um, hard hot tub sauna. getting fine points,
um crude points, will pun intended, um, idea wouldn't want
anyone approach techniques compromise life goals, certainly not
allowed anywhere near things. uh, stage Life, just say
Natasha put x hanging Laird. reasons, like you're, not
going you're, not going none stuff, just wait right heat um heat


sperm relationship it’s not one that’s positive sperm


01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques

ways combine various types stimuli described inducing
recovery? talked breathing based tools which, adjust indeed
adjust oxygen carbon dioxide ratios Etc. guessing major effect
recovery going neural. It’s going deliberate, calm nervous system,
sympathetic, based uh, mentioned, yeah definitely, talked
movement based touch-based approaches. Um, will uh movement
circulate, certainly will circulate blood, also will generate contractions muscles yep
right, maybe, if, indeed again, still speculates you, indeed soreness
due excessive stretch swelling stretch, ends muscles
make sense movement touch thermal, ways combine
um effective maybe even synergistic yeah. suppose throw uh
compression garments put Pneumatic compression device sit sauna.
regulate breath like fine. Quite honestly, though,
probably don't need maximize them. joking. probably go
light swim regulating breathing cold water. get compression
cold, water good spot, certainly that. reality
is. generally look physical approach holistic approach breath
work. Basically, want breath something else knock two things
good spot, breath thermal stress, just
controlling unregulation stuff. also remember ice stressor
actually show data second actually can enhance
systemic recovery, although won't happen acute minutes. fact, it’s going
take least 30 60 minutes eventually see rebound effect, acutely it’s
going make actually sympathetic, going direction. can
opposite can actually drive up. it’s little bit dependent upon
respond, time day you're, using general, guess combining
need um, depending available. perhaps don't
sauna, can take hot bath great. Maybe percussion device
tool can use that. don't sauna amazing. don't ice bath


things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food

exhales done. Uh mouth, although done nose, um
mouth matter, probably nose. Nose inhale, inhale mouth exhale
um uh inhales, nose exhale nose. Cyclic sighing,
refer done five minutes, produce significant decreases resting
heart rate. time will increase things like heart rate, variability
forth. Um provided extended exhales. seems like calming response,
reduction overall stress occurs. thing really sends things
direction something like cyclic hyperventilation. sure observed um
interestingly uh, people just five minutes meditation which,
which, course, breathing just allowing breathing progress.
However, happens moment, um moments across five minutes uh.
reductions sorts markers stress described not significant
breathing. love Brock's breathing tool, post, workout, um
Alternatives too, just mentioned, think people greatly underestimate
potency breathing shifting one's nervous system function away stress one
wants toward alertness stress. actually couple questions
sure. think audience appreciate uh. long boxes? just
user selected great question, use carbon dioxide tolerance test amazing order
people determine long different sides Box be, cover
carbon dioxide tolerance tests. previous episode, can provide link clip um
show, note captions, but, point out, involves long extended exhale lungs,
empty um and, course, people sit lungs empty, accurately
Faithfully say report long took empty lungs. use
gauge. Typically, takes, people go lungs empty 20 seconds less, believe
go back paper look, believe duration sides
boxes were, somewhere um two three seconds,
CO2 discard time anywhere uh 20 seconds 40 45 seconds, use it.
sides box, believe, four six seconds people
longer discard Arrow period minute more. used
box duration inhale, hold exhale, hold duration somewhere between. believe
[ Music, ], um, seven, maybe eight long 11 12 seconds yeah.
will get kind free diver types. can really this? really well
trained sort thing? don't quote exactly numbers,
approximate. line exactly done. believe it’s it’s going
close within seconds non-important Distinction. it’s going close enough,
that’s great, uh. took six weeks. study done


period month swapped new pattern breathing um,
condition meditation condition - done natural world, say, um
wearing whoop bands. getting heart rate, heart rate, variability, sleep,
data, subjective data mood Etc. lot measures, um
100 subjects wild life um tried best track life, stress
events exercise, things like harder control outside laboratory.
Really results speak exactly exactly describing here,
deliberate respiration involves controlled holds exhales really dramatic
immediate impact reducing levels stress. That’s wonderful! not surprised
findings really interesting that, mentioned
exhalation portion primarily responsible regulation that’s actually goes
back previous endurance conversation, general rest, non-altitude
increases Co2 primary driver ventilation, generally means
inhales associated uptick sympathetic State exhales associated
uptick parasympathetic State. generally, folks will things like exhale
finish exhale right perform high Precision, neurological tasks.
going say, aim Target shoot going Exhale fully almost
always execute movement end exhale, that’s
highest parasympathetic State lowest drive ventilation. say not surprised
guys found actually data point individuals, particularly
endurance. Training can get back Baseline heart rate going
correlated with. gets actual results training. Said take
bunch individuals put endurance training program,
measure quickly can get back Baseline workout general,
folks better going see greater improvements Performance
end say, four six eight week, training block little bit
causation correlation untie. think it’s enough say: hey
invest three case study five minutes. It’s going
enhance recovery, likelihood increasing results training, now
also additional benefits like able transition appropriately next
task, going work going see family whatever thing is, it’s it’s nice close to,
asked high, sympathetic State body, asked perform
stress. gave recovery now ready transition next thing
don't take exercise energy. will next

01:03:39 Tool: Alleviate Acute Soreness, Compression Clothing



task may may not want sympathetic Drive state. somebody sore
following workout, either locally sore muscle, group group muscles, maybe
legs chest torso maybe whole body sore sometimes case.
tools can Implement order accelerate the? want call
moving soreness, it’s really, know, alleviation soreness
bunch different processes. effective tools push back
soreness dissipate yeah? Absolutely. First all, it’s not lactate! That’s just really
important thing still hear people talk about. know sore 24 hours later
got thing get lactate there, talked metabolism,
uh conversation episode not cause fatigue it’s certainly not
cause soreness. not actionable tip there, just pet peeve mine. hear
people say get irritated can maybe end conversation um strategies,
tools, can do, can actually wear compression gear will help little
bit. decent amount evidence, suggesting, just you, know, put
tighter fitting clothes Leisure, wear compression gear. can
actually prevent little bit soreness occurring. case poor
Natasha - realize just done way way much went hung
bow hunting friend trained way hard, realize, oh, goodness,
going sore here. can immediately put compression gear weigh
really long possible. examples compression gear? seen
people plane high high socks um, mean anything wear
compression gear exercise. whether just know,
compression pants leggings tight fitting leggings uh, whether long sleeve
shirt, that’s like rash guard, wear know Jiu, Jitsu surfing, something
like that. long it’s tight fitting, doesn't much can wear.
suppose get socks, great, generally just tell leads them.
put long sleeve compression shirts wear training
long, compression, leggings that'd fine. Can people apply compression
um Garb training still get positive effects yeah? not seen
evidence suggest block adaptation. may case. not aware
studies happens, certainly know information suggests can
hands little bit Muscle Recovery. ideally one knows workout
trigger lot soreness yeah compression gear sort
offset that, local muscle groups working
Reason asked socks understanding. socks uh, compression


socks people plane it’s going shift patterns blood flow, not just
lower legs, body yeah you're, probably going want focus
actual exercising tissue, though, Actually, that’s really good question. don't know
answer whether not upper body workout lower body compression
gear. actually help that’s great question. may done. don't know,
don't know answer general, just tell people like where, whole
thing much can um, actually not concerned wearing
workout. something put afterwards even wear just little bit
compression day. Um actually really fun study. Uh. collaborated
um Bill Kramer who's. Uh, know, Sports scientist Year award. bill Cramer
award, gives indication uh University Connecticut, well Lee
Brown, two Lifetime Achievement Award winners put people plane
stores, Connecticut flew Cal State Fullerton. cross-country flight
got wear compression gear flight others not,
landed California training bout put back plane, went back stores
think another training bout got back there. lot data
came paper, one things clear compression group
effective handling blood related coagulation issues associated
long flights particularly athletic performance. that’s actually sneaky little Insider trick
use lot people, particularly athletes traveling, just wear
compression gear plane. talked sort rung study
mind another effective strategy, compression gear general, well
particularly plane, basically tighter can get better, without obviously
making hands purple uncomfortable things like that, doesn't
overly tight. Anything will work probably help. also personally,
anytime, taking

01:08:27 Tool: Acute Soreness, Massage, Temperature

flight like much can just feel little better get there.
methods can use alleviate acute soreness? Well, continue
theme, saying okay, use sort pressure manipulation
enhance recovery. compression one strategy, can also use things like compression
boots garments, nomadic devices will know, pump uh air outside
compress back forth. number devices will this. can


also use physical hand, massage body work they're, really
working best. can tell mechanisms effectively moving fluid
tissue, well potentially enhancing blood flow, increasing capitalization
going get nutrients waste products out. can kind pick
choose based upon budget preferences availability timing, things like that,
effective strategies outside really next largest category, now
thermal uh, far discussion, mentioned cold water, Immersion
talked hypertrophy section not want immediately: post
exercise, getting cold water ice bath trying grow muscle
mass. said that, good evidence showing cold water immersion
specifically effective reducing muscle soreness. fair consideration it’s
classic example no free passes physiology. Nothing always good
always bad. It’s always willing give versus willing
get case like cold water immersion? may thinking yeah. might want
hypertrophic adaptations, phase training,
actually trying push towards optimization moment, rather long-term
adaptation, ice bath might great choice. addition, fall scenario
like Natasha - realize like just unbelievably sore - might cost three
four five six days training. might worth accelerate recovery
process couple days don't miss much training. it’s just it’s
algorithm, it’s equation. looking season trying compete
just done way way much exercise, really significant pain.
probably willing give small percentage eventual muscle growth
single session get pain cold strategies. Cold water immersion clearly
best approach rather cold air tactics. cold shower probably
not enough here. really want either moderately cold. maybe 40 50
degree, water probably north 15 minutes can sub 40 little maybe
five minutes get fact number studies um.
sort summarizing bunch kind one rather going Point
point. numbers just threw uh, assuming um uh Fahrenheit um,
seem seem really cold right uncomfortably cold. Absolutely always recommend
people ease protocol overall not immediately go 35 degree uh
cold water, never done uh. said, people comfortable
uncomfortable, always answer question: cold exactly?
agree very, cold much really really want get out,
able stay safely? Whatever value happens be, absolutely


need safe. said that, actually, xbt Retreats, put dozens, not
hundreds people point, uh immediately sub 35 degree water first time
ever done. know three minutes multiple rounds session, can handle it.
don't need go crazy. don't want kind play game right,
want really really cold short amount time, want like kind
cold longer amount time? really mistake can make
something like know, 65 degree water people not comfortable
know five ten minutes. It’s just not going be. It’s probably not going
effective. like man 35 is, absolutely crazy want 55 degree, water
literature area. it’s going say need probably
somewhere, almost really north 10 minutes, will actually show need
like well north 20 30 minutes. money rather go really really
cold get done five minutes, um personal preference one. can also
make little bit easier yourself. not nearly much evidence,
contrast. Stuff uh, go cold, hot sort back forth.
no really good rules terms much go, many rounds, long
cold long hot couple studies obviously
studies use numbers, doesn't mean tested See optimal,
big difference, can really just kind play feel hot good
Recovery. just careful going put blood flow
area, may walk additional acute swelling isn't going
put greater pressure there. kind play that. personally really like
hot Recovery. will feel - maybe not great moment, next day tend feel
really really good. addition, wake next morning really really hurting
super stiff, hot bath will help um quite bit, can play
protocols. Again, don't

01:14:21 Cold & Heat Contrast, Cold Shower vs. Immersion, Sauna & Fertility

nice absolutely no requirement so. just option interested
studies Dr Susanna soberg sure yeah not directly aimed alleviating soreness
recovery, increasing thermal capacity storage uh Brown adipose
tissue, not blubbery fat stuff around clavicles around heart help
generate body, heat rest metabolism on, numbers um
come not tested possible derivations just like


breathing. five minute sessions, knows? Maybe minute
equally effective. just constraints sorts studies, values
come with, seem good thresholds making sure
adaptation response triggered heat cold. ends 57 minutes per week,
total uncomfortable safe heat case sauna, can one session
breaking couple sessions day different days, 11
minutes per week. cold either one single session multiple sessions, one
um one break know multiple days one day
one. know hour sauna 11 minutes colder vice versa,
although seems little bit extreme, especially uninitiated.
numbers studied. point out, not lot really thorough
studies examining different cold protocols according temperature time requirements.
bit subjective, feel required establish routine, actually say
another time re-emphasize something. talked beginning
conversation, pain not defined outcome. It’s heavily influenced
perception, so, don't feel like work you, won't work. feel like
work fantastic, so. It’s challenging field get really objective data
always going little bit subjective nature. things, can tell
anecdotally: used hot cold contrast long time athletes. love
don't care everything between. it’s one things never
mandate it. course, can't mandate anything anyone work with, never
know like hey. interested great struggling area? want try this?
liked great struggling area, tried it. didn't love it.
Okay, fine, not find routes, will get lot ways enhance
recovery um. one hasn't even really come stopping problem
first place, not just treating symptoms, first line defense,
really need go back figure it’s happening begin with, Solution,
just different acute symptom management tactics. One final point uh,
deliberate, cold exposure. think worth mentioning one reasons shower
effective, not nearly effective cold water, immersion immersion ice
neck simply reason stated before, showers not
going get cold not going get know sub 40s. Also cold
showers haven't really studied much have, not nearly much
immersion people always ask just think challenges studying cold water
exposure shower, can't really control mango? much body
covered, whether not head stays different size bodies, Etc? Whereas


people come laboratory, can get cold large, know neck
is. know chin can make sure people's arms um legs
underneath, cold shower sure can make everyone face away toward
shower, it’s really tricky um variations described. said,
agree one wants use deliberate cold exposure, cold shower better
nothing cold immersion circulating, cold water ice bath better um
cold shower yeah? actually say looking recovery muscle soreness,
say cold shower, probably little, not going able
get enough cold water onto muscle, besides, basically head, maybe
try cold bath least get surface area coverage, yeah want
use cold shower awesome reasons cold shower. That’s totally great.
trying use recover low back glutes sore training
good way, it’s probably not going much immersion there.
actually also hit sneaky point, is, can't get water super cold, just
make water move. Jets stuff can turn anyone tried
like. Okay, can 40 degree. Bath awesome, try 60, water
moving right, break thermal layer. Normally little thin layer
water heating up. break up. It’s whole new world, yeah, absolutely
still cold. Water actually weaker way go correct can make
face stoic, make body circulate water around long
this. Maybe just one point heat uh: certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry,
sauna, steam saunas. Excuse me, jacuzzis can work pretty well yep um uh males.
looking conceive 60 days following uh uh following sauna um, hot tub realize
approaches severely limit number motile sperm um
substantially. people not trying conceive uh. Don'T think works
reliably enough, use form contraception yeah, people
trying conceive. really detrimental sperm Health right reason
people bring ice pack put groin near groin go
um, hard hot tub sauna. getting fine points,
um crude points, will pun intended, um, idea wouldn't want
anyone approach techniques compromise life goals, certainly not
allowed anywhere near things. uh, stage Life, just say
Natasha put x hanging Laird. reasons, like you're, not
going you're, not going none stuff, just wait right heat um heat


sperm relationship it’s not one that’s positive sperm


01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques

ways combine various types stimuli described inducing
recovery? talked breathing based tools which, adjust indeed
adjust oxygen carbon dioxide ratios Etc. guessing major effect
recovery going neural. It’s going deliberate, calm nervous system,
sympathetic, based uh, mentioned, yeah definitely, talked
movement based touch-based approaches. Um, will uh movement
circulate, certainly will circulate blood, also will generate contractions muscles yep
right, maybe, if, indeed again, still speculates you, indeed soreness
due excessive stretch swelling stretch, ends muscles
make sense movement touch thermal, ways combine
um effective maybe even synergistic yeah. suppose throw uh
compression garments put Pneumatic compression device sit sauna.
regulate breath like fine. Quite honestly, though,
probably don't need maximize them. joking. probably go
light swim regulating breathing cold water. get compression
cold, water good spot, certainly that. reality
is. generally look physical approach holistic approach breath
work. Basically, want breath something else knock two things
good spot, breath thermal stress, just
controlling unregulation stuff. also remember ice stressor
actually show data second actually can enhance
systemic recovery, although won't happen acute minutes. fact, it’s going
take least 30 60 minutes eventually see rebound effect, acutely it’s
going make actually sympathetic, going direction. can
opposite can actually drive up. it’s little bit dependent upon
respond, time day you're, using general, guess combining
need um, depending available. perhaps don't
sauna, can take hot bath great. Maybe percussion device
tool can use that. don't sauna amazing. don't ice bath


things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

period month swapped new pattern breathing um,
condition meditation condition - done natural world, say, um
wearing whoop bands. getting heart rate, heart rate, variability, sleep,
data, subjective data mood Etc. lot measures, um
100 subjects wild life um tried best track life, stress
events exercise, things like harder control outside laboratory.
Really results speak exactly exactly describing here,
deliberate respiration involves controlled holds exhales really dramatic
immediate impact reducing levels stress. That’s wonderful! not surprised
findings really interesting that, mentioned
exhalation portion primarily responsible regulation that’s actually goes
back previous endurance conversation, general rest, non-altitude
increases Co2 primary driver ventilation, generally means
inhales associated uptick sympathetic State exhales associated
uptick parasympathetic State. generally, folks will things like exhale
finish exhale right perform high Precision, neurological tasks.
going say, aim Target shoot going Exhale fully almost
always execute movement end exhale, that’s
highest parasympathetic State lowest drive ventilation. say not surprised
guys found actually data point individuals, particularly
endurance. Training can get back Baseline heart rate going
correlated with. gets actual results training. Said take
bunch individuals put endurance training program,
measure quickly can get back Baseline workout general,
folks better going see greater improvements Performance
end say, four six eight week, training block little bit
causation correlation untie. think it’s enough say: hey
invest three case study five minutes. It’s going
enhance recovery, likelihood increasing results training, now
also additional benefits like able transition appropriately next
task, going work going see family whatever thing is, it’s it’s nice close to,
asked high, sympathetic State body, asked perform
stress. gave recovery now ready transition next thing
don't take exercise energy. will next

01:03:39 Tool: Alleviate Acute Soreness, Compression Clothing



task may may not want sympathetic Drive state. somebody sore
following workout, either locally sore muscle, group group muscles, maybe
legs chest torso maybe whole body sore sometimes case.
tools can Implement order accelerate the? want call
moving soreness, it’s really, know, alleviation soreness
bunch different processes. effective tools push back
soreness dissipate yeah? Absolutely. First all, it’s not lactate! That’s just really
important thing still hear people talk about. know sore 24 hours later
got thing get lactate there, talked metabolism,
uh conversation episode not cause fatigue it’s certainly not
cause soreness. not actionable tip there, just pet peeve mine. hear
people say get irritated can maybe end conversation um strategies,
tools, can do, can actually wear compression gear will help little
bit. decent amount evidence, suggesting, just you, know, put
tighter fitting clothes Leisure, wear compression gear. can
actually prevent little bit soreness occurring. case poor
Natasha - realize just done way way much went hung
bow hunting friend trained way hard, realize, oh, goodness,
going sore here. can immediately put compression gear weigh
really long possible. examples compression gear? seen
people plane high high socks um, mean anything wear
compression gear exercise. whether just know,
compression pants leggings tight fitting leggings uh, whether long sleeve
shirt, that’s like rash guard, wear know Jiu, Jitsu surfing, something
like that. long it’s tight fitting, doesn't much can wear.
suppose get socks, great, generally just tell leads them.
put long sleeve compression shirts wear training
long, compression, leggings that'd fine. Can people apply compression
um Garb training still get positive effects yeah? not seen
evidence suggest block adaptation. may case. not aware
studies happens, certainly know information suggests can
hands little bit Muscle Recovery. ideally one knows workout
trigger lot soreness yeah compression gear sort
offset that, local muscle groups working
Reason asked socks understanding. socks uh, compression


socks people plane it’s going shift patterns blood flow, not just
lower legs, body yeah you're, probably going want focus
actual exercising tissue, though, Actually, that’s really good question. don't know
answer whether not upper body workout lower body compression
gear. actually help that’s great question. may done. don't know,
don't know answer general, just tell people like where, whole
thing much can um, actually not concerned wearing
workout. something put afterwards even wear just little bit
compression day. Um actually really fun study. Uh. collaborated
um Bill Kramer who's. Uh, know, Sports scientist Year award. bill Cramer
award, gives indication uh University Connecticut, well Lee
Brown, two Lifetime Achievement Award winners put people plane
stores, Connecticut flew Cal State Fullerton. cross-country flight
got wear compression gear flight others not,
landed California training bout put back plane, went back stores
think another training bout got back there. lot data
came paper, one things clear compression group
effective handling blood related coagulation issues associated
long flights particularly athletic performance. that’s actually sneaky little Insider trick
use lot people, particularly athletes traveling, just wear
compression gear plane. talked sort rung study
mind another effective strategy, compression gear general, well
particularly plane, basically tighter can get better, without obviously
making hands purple uncomfortable things like that, doesn't
overly tight. Anything will work probably help. also personally,
anytime, taking

01:08:27 Tool: Acute Soreness, Massage, Temperature

flight like much can just feel little better get there.
methods can use alleviate acute soreness? Well, continue
theme, saying okay, use sort pressure manipulation
enhance recovery. compression one strategy, can also use things like compression
boots garments, nomadic devices will know, pump uh air outside
compress back forth. number devices will this. can


also use physical hand, massage body work they're, really
working best. can tell mechanisms effectively moving fluid
tissue, well potentially enhancing blood flow, increasing capitalization
going get nutrients waste products out. can kind pick
choose based upon budget preferences availability timing, things like that,
effective strategies outside really next largest category, now
thermal uh, far discussion, mentioned cold water, Immersion
talked hypertrophy section not want immediately: post
exercise, getting cold water ice bath trying grow muscle
mass. said that, good evidence showing cold water immersion
specifically effective reducing muscle soreness. fair consideration it’s
classic example no free passes physiology. Nothing always good
always bad. It’s always willing give versus willing
get case like cold water immersion? may thinking yeah. might want
hypertrophic adaptations, phase training,
actually trying push towards optimization moment, rather long-term
adaptation, ice bath might great choice. addition, fall scenario
like Natasha - realize like just unbelievably sore - might cost three
four five six days training. might worth accelerate recovery
process couple days don't miss much training. it’s just it’s
algorithm, it’s equation. looking season trying compete
just done way way much exercise, really significant pain.
probably willing give small percentage eventual muscle growth
single session get pain cold strategies. Cold water immersion clearly
best approach rather cold air tactics. cold shower probably
not enough here. really want either moderately cold. maybe 40 50
degree, water probably north 15 minutes can sub 40 little maybe
five minutes get fact number studies um.
sort summarizing bunch kind one rather going Point
point. numbers just threw uh, assuming um uh Fahrenheit um,
seem seem really cold right uncomfortably cold. Absolutely always recommend
people ease protocol overall not immediately go 35 degree uh
cold water, never done uh. said, people comfortable
uncomfortable, always answer question: cold exactly?
agree very, cold much really really want get out,
able stay safely? Whatever value happens be, absolutely


need safe. said that, actually, xbt Retreats, put dozens, not
hundreds people point, uh immediately sub 35 degree water first time
ever done. know three minutes multiple rounds session, can handle it.
don't need go crazy. don't want kind play game right,
want really really cold short amount time, want like kind
cold longer amount time? really mistake can make
something like know, 65 degree water people not comfortable
know five ten minutes. It’s just not going be. It’s probably not going
effective. like man 35 is, absolutely crazy want 55 degree, water
literature area. it’s going say need probably
somewhere, almost really north 10 minutes, will actually show need
like well north 20 30 minutes. money rather go really really
cold get done five minutes, um personal preference one. can also
make little bit easier yourself. not nearly much evidence,
contrast. Stuff uh, go cold, hot sort back forth.
no really good rules terms much go, many rounds, long
cold long hot couple studies obviously
studies use numbers, doesn't mean tested See optimal,
big difference, can really just kind play feel hot good
Recovery. just careful going put blood flow
area, may walk additional acute swelling isn't going
put greater pressure there. kind play that. personally really like
hot Recovery. will feel - maybe not great moment, next day tend feel
really really good. addition, wake next morning really really hurting
super stiff, hot bath will help um quite bit, can play
protocols. Again, don't

01:14:21 Cold & Heat Contrast, Cold Shower vs. Immersion, Sauna & Fertility

nice absolutely no requirement so. just option interested
studies Dr Susanna soberg sure yeah not directly aimed alleviating soreness
recovery, increasing thermal capacity storage uh Brown adipose
tissue, not blubbery fat stuff around clavicles around heart help
generate body, heat rest metabolism on, numbers um
come not tested possible derivations just like


breathing. five minute sessions, knows? Maybe minute
equally effective. just constraints sorts studies, values
come with, seem good thresholds making sure
adaptation response triggered heat cold. ends 57 minutes per week,
total uncomfortable safe heat case sauna, can one session
breaking couple sessions day different days, 11
minutes per week. cold either one single session multiple sessions, one
um one break know multiple days one day
one. know hour sauna 11 minutes colder vice versa,
although seems little bit extreme, especially uninitiated.
numbers studied. point out, not lot really thorough
studies examining different cold protocols according temperature time requirements.
bit subjective, feel required establish routine, actually say
another time re-emphasize something. talked beginning
conversation, pain not defined outcome. It’s heavily influenced
perception, so, don't feel like work you, won't work. feel like
work fantastic, so. It’s challenging field get really objective data
always going little bit subjective nature. things, can tell
anecdotally: used hot cold contrast long time athletes. love
don't care everything between. it’s one things never
mandate it. course, can't mandate anything anyone work with, never
know like hey. interested great struggling area? want try this?
liked great struggling area, tried it. didn't love it.
Okay, fine, not find routes, will get lot ways enhance
recovery um. one hasn't even really come stopping problem
first place, not just treating symptoms, first line defense,
really need go back figure it’s happening begin with, Solution,
just different acute symptom management tactics. One final point uh,
deliberate, cold exposure. think worth mentioning one reasons shower
effective, not nearly effective cold water, immersion immersion ice
neck simply reason stated before, showers not
going get cold not going get know sub 40s. Also cold
showers haven't really studied much have, not nearly much
immersion people always ask just think challenges studying cold water
exposure shower, can't really control mango? much body
covered, whether not head stays different size bodies, Etc? Whereas


people come laboratory, can get cold large, know neck
is. know chin can make sure people's arms um legs
underneath, cold shower sure can make everyone face away toward
shower, it’s really tricky um variations described. said,
agree one wants use deliberate cold exposure, cold shower better
nothing cold immersion circulating, cold water ice bath better um
cold shower yeah? actually say looking recovery muscle soreness,
say cold shower, probably little, not going able
get enough cold water onto muscle, besides, basically head, maybe
try cold bath least get surface area coverage, yeah want
use cold shower awesome reasons cold shower. That’s totally great.
trying use recover low back glutes sore training
good way, it’s probably not going much immersion there.
actually also hit sneaky point, is, can't get water super cold, just
make water move. Jets stuff can turn anyone tried
like. Okay, can 40 degree. Bath awesome, try 60, water
moving right, break thermal layer. Normally little thin layer
water heating up. break up. It’s whole new world, yeah, absolutely
still cold. Water actually weaker way go correct can make
face stoic, make body circulate water around long
this. Maybe just one point heat uh: certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry,
sauna, steam saunas. Excuse me, jacuzzis can work pretty well yep um uh males.
looking conceive 60 days following uh uh following sauna um, hot tub realize
approaches severely limit number motile sperm um
substantially. people not trying conceive uh. Don'T think works
reliably enough, use form contraception yeah, people
trying conceive. really detrimental sperm Health right reason
people bring ice pack put groin near groin go
um, hard hot tub sauna. getting fine points,
um crude points, will pun intended, um, idea wouldn't want
anyone approach techniques compromise life goals, certainly not
allowed anywhere near things. uh, stage Life, just say
Natasha put x hanging Laird. reasons, like you're, not
going you're, not going none stuff, just wait right heat um heat


sperm relationship it’s not one that’s positive sperm


01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques

ways combine various types stimuli described inducing
recovery? talked breathing based tools which, adjust indeed
adjust oxygen carbon dioxide ratios Etc. guessing major effect
recovery going neural. It’s going deliberate, calm nervous system,
sympathetic, based uh, mentioned, yeah definitely, talked
movement based touch-based approaches. Um, will uh movement
circulate, certainly will circulate blood, also will generate contractions muscles yep
right, maybe, if, indeed again, still speculates you, indeed soreness
due excessive stretch swelling stretch, ends muscles
make sense movement touch thermal, ways combine
um effective maybe even synergistic yeah. suppose throw uh
compression garments put Pneumatic compression device sit sauna.
regulate breath like fine. Quite honestly, though,
probably don't need maximize them. joking. probably go
light swim regulating breathing cold water. get compression
cold, water good spot, certainly that. reality
is. generally look physical approach holistic approach breath
work. Basically, want breath something else knock two things
good spot, breath thermal stress, just
controlling unregulation stuff. also remember ice stressor
actually show data second actually can enhance
systemic recovery, although won't happen acute minutes. fact, it’s going
take least 30 60 minutes eventually see rebound effect, acutely it’s
going make actually sympathetic, going direction. can
opposite can actually drive up. it’s little bit dependent upon
respond, time day you're, using general, guess combining
need um, depending available. perhaps don't
sauna, can take hot bath great. Maybe percussion device
tool can use that. don't sauna amazing. don't ice bath


things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

task may may not want sympathetic Drive state. somebody sore
following workout, either locally sore muscle, group group muscles, maybe
legs chest torso maybe whole body sore sometimes case.
tools can Implement order accelerate the? want call
moving soreness, it’s really, know, alleviation soreness
bunch different processes. effective tools push back
soreness dissipate yeah? Absolutely. First all, it’s not lactate! That’s just really
important thing still hear people talk about. know sore 24 hours later
got thing get lactate there, talked metabolism,
uh conversation episode not cause fatigue it’s certainly not
cause soreness. not actionable tip there, just pet peeve mine. hear
people say get irritated can maybe end conversation um strategies,
tools, can do, can actually wear compression gear will help little
bit. decent amount evidence, suggesting, just you, know, put
tighter fitting clothes Leisure, wear compression gear. can
actually prevent little bit soreness occurring. case poor
Natasha - realize just done way way much went hung
bow hunting friend trained way hard, realize, oh, goodness,
going sore here. can immediately put compression gear weigh
really long possible. examples compression gear? seen
people plane high high socks um, mean anything wear
compression gear exercise. whether just know,
compression pants leggings tight fitting leggings uh, whether long sleeve
shirt, that’s like rash guard, wear know Jiu, Jitsu surfing, something
like that. long it’s tight fitting, doesn't much can wear.
suppose get socks, great, generally just tell leads them.
put long sleeve compression shirts wear training
long, compression, leggings that'd fine. Can people apply compression
um Garb training still get positive effects yeah? not seen
evidence suggest block adaptation. may case. not aware
studies happens, certainly know information suggests can
hands little bit Muscle Recovery. ideally one knows workout
trigger lot soreness yeah compression gear sort
offset that, local muscle groups working
Reason asked socks understanding. socks uh, compression


socks people plane it’s going shift patterns blood flow, not just
lower legs, body yeah you're, probably going want focus
actual exercising tissue, though, Actually, that’s really good question. don't know
answer whether not upper body workout lower body compression
gear. actually help that’s great question. may done. don't know,
don't know answer general, just tell people like where, whole
thing much can um, actually not concerned wearing
workout. something put afterwards even wear just little bit
compression day. Um actually really fun study. Uh. collaborated
um Bill Kramer who's. Uh, know, Sports scientist Year award. bill Cramer
award, gives indication uh University Connecticut, well Lee
Brown, two Lifetime Achievement Award winners put people plane
stores, Connecticut flew Cal State Fullerton. cross-country flight
got wear compression gear flight others not,
landed California training bout put back plane, went back stores
think another training bout got back there. lot data
came paper, one things clear compression group
effective handling blood related coagulation issues associated
long flights particularly athletic performance. that’s actually sneaky little Insider trick
use lot people, particularly athletes traveling, just wear
compression gear plane. talked sort rung study
mind another effective strategy, compression gear general, well
particularly plane, basically tighter can get better, without obviously
making hands purple uncomfortable things like that, doesn't
overly tight. Anything will work probably help. also personally,
anytime, taking

01:08:27 Tool: Acute Soreness, Massage, Temperature

flight like much can just feel little better get there.
methods can use alleviate acute soreness? Well, continue
theme, saying okay, use sort pressure manipulation
enhance recovery. compression one strategy, can also use things like compression
boots garments, nomadic devices will know, pump uh air outside
compress back forth. number devices will this. can


also use physical hand, massage body work they're, really
working best. can tell mechanisms effectively moving fluid
tissue, well potentially enhancing blood flow, increasing capitalization
going get nutrients waste products out. can kind pick
choose based upon budget preferences availability timing, things like that,
effective strategies outside really next largest category, now
thermal uh, far discussion, mentioned cold water, Immersion
talked hypertrophy section not want immediately: post
exercise, getting cold water ice bath trying grow muscle
mass. said that, good evidence showing cold water immersion
specifically effective reducing muscle soreness. fair consideration it’s
classic example no free passes physiology. Nothing always good
always bad. It’s always willing give versus willing
get case like cold water immersion? may thinking yeah. might want
hypertrophic adaptations, phase training,
actually trying push towards optimization moment, rather long-term
adaptation, ice bath might great choice. addition, fall scenario
like Natasha - realize like just unbelievably sore - might cost three
four five six days training. might worth accelerate recovery
process couple days don't miss much training. it’s just it’s
algorithm, it’s equation. looking season trying compete
just done way way much exercise, really significant pain.
probably willing give small percentage eventual muscle growth
single session get pain cold strategies. Cold water immersion clearly
best approach rather cold air tactics. cold shower probably
not enough here. really want either moderately cold. maybe 40 50
degree, water probably north 15 minutes can sub 40 little maybe
five minutes get fact number studies um.
sort summarizing bunch kind one rather going Point
point. numbers just threw uh, assuming um uh Fahrenheit um,
seem seem really cold right uncomfortably cold. Absolutely always recommend
people ease protocol overall not immediately go 35 degree uh
cold water, never done uh. said, people comfortable
uncomfortable, always answer question: cold exactly?
agree very, cold much really really want get out,
able stay safely? Whatever value happens be, absolutely


need safe. said that, actually, xbt Retreats, put dozens, not
hundreds people point, uh immediately sub 35 degree water first time
ever done. know three minutes multiple rounds session, can handle it.
don't need go crazy. don't want kind play game right,
want really really cold short amount time, want like kind
cold longer amount time? really mistake can make
something like know, 65 degree water people not comfortable
know five ten minutes. It’s just not going be. It’s probably not going
effective. like man 35 is, absolutely crazy want 55 degree, water
literature area. it’s going say need probably
somewhere, almost really north 10 minutes, will actually show need
like well north 20 30 minutes. money rather go really really
cold get done five minutes, um personal preference one. can also
make little bit easier yourself. not nearly much evidence,
contrast. Stuff uh, go cold, hot sort back forth.
no really good rules terms much go, many rounds, long
cold long hot couple studies obviously
studies use numbers, doesn't mean tested See optimal,
big difference, can really just kind play feel hot good
Recovery. just careful going put blood flow
area, may walk additional acute swelling isn't going
put greater pressure there. kind play that. personally really like
hot Recovery. will feel - maybe not great moment, next day tend feel
really really good. addition, wake next morning really really hurting
super stiff, hot bath will help um quite bit, can play
protocols. Again, don't

01:14:21 Cold & Heat Contrast, Cold Shower vs. Immersion, Sauna & Fertility

nice absolutely no requirement so. just option interested
studies Dr Susanna soberg sure yeah not directly aimed alleviating soreness
recovery, increasing thermal capacity storage uh Brown adipose
tissue, not blubbery fat stuff around clavicles around heart help
generate body, heat rest metabolism on, numbers um
come not tested possible derivations just like


breathing. five minute sessions, knows? Maybe minute
equally effective. just constraints sorts studies, values
come with, seem good thresholds making sure
adaptation response triggered heat cold. ends 57 minutes per week,
total uncomfortable safe heat case sauna, can one session
breaking couple sessions day different days, 11
minutes per week. cold either one single session multiple sessions, one
um one break know multiple days one day
one. know hour sauna 11 minutes colder vice versa,
although seems little bit extreme, especially uninitiated.
numbers studied. point out, not lot really thorough
studies examining different cold protocols according temperature time requirements.
bit subjective, feel required establish routine, actually say
another time re-emphasize something. talked beginning
conversation, pain not defined outcome. It’s heavily influenced
perception, so, don't feel like work you, won't work. feel like
work fantastic, so. It’s challenging field get really objective data
always going little bit subjective nature. things, can tell
anecdotally: used hot cold contrast long time athletes. love
don't care everything between. it’s one things never
mandate it. course, can't mandate anything anyone work with, never
know like hey. interested great struggling area? want try this?
liked great struggling area, tried it. didn't love it.
Okay, fine, not find routes, will get lot ways enhance
recovery um. one hasn't even really come stopping problem
first place, not just treating symptoms, first line defense,
really need go back figure it’s happening begin with, Solution,
just different acute symptom management tactics. One final point uh,
deliberate, cold exposure. think worth mentioning one reasons shower
effective, not nearly effective cold water, immersion immersion ice
neck simply reason stated before, showers not
going get cold not going get know sub 40s. Also cold
showers haven't really studied much have, not nearly much
immersion people always ask just think challenges studying cold water
exposure shower, can't really control mango? much body
covered, whether not head stays different size bodies, Etc? Whereas


people come laboratory, can get cold large, know neck
is. know chin can make sure people's arms um legs
underneath, cold shower sure can make everyone face away toward
shower, it’s really tricky um variations described. said,
agree one wants use deliberate cold exposure, cold shower better
nothing cold immersion circulating, cold water ice bath better um
cold shower yeah? actually say looking recovery muscle soreness,
say cold shower, probably little, not going able
get enough cold water onto muscle, besides, basically head, maybe
try cold bath least get surface area coverage, yeah want
use cold shower awesome reasons cold shower. That’s totally great.
trying use recover low back glutes sore training
good way, it’s probably not going much immersion there.
actually also hit sneaky point, is, can't get water super cold, just
make water move. Jets stuff can turn anyone tried
like. Okay, can 40 degree. Bath awesome, try 60, water
moving right, break thermal layer. Normally little thin layer
water heating up. break up. It’s whole new world, yeah, absolutely
still cold. Water actually weaker way go correct can make
face stoic, make body circulate water around long
this. Maybe just one point heat uh: certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry,
sauna, steam saunas. Excuse me, jacuzzis can work pretty well yep um uh males.
looking conceive 60 days following uh uh following sauna um, hot tub realize
approaches severely limit number motile sperm um
substantially. people not trying conceive uh. Don'T think works
reliably enough, use form contraception yeah, people
trying conceive. really detrimental sperm Health right reason
people bring ice pack put groin near groin go
um, hard hot tub sauna. getting fine points,
um crude points, will pun intended, um, idea wouldn't want
anyone approach techniques compromise life goals, certainly not
allowed anywhere near things. uh, stage Life, just say
Natasha put x hanging Laird. reasons, like you're, not
going you're, not going none stuff, just wait right heat um heat


sperm relationship it’s not one that’s positive sperm


01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques

ways combine various types stimuli described inducing
recovery? talked breathing based tools which, adjust indeed
adjust oxygen carbon dioxide ratios Etc. guessing major effect
recovery going neural. It’s going deliberate, calm nervous system,
sympathetic, based uh, mentioned, yeah definitely, talked
movement based touch-based approaches. Um, will uh movement
circulate, certainly will circulate blood, also will generate contractions muscles yep
right, maybe, if, indeed again, still speculates you, indeed soreness
due excessive stretch swelling stretch, ends muscles
make sense movement touch thermal, ways combine
um effective maybe even synergistic yeah. suppose throw uh
compression garments put Pneumatic compression device sit sauna.
regulate breath like fine. Quite honestly, though,
probably don't need maximize them. joking. probably go
light swim regulating breathing cold water. get compression
cold, water good spot, certainly that. reality
is. generally look physical approach holistic approach breath
work. Basically, want breath something else knock two things
good spot, breath thermal stress, just
controlling unregulation stuff. also remember ice stressor
actually show data second actually can enhance
systemic recovery, although won't happen acute minutes. fact, it’s going
take least 30 60 minutes eventually see rebound effect, acutely it’s
going make actually sympathetic, going direction. can
opposite can actually drive up. it’s little bit dependent upon
respond, time day you're, using general, guess combining
need um, depending available. perhaps don't
sauna, can take hot bath great. Maybe percussion device
tool can use that. don't sauna amazing. don't ice bath


things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

socks people plane it’s going shift patterns blood flow, not just
lower legs, body yeah you're, probably going want focus
actual exercising tissue, though, Actually, that’s really good question. don't know
answer whether not upper body workout lower body compression
gear. actually help that’s great question. may done. don't know,
don't know answer general, just tell people like where, whole
thing much can um, actually not concerned wearing
workout. something put afterwards even wear just little bit
compression day. Um actually really fun study. Uh. collaborated
um Bill Kramer who's. Uh, know, Sports scientist Year award. bill Cramer
award, gives indication uh University Connecticut, well Lee
Brown, two Lifetime Achievement Award winners put people plane
stores, Connecticut flew Cal State Fullerton. cross-country flight
got wear compression gear flight others not,
landed California training bout put back plane, went back stores
think another training bout got back there. lot data
came paper, one things clear compression group
effective handling blood related coagulation issues associated
long flights particularly athletic performance. that’s actually sneaky little Insider trick
use lot people, particularly athletes traveling, just wear
compression gear plane. talked sort rung study
mind another effective strategy, compression gear general, well
particularly plane, basically tighter can get better, without obviously
making hands purple uncomfortable things like that, doesn't
overly tight. Anything will work probably help. also personally,
anytime, taking

01:08:27 Tool: Acute Soreness, Massage, Temperature

flight like much can just feel little better get there.
methods can use alleviate acute soreness? Well, continue
theme, saying okay, use sort pressure manipulation
enhance recovery. compression one strategy, can also use things like compression
boots garments, nomadic devices will know, pump uh air outside
compress back forth. number devices will this. can


also use physical hand, massage body work they're, really
working best. can tell mechanisms effectively moving fluid
tissue, well potentially enhancing blood flow, increasing capitalization
going get nutrients waste products out. can kind pick
choose based upon budget preferences availability timing, things like that,
effective strategies outside really next largest category, now
thermal uh, far discussion, mentioned cold water, Immersion
talked hypertrophy section not want immediately: post
exercise, getting cold water ice bath trying grow muscle
mass. said that, good evidence showing cold water immersion
specifically effective reducing muscle soreness. fair consideration it’s
classic example no free passes physiology. Nothing always good
always bad. It’s always willing give versus willing
get case like cold water immersion? may thinking yeah. might want
hypertrophic adaptations, phase training,
actually trying push towards optimization moment, rather long-term
adaptation, ice bath might great choice. addition, fall scenario
like Natasha - realize like just unbelievably sore - might cost three
four five six days training. might worth accelerate recovery
process couple days don't miss much training. it’s just it’s
algorithm, it’s equation. looking season trying compete
just done way way much exercise, really significant pain.
probably willing give small percentage eventual muscle growth
single session get pain cold strategies. Cold water immersion clearly
best approach rather cold air tactics. cold shower probably
not enough here. really want either moderately cold. maybe 40 50
degree, water probably north 15 minutes can sub 40 little maybe
five minutes get fact number studies um.
sort summarizing bunch kind one rather going Point
point. numbers just threw uh, assuming um uh Fahrenheit um,
seem seem really cold right uncomfortably cold. Absolutely always recommend
people ease protocol overall not immediately go 35 degree uh
cold water, never done uh. said, people comfortable
uncomfortable, always answer question: cold exactly?
agree very, cold much really really want get out,
able stay safely? Whatever value happens be, absolutely


need safe. said that, actually, xbt Retreats, put dozens, not
hundreds people point, uh immediately sub 35 degree water first time
ever done. know three minutes multiple rounds session, can handle it.
don't need go crazy. don't want kind play game right,
want really really cold short amount time, want like kind
cold longer amount time? really mistake can make
something like know, 65 degree water people not comfortable
know five ten minutes. It’s just not going be. It’s probably not going
effective. like man 35 is, absolutely crazy want 55 degree, water
literature area. it’s going say need probably
somewhere, almost really north 10 minutes, will actually show need
like well north 20 30 minutes. money rather go really really
cold get done five minutes, um personal preference one. can also
make little bit easier yourself. not nearly much evidence,
contrast. Stuff uh, go cold, hot sort back forth.
no really good rules terms much go, many rounds, long
cold long hot couple studies obviously
studies use numbers, doesn't mean tested See optimal,
big difference, can really just kind play feel hot good
Recovery. just careful going put blood flow
area, may walk additional acute swelling isn't going
put greater pressure there. kind play that. personally really like
hot Recovery. will feel - maybe not great moment, next day tend feel
really really good. addition, wake next morning really really hurting
super stiff, hot bath will help um quite bit, can play
protocols. Again, don't

01:14:21 Cold & Heat Contrast, Cold Shower vs. Immersion, Sauna & Fertility

nice absolutely no requirement so. just option interested
studies Dr Susanna soberg sure yeah not directly aimed alleviating soreness
recovery, increasing thermal capacity storage uh Brown adipose
tissue, not blubbery fat stuff around clavicles around heart help
generate body, heat rest metabolism on, numbers um
come not tested possible derivations just like


breathing. five minute sessions, knows? Maybe minute
equally effective. just constraints sorts studies, values
come with, seem good thresholds making sure
adaptation response triggered heat cold. ends 57 minutes per week,
total uncomfortable safe heat case sauna, can one session
breaking couple sessions day different days, 11
minutes per week. cold either one single session multiple sessions, one
um one break know multiple days one day
one. know hour sauna 11 minutes colder vice versa,
although seems little bit extreme, especially uninitiated.
numbers studied. point out, not lot really thorough
studies examining different cold protocols according temperature time requirements.
bit subjective, feel required establish routine, actually say
another time re-emphasize something. talked beginning
conversation, pain not defined outcome. It’s heavily influenced
perception, so, don't feel like work you, won't work. feel like
work fantastic, so. It’s challenging field get really objective data
always going little bit subjective nature. things, can tell
anecdotally: used hot cold contrast long time athletes. love
don't care everything between. it’s one things never
mandate it. course, can't mandate anything anyone work with, never
know like hey. interested great struggling area? want try this?
liked great struggling area, tried it. didn't love it.
Okay, fine, not find routes, will get lot ways enhance
recovery um. one hasn't even really come stopping problem
first place, not just treating symptoms, first line defense,
really need go back figure it’s happening begin with, Solution,
just different acute symptom management tactics. One final point uh,
deliberate, cold exposure. think worth mentioning one reasons shower
effective, not nearly effective cold water, immersion immersion ice
neck simply reason stated before, showers not
going get cold not going get know sub 40s. Also cold
showers haven't really studied much have, not nearly much
immersion people always ask just think challenges studying cold water
exposure shower, can't really control mango? much body
covered, whether not head stays different size bodies, Etc? Whereas


people come laboratory, can get cold large, know neck
is. know chin can make sure people's arms um legs
underneath, cold shower sure can make everyone face away toward
shower, it’s really tricky um variations described. said,
agree one wants use deliberate cold exposure, cold shower better
nothing cold immersion circulating, cold water ice bath better um
cold shower yeah? actually say looking recovery muscle soreness,
say cold shower, probably little, not going able
get enough cold water onto muscle, besides, basically head, maybe
try cold bath least get surface area coverage, yeah want
use cold shower awesome reasons cold shower. That’s totally great.
trying use recover low back glutes sore training
good way, it’s probably not going much immersion there.
actually also hit sneaky point, is, can't get water super cold, just
make water move. Jets stuff can turn anyone tried
like. Okay, can 40 degree. Bath awesome, try 60, water
moving right, break thermal layer. Normally little thin layer
water heating up. break up. It’s whole new world, yeah, absolutely
still cold. Water actually weaker way go correct can make
face stoic, make body circulate water around long
this. Maybe just one point heat uh: certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry,
sauna, steam saunas. Excuse me, jacuzzis can work pretty well yep um uh males.
looking conceive 60 days following uh uh following sauna um, hot tub realize
approaches severely limit number motile sperm um
substantially. people not trying conceive uh. Don'T think works
reliably enough, use form contraception yeah, people
trying conceive. really detrimental sperm Health right reason
people bring ice pack put groin near groin go
um, hard hot tub sauna. getting fine points,
um crude points, will pun intended, um, idea wouldn't want
anyone approach techniques compromise life goals, certainly not
allowed anywhere near things. uh, stage Life, just say
Natasha put x hanging Laird. reasons, like you're, not
going you're, not going none stuff, just wait right heat um heat


sperm relationship it’s not one that’s positive sperm


01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques

ways combine various types stimuli described inducing
recovery? talked breathing based tools which, adjust indeed
adjust oxygen carbon dioxide ratios Etc. guessing major effect
recovery going neural. It’s going deliberate, calm nervous system,
sympathetic, based uh, mentioned, yeah definitely, talked
movement based touch-based approaches. Um, will uh movement
circulate, certainly will circulate blood, also will generate contractions muscles yep
right, maybe, if, indeed again, still speculates you, indeed soreness
due excessive stretch swelling stretch, ends muscles
make sense movement touch thermal, ways combine
um effective maybe even synergistic yeah. suppose throw uh
compression garments put Pneumatic compression device sit sauna.
regulate breath like fine. Quite honestly, though,
probably don't need maximize them. joking. probably go
light swim regulating breathing cold water. get compression
cold, water good spot, certainly that. reality
is. generally look physical approach holistic approach breath
work. Basically, want breath something else knock two things
good spot, breath thermal stress, just
controlling unregulation stuff. also remember ice stressor
actually show data second actually can enhance
systemic recovery, although won't happen acute minutes. fact, it’s going
take least 30 60 minutes eventually see rebound effect, acutely it’s
going make actually sympathetic, going direction. can
opposite can actually drive up. it’s little bit dependent upon
respond, time day you're, using general, guess combining
need um, depending available. perhaps don't
sauna, can take hot bath great. Maybe percussion device
tool can use that. don't sauna amazing. don't ice bath


things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

also use physical hand, massage body work they're, really
working best. can tell mechanisms effectively moving fluid
tissue, well potentially enhancing blood flow, increasing capitalization
going get nutrients waste products out. can kind pick
choose based upon budget preferences availability timing, things like that,
effective strategies outside really next largest category, now
thermal uh, far discussion, mentioned cold water, Immersion
talked hypertrophy section not want immediately: post
exercise, getting cold water ice bath trying grow muscle
mass. said that, good evidence showing cold water immersion
specifically effective reducing muscle soreness. fair consideration it’s
classic example no free passes physiology. Nothing always good
always bad. It’s always willing give versus willing
get case like cold water immersion? may thinking yeah. might want
hypertrophic adaptations, phase training,
actually trying push towards optimization moment, rather long-term
adaptation, ice bath might great choice. addition, fall scenario
like Natasha - realize like just unbelievably sore - might cost three
four five six days training. might worth accelerate recovery
process couple days don't miss much training. it’s just it’s
algorithm, it’s equation. looking season trying compete
just done way way much exercise, really significant pain.
probably willing give small percentage eventual muscle growth
single session get pain cold strategies. Cold water immersion clearly
best approach rather cold air tactics. cold shower probably
not enough here. really want either moderately cold. maybe 40 50
degree, water probably north 15 minutes can sub 40 little maybe
five minutes get fact number studies um.
sort summarizing bunch kind one rather going Point
point. numbers just threw uh, assuming um uh Fahrenheit um,
seem seem really cold right uncomfortably cold. Absolutely always recommend
people ease protocol overall not immediately go 35 degree uh
cold water, never done uh. said, people comfortable
uncomfortable, always answer question: cold exactly?
agree very, cold much really really want get out,
able stay safely? Whatever value happens be, absolutely


need safe. said that, actually, xbt Retreats, put dozens, not
hundreds people point, uh immediately sub 35 degree water first time
ever done. know three minutes multiple rounds session, can handle it.
don't need go crazy. don't want kind play game right,
want really really cold short amount time, want like kind
cold longer amount time? really mistake can make
something like know, 65 degree water people not comfortable
know five ten minutes. It’s just not going be. It’s probably not going
effective. like man 35 is, absolutely crazy want 55 degree, water
literature area. it’s going say need probably
somewhere, almost really north 10 minutes, will actually show need
like well north 20 30 minutes. money rather go really really
cold get done five minutes, um personal preference one. can also
make little bit easier yourself. not nearly much evidence,
contrast. Stuff uh, go cold, hot sort back forth.
no really good rules terms much go, many rounds, long
cold long hot couple studies obviously
studies use numbers, doesn't mean tested See optimal,
big difference, can really just kind play feel hot good
Recovery. just careful going put blood flow
area, may walk additional acute swelling isn't going
put greater pressure there. kind play that. personally really like
hot Recovery. will feel - maybe not great moment, next day tend feel
really really good. addition, wake next morning really really hurting
super stiff, hot bath will help um quite bit, can play
protocols. Again, don't

01:14:21 Cold & Heat Contrast, Cold Shower vs. Immersion, Sauna & Fertility

nice absolutely no requirement so. just option interested
studies Dr Susanna soberg sure yeah not directly aimed alleviating soreness
recovery, increasing thermal capacity storage uh Brown adipose
tissue, not blubbery fat stuff around clavicles around heart help
generate body, heat rest metabolism on, numbers um
come not tested possible derivations just like


breathing. five minute sessions, knows? Maybe minute
equally effective. just constraints sorts studies, values
come with, seem good thresholds making sure
adaptation response triggered heat cold. ends 57 minutes per week,
total uncomfortable safe heat case sauna, can one session
breaking couple sessions day different days, 11
minutes per week. cold either one single session multiple sessions, one
um one break know multiple days one day
one. know hour sauna 11 minutes colder vice versa,
although seems little bit extreme, especially uninitiated.
numbers studied. point out, not lot really thorough
studies examining different cold protocols according temperature time requirements.
bit subjective, feel required establish routine, actually say
another time re-emphasize something. talked beginning
conversation, pain not defined outcome. It’s heavily influenced
perception, so, don't feel like work you, won't work. feel like
work fantastic, so. It’s challenging field get really objective data
always going little bit subjective nature. things, can tell
anecdotally: used hot cold contrast long time athletes. love
don't care everything between. it’s one things never
mandate it. course, can't mandate anything anyone work with, never
know like hey. interested great struggling area? want try this?
liked great struggling area, tried it. didn't love it.
Okay, fine, not find routes, will get lot ways enhance
recovery um. one hasn't even really come stopping problem
first place, not just treating symptoms, first line defense,
really need go back figure it’s happening begin with, Solution,
just different acute symptom management tactics. One final point uh,
deliberate, cold exposure. think worth mentioning one reasons shower
effective, not nearly effective cold water, immersion immersion ice
neck simply reason stated before, showers not
going get cold not going get know sub 40s. Also cold
showers haven't really studied much have, not nearly much
immersion people always ask just think challenges studying cold water
exposure shower, can't really control mango? much body
covered, whether not head stays different size bodies, Etc? Whereas


people come laboratory, can get cold large, know neck
is. know chin can make sure people's arms um legs
underneath, cold shower sure can make everyone face away toward
shower, it’s really tricky um variations described. said,
agree one wants use deliberate cold exposure, cold shower better
nothing cold immersion circulating, cold water ice bath better um
cold shower yeah? actually say looking recovery muscle soreness,
say cold shower, probably little, not going able
get enough cold water onto muscle, besides, basically head, maybe
try cold bath least get surface area coverage, yeah want
use cold shower awesome reasons cold shower. That’s totally great.
trying use recover low back glutes sore training
good way, it’s probably not going much immersion there.
actually also hit sneaky point, is, can't get water super cold, just
make water move. Jets stuff can turn anyone tried
like. Okay, can 40 degree. Bath awesome, try 60, water
moving right, break thermal layer. Normally little thin layer
water heating up. break up. It’s whole new world, yeah, absolutely
still cold. Water actually weaker way go correct can make
face stoic, make body circulate water around long
this. Maybe just one point heat uh: certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry,
sauna, steam saunas. Excuse me, jacuzzis can work pretty well yep um uh males.
looking conceive 60 days following uh uh following sauna um, hot tub realize
approaches severely limit number motile sperm um
substantially. people not trying conceive uh. Don'T think works
reliably enough, use form contraception yeah, people
trying conceive. really detrimental sperm Health right reason
people bring ice pack put groin near groin go
um, hard hot tub sauna. getting fine points,
um crude points, will pun intended, um, idea wouldn't want
anyone approach techniques compromise life goals, certainly not
allowed anywhere near things. uh, stage Life, just say
Natasha put x hanging Laird. reasons, like you're, not
going you're, not going none stuff, just wait right heat um heat


sperm relationship it’s not one that’s positive sperm


01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques

ways combine various types stimuli described inducing
recovery? talked breathing based tools which, adjust indeed
adjust oxygen carbon dioxide ratios Etc. guessing major effect
recovery going neural. It’s going deliberate, calm nervous system,
sympathetic, based uh, mentioned, yeah definitely, talked
movement based touch-based approaches. Um, will uh movement
circulate, certainly will circulate blood, also will generate contractions muscles yep
right, maybe, if, indeed again, still speculates you, indeed soreness
due excessive stretch swelling stretch, ends muscles
make sense movement touch thermal, ways combine
um effective maybe even synergistic yeah. suppose throw uh
compression garments put Pneumatic compression device sit sauna.
regulate breath like fine. Quite honestly, though,
probably don't need maximize them. joking. probably go
light swim regulating breathing cold water. get compression
cold, water good spot, certainly that. reality
is. generally look physical approach holistic approach breath
work. Basically, want breath something else knock two things
good spot, breath thermal stress, just
controlling unregulation stuff. also remember ice stressor
actually show data second actually can enhance
systemic recovery, although won't happen acute minutes. fact, it’s going
take least 30 60 minutes eventually see rebound effect, acutely it’s
going make actually sympathetic, going direction. can
opposite can actually drive up. it’s little bit dependent upon
respond, time day you're, using general, guess combining
need um, depending available. perhaps don't
sauna, can take hot bath great. Maybe percussion device
tool can use that. don't sauna amazing. don't ice bath


things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

need safe. said that, actually, xbt Retreats, put dozens, not
hundreds people point, uh immediately sub 35 degree water first time
ever done. know three minutes multiple rounds session, can handle it.
don't need go crazy. don't want kind play game right,
want really really cold short amount time, want like kind
cold longer amount time? really mistake can make
something like know, 65 degree water people not comfortable
know five ten minutes. It’s just not going be. It’s probably not going
effective. like man 35 is, absolutely crazy want 55 degree, water
literature area. it’s going say need probably
somewhere, almost really north 10 minutes, will actually show need
like well north 20 30 minutes. money rather go really really
cold get done five minutes, um personal preference one. can also
make little bit easier yourself. not nearly much evidence,
contrast. Stuff uh, go cold, hot sort back forth.
no really good rules terms much go, many rounds, long
cold long hot couple studies obviously
studies use numbers, doesn't mean tested See optimal,
big difference, can really just kind play feel hot good
Recovery. just careful going put blood flow
area, may walk additional acute swelling isn't going
put greater pressure there. kind play that. personally really like
hot Recovery. will feel - maybe not great moment, next day tend feel
really really good. addition, wake next morning really really hurting
super stiff, hot bath will help um quite bit, can play
protocols. Again, don't

01:14:21 Cold & Heat Contrast, Cold Shower vs. Immersion, Sauna & Fertility

nice absolutely no requirement so. just option interested
studies Dr Susanna soberg sure yeah not directly aimed alleviating soreness
recovery, increasing thermal capacity storage uh Brown adipose
tissue, not blubbery fat stuff around clavicles around heart help
generate body, heat rest metabolism on, numbers um
come not tested possible derivations just like


breathing. five minute sessions, knows? Maybe minute
equally effective. just constraints sorts studies, values
come with, seem good thresholds making sure
adaptation response triggered heat cold. ends 57 minutes per week,
total uncomfortable safe heat case sauna, can one session
breaking couple sessions day different days, 11
minutes per week. cold either one single session multiple sessions, one
um one break know multiple days one day
one. know hour sauna 11 minutes colder vice versa,
although seems little bit extreme, especially uninitiated.
numbers studied. point out, not lot really thorough
studies examining different cold protocols according temperature time requirements.
bit subjective, feel required establish routine, actually say
another time re-emphasize something. talked beginning
conversation, pain not defined outcome. It’s heavily influenced
perception, so, don't feel like work you, won't work. feel like
work fantastic, so. It’s challenging field get really objective data
always going little bit subjective nature. things, can tell
anecdotally: used hot cold contrast long time athletes. love
don't care everything between. it’s one things never
mandate it. course, can't mandate anything anyone work with, never
know like hey. interested great struggling area? want try this?
liked great struggling area, tried it. didn't love it.
Okay, fine, not find routes, will get lot ways enhance
recovery um. one hasn't even really come stopping problem
first place, not just treating symptoms, first line defense,
really need go back figure it’s happening begin with, Solution,
just different acute symptom management tactics. One final point uh,
deliberate, cold exposure. think worth mentioning one reasons shower
effective, not nearly effective cold water, immersion immersion ice
neck simply reason stated before, showers not
going get cold not going get know sub 40s. Also cold
showers haven't really studied much have, not nearly much
immersion people always ask just think challenges studying cold water
exposure shower, can't really control mango? much body
covered, whether not head stays different size bodies, Etc? Whereas


people come laboratory, can get cold large, know neck
is. know chin can make sure people's arms um legs
underneath, cold shower sure can make everyone face away toward
shower, it’s really tricky um variations described. said,
agree one wants use deliberate cold exposure, cold shower better
nothing cold immersion circulating, cold water ice bath better um
cold shower yeah? actually say looking recovery muscle soreness,
say cold shower, probably little, not going able
get enough cold water onto muscle, besides, basically head, maybe
try cold bath least get surface area coverage, yeah want
use cold shower awesome reasons cold shower. That’s totally great.
trying use recover low back glutes sore training
good way, it’s probably not going much immersion there.
actually also hit sneaky point, is, can't get water super cold, just
make water move. Jets stuff can turn anyone tried
like. Okay, can 40 degree. Bath awesome, try 60, water
moving right, break thermal layer. Normally little thin layer
water heating up. break up. It’s whole new world, yeah, absolutely
still cold. Water actually weaker way go correct can make
face stoic, make body circulate water around long
this. Maybe just one point heat uh: certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry,
sauna, steam saunas. Excuse me, jacuzzis can work pretty well yep um uh males.
looking conceive 60 days following uh uh following sauna um, hot tub realize
approaches severely limit number motile sperm um
substantially. people not trying conceive uh. Don'T think works
reliably enough, use form contraception yeah, people
trying conceive. really detrimental sperm Health right reason
people bring ice pack put groin near groin go
um, hard hot tub sauna. getting fine points,
um crude points, will pun intended, um, idea wouldn't want
anyone approach techniques compromise life goals, certainly not
allowed anywhere near things. uh, stage Life, just say
Natasha put x hanging Laird. reasons, like you're, not
going you're, not going none stuff, just wait right heat um heat


sperm relationship it’s not one that’s positive sperm


01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques

ways combine various types stimuli described inducing
recovery? talked breathing based tools which, adjust indeed
adjust oxygen carbon dioxide ratios Etc. guessing major effect
recovery going neural. It’s going deliberate, calm nervous system,
sympathetic, based uh, mentioned, yeah definitely, talked
movement based touch-based approaches. Um, will uh movement
circulate, certainly will circulate blood, also will generate contractions muscles yep
right, maybe, if, indeed again, still speculates you, indeed soreness
due excessive stretch swelling stretch, ends muscles
make sense movement touch thermal, ways combine
um effective maybe even synergistic yeah. suppose throw uh
compression garments put Pneumatic compression device sit sauna.
regulate breath like fine. Quite honestly, though,
probably don't need maximize them. joking. probably go
light swim regulating breathing cold water. get compression
cold, water good spot, certainly that. reality
is. generally look physical approach holistic approach breath
work. Basically, want breath something else knock two things
good spot, breath thermal stress, just
controlling unregulation stuff. also remember ice stressor
actually show data second actually can enhance
systemic recovery, although won't happen acute minutes. fact, it’s going
take least 30 60 minutes eventually see rebound effect, acutely it’s
going make actually sympathetic, going direction. can
opposite can actually drive up. it’s little bit dependent upon
respond, time day you're, using general, guess combining
need um, depending available. perhaps don't
sauna, can take hot bath great. Maybe percussion device
tool can use that. don't sauna amazing. don't ice bath


things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

breathing. five minute sessions, knows? Maybe minute
equally effective. just constraints sorts studies, values
come with, seem good thresholds making sure
adaptation response triggered heat cold. ends 57 minutes per week,
total uncomfortable safe heat case sauna, can one session
breaking couple sessions day different days, 11
minutes per week. cold either one single session multiple sessions, one
um one break know multiple days one day
one. know hour sauna 11 minutes colder vice versa,
although seems little bit extreme, especially uninitiated.
numbers studied. point out, not lot really thorough
studies examining different cold protocols according temperature time requirements.
bit subjective, feel required establish routine, actually say
another time re-emphasize something. talked beginning
conversation, pain not defined outcome. It’s heavily influenced
perception, so, don't feel like work you, won't work. feel like
work fantastic, so. It’s challenging field get really objective data
always going little bit subjective nature. things, can tell
anecdotally: used hot cold contrast long time athletes. love
don't care everything between. it’s one things never
mandate it. course, can't mandate anything anyone work with, never
know like hey. interested great struggling area? want try this?
liked great struggling area, tried it. didn't love it.
Okay, fine, not find routes, will get lot ways enhance
recovery um. one hasn't even really come stopping problem
first place, not just treating symptoms, first line defense,
really need go back figure it’s happening begin with, Solution,
just different acute symptom management tactics. One final point uh,
deliberate, cold exposure. think worth mentioning one reasons shower
effective, not nearly effective cold water, immersion immersion ice
neck simply reason stated before, showers not
going get cold not going get know sub 40s. Also cold
showers haven't really studied much have, not nearly much
immersion people always ask just think challenges studying cold water
exposure shower, can't really control mango? much body
covered, whether not head stays different size bodies, Etc? Whereas


people come laboratory, can get cold large, know neck
is. know chin can make sure people's arms um legs
underneath, cold shower sure can make everyone face away toward
shower, it’s really tricky um variations described. said,
agree one wants use deliberate cold exposure, cold shower better
nothing cold immersion circulating, cold water ice bath better um
cold shower yeah? actually say looking recovery muscle soreness,
say cold shower, probably little, not going able
get enough cold water onto muscle, besides, basically head, maybe
try cold bath least get surface area coverage, yeah want
use cold shower awesome reasons cold shower. That’s totally great.
trying use recover low back glutes sore training
good way, it’s probably not going much immersion there.
actually also hit sneaky point, is, can't get water super cold, just
make water move. Jets stuff can turn anyone tried
like. Okay, can 40 degree. Bath awesome, try 60, water
moving right, break thermal layer. Normally little thin layer
water heating up. break up. It’s whole new world, yeah, absolutely
still cold. Water actually weaker way go correct can make
face stoic, make body circulate water around long
this. Maybe just one point heat uh: certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry,
sauna, steam saunas. Excuse me, jacuzzis can work pretty well yep um uh males.
looking conceive 60 days following uh uh following sauna um, hot tub realize
approaches severely limit number motile sperm um
substantially. people not trying conceive uh. Don'T think works
reliably enough, use form contraception yeah, people
trying conceive. really detrimental sperm Health right reason
people bring ice pack put groin near groin go
um, hard hot tub sauna. getting fine points,
um crude points, will pun intended, um, idea wouldn't want
anyone approach techniques compromise life goals, certainly not
allowed anywhere near things. uh, stage Life, just say
Natasha put x hanging Laird. reasons, like you're, not
going you're, not going none stuff, just wait right heat um heat


sperm relationship it’s not one that’s positive sperm


01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques

ways combine various types stimuli described inducing
recovery? talked breathing based tools which, adjust indeed
adjust oxygen carbon dioxide ratios Etc. guessing major effect
recovery going neural. It’s going deliberate, calm nervous system,
sympathetic, based uh, mentioned, yeah definitely, talked
movement based touch-based approaches. Um, will uh movement
circulate, certainly will circulate blood, also will generate contractions muscles yep
right, maybe, if, indeed again, still speculates you, indeed soreness
due excessive stretch swelling stretch, ends muscles
make sense movement touch thermal, ways combine
um effective maybe even synergistic yeah. suppose throw uh
compression garments put Pneumatic compression device sit sauna.
regulate breath like fine. Quite honestly, though,
probably don't need maximize them. joking. probably go
light swim regulating breathing cold water. get compression
cold, water good spot, certainly that. reality
is. generally look physical approach holistic approach breath
work. Basically, want breath something else knock two things
good spot, breath thermal stress, just
controlling unregulation stuff. also remember ice stressor
actually show data second actually can enhance
systemic recovery, although won't happen acute minutes. fact, it’s going
take least 30 60 minutes eventually see rebound effect, acutely it’s
going make actually sympathetic, going direction. can
opposite can actually drive up. it’s little bit dependent upon
respond, time day you're, using general, guess combining
need um, depending available. perhaps don't
sauna, can take hot bath great. Maybe percussion device
tool can use that. don't sauna amazing. don't ice bath


things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

people come laboratory, can get cold large, know neck
is. know chin can make sure people's arms um legs
underneath, cold shower sure can make everyone face away toward
shower, it’s really tricky um variations described. said,
agree one wants use deliberate cold exposure, cold shower better
nothing cold immersion circulating, cold water ice bath better um
cold shower yeah? actually say looking recovery muscle soreness,
say cold shower, probably little, not going able
get enough cold water onto muscle, besides, basically head, maybe
try cold bath least get surface area coverage, yeah want
use cold shower awesome reasons cold shower. That’s totally great.
trying use recover low back glutes sore training
good way, it’s probably not going much immersion there.
actually also hit sneaky point, is, can't get water super cold, just
make water move. Jets stuff can turn anyone tried
like. Okay, can 40 degree. Bath awesome, try 60, water
moving right, break thermal layer. Normally little thin layer
water heating up. break up. It’s whole new world, yeah, absolutely
still cold. Water actually weaker way go correct can make
face stoic, make body circulate water around long
this. Maybe just one point heat uh: certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry,
sauna, steam saunas. Excuse me, jacuzzis can work pretty well yep um uh males.
looking conceive 60 days following uh uh following sauna um, hot tub realize
approaches severely limit number motile sperm um
substantially. people not trying conceive uh. Don'T think works
reliably enough, use form contraception yeah, people
trying conceive. really detrimental sperm Health right reason
people bring ice pack put groin near groin go
um, hard hot tub sauna. getting fine points,
um crude points, will pun intended, um, idea wouldn't want
anyone approach techniques compromise life goals, certainly not
allowed anywhere near things. uh, stage Life, just say
Natasha put x hanging Laird. reasons, like you're, not
going you're, not going none stuff, just wait right heat um heat


sperm relationship it’s not one that’s positive sperm


01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques

ways combine various types stimuli described inducing
recovery? talked breathing based tools which, adjust indeed
adjust oxygen carbon dioxide ratios Etc. guessing major effect
recovery going neural. It’s going deliberate, calm nervous system,
sympathetic, based uh, mentioned, yeah definitely, talked
movement based touch-based approaches. Um, will uh movement
circulate, certainly will circulate blood, also will generate contractions muscles yep
right, maybe, if, indeed again, still speculates you, indeed soreness
due excessive stretch swelling stretch, ends muscles
make sense movement touch thermal, ways combine
um effective maybe even synergistic yeah. suppose throw uh
compression garments put Pneumatic compression device sit sauna.
regulate breath like fine. Quite honestly, though,
probably don't need maximize them. joking. probably go
light swim regulating breathing cold water. get compression
cold, water good spot, certainly that. reality
is. generally look physical approach holistic approach breath
work. Basically, want breath something else knock two things
good spot, breath thermal stress, just
controlling unregulation stuff. also remember ice stressor
actually show data second actually can enhance
systemic recovery, although won't happen acute minutes. fact, it’s going
take least 30 60 minutes eventually see rebound effect, acutely it’s
going make actually sympathetic, going direction. can
opposite can actually drive up. it’s little bit dependent upon
respond, time day you're, using general, guess combining
need um, depending available. perhaps don't
sauna, can take hot bath great. Maybe percussion device
tool can use that. don't sauna amazing. don't ice bath


things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques

ways combine various types stimuli described inducing
recovery? talked breathing based tools which, adjust indeed
adjust oxygen carbon dioxide ratios Etc. guessing major effect
recovery going neural. It’s going deliberate, calm nervous system,
sympathetic, based uh, mentioned, yeah definitely, talked
movement based touch-based approaches. Um, will uh movement
circulate, certainly will circulate blood, also will generate contractions muscles yep
right, maybe, if, indeed again, still speculates you, indeed soreness
due excessive stretch swelling stretch, ends muscles
make sense movement touch thermal, ways combine
um effective maybe even synergistic yeah. suppose throw uh
compression garments put Pneumatic compression device sit sauna.
regulate breath like fine. Quite honestly, though,
probably don't need maximize them. joking. probably go
light swim regulating breathing cold water. get compression
cold, water good spot, certainly that. reality
is. generally look physical approach holistic approach breath
work. Basically, want breath something else knock two things
good spot, breath thermal stress, just
controlling unregulation stuff. also remember ice stressor
actually show data second actually can enhance
systemic recovery, although won't happen acute minutes. fact, it’s going
take least 30 60 minutes eventually see rebound effect, acutely it’s
going make actually sympathetic, going direction. can
opposite can actually drive up. it’s little bit dependent upon
respond, time day you're, using general, guess combining
need um, depending available. perhaps don't
sauna, can take hot bath great. Maybe percussion device
tool can use that. don't sauna amazing. don't ice bath


things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

things. think, rather thinking optimal combination them, say just
use couple tactics based

01:24:34 Monitoring Overreaching & Overtraining

easily available situation, love teach us
methods longer form recovery, relates overreaching training.
Sure want think couple phases. Phase one try prevent
happening first place, uh terms training load you're, going just go back
previous episodes, talk, give specific instructions much increase
volume intensity per week, Etc. thing can do, then,
monitoring go different tools: cost free ones, well
higher technologically demanding ones monitor, see it’s actually happening,
third approach what, already occurred, figured
get back hole? like just sort tackle one one order
talk about, happening, tools can use going work right
anytime talking fatigue management here. people aware
terms sort Technology, you're, probably getting sort
Readiness score recovery score strain depending app watch Tech
have. little bit vernacular change sport performance world,
might looking things like load GPS, tracking monitoring, really
is, thing it’s trying either one predict problem going happen
future placing restrictions upon don't run situation,
thing possibly identifying drop physiology performance,
saying need get hole. That’s really! happening,
think first one just imagine scenario like mileage limitation, uh pitch count
baseball happened is. know, individuals fields
looked said, hey notice people throw say 100 pitches
game tend start losing Effectiveness increase injury rate. Therefore, predicting
next time go play. cross threshold, start increased risk
negative consequences. therefore, going cap case pitching volume
hundred pitches per game whatever case thing running, etc, etc.
just simply actually really cool data coming now sport
performance stuff. Looking things like, using GPS trackers trying identify even
position position specific recommendations much distance cover


practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

practice trending session um can say, hey positions, don't cross
threshold. positions don't cross threshold basketball tennis kinds
things like that. That’s not probably extremely applicable many listeners right now,
still conveying idea understand break, can stop
getting first place. functional example just thinking
basic things like: start training program progress
already covered numbers either case, though, want three
markers paying attention concerned, getting
overreaching phase potentially going lead training, want get
three unique things number one going look sort performance metric
right. times going squat numbers, power
going things, it’s got actual performance number two,
sort physiology, want see something happening resting heart rate.
biomarker moving heart rate variability. measure not influenced
beauty using biological markers are. contrast like performance -
said: okay, performance test. Every day come going vertical
jump one day come sudden, vertical jump super low. might think
oh man, maybe starting overreach. also feeling lazy day just
not jumped high purpose, didn't want work beauty
biomarkers. don't get manipulate like that? don't care,
downside it, maybe they're. Just indirect markers right, not telling
biological markers, better performance markers. saying want look
right? fact, want look third category well, sort
symptomology, symptom overreaching. seeing
performance Sacrament saying biological marker well? see
three popping up, reason believe reached overt reaching
now. not identified yet is, functional, overreaching, non-functional,
overreaching true training remember shouldn't feeling great every
training session. trying cause adaptation back off, maybe even
weeks months later, actualize adaptation get super compensation
performance increase, going invest little bit going go
hole. sport performance coach going look numbers throughout year say
yeah first start training preparation season. going see drop
performance day week. That’s part plan, though right. That’s stress,
trying accumulate, want see three markers just want
pay attention couple things. long day three days, seven


days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food

days, 15 days, Etc? seeing performance drop day - far away
performance uh day want Peak - not going anything
different. see two days row drop performance, not worried. see
probably opinion five days row decrement, might start paying attention
season, though close competition whatever. thing means you,
see couple days row dropping, might actually want
take steps mitigate that. really important. understand again,
trying do? trying cause adaptation? trying cause adaptation,
specific example - can run uh second
then, course, bunch tools pull phases. that’s that’s
fundamentally trying here. encourage again, don't
reactive responsive one measure, going cover whole bunch
second, can get lost different things pros cons.
know it’s simple just look one score watch make decisions
check app. really want careful

01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep

going probably lead wrong direction often
going help yourself. curious why, overreach much
often training, performance diminished because, face
it’s kind obvious you're, overreaching training, performance diminished,
that’s completely circular hear things Like adrenal fatigue adrenal burnout,
well, turns out. Adrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely not.
thing adrenal insufficiency syndrome, course know phrases like burn
adrenal burnout training, um thrown around it. know much words like
gaslighting obsessive compulsive. know without real clinical definition um
clinical definitions, people aren't obeying use language.
want acknowledge. However, absolutely true, overreaching
much often training? can degrade performance mechanistically speaking,
going on, think understand going mechanistically,
think can look tools whether not it’s breathing movement, compression thermal
psychological motivational, Etc much clearer sense going work
best likely won't work? love question much because, mentioned
beginning, fortunate spend graduate work Andy Fry's Lab


University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes

University Memphis lot area, we, fact learned
assays run Western blots measure signaling proteins, things like this,
stuff near dear heart. also bunch really wild studies
done got there, going combine kind antifrey's entire career
just highlight big pictures found um. interested
exercise particularly strength, training trying figure entire question right,
like. actually happening work much, lift much
sudden, can't sleep happening like? energy down?
mood? motivation reduced squat much whole series studies across
career just sort highlight themes ran
them. first one jumps mind early career. really
awesome protocol um, people squat 100 back squat Max every day
two weeks, coming gym, think first one machine
one rep max came Back every single day two weeks,
generally call kind like short moderate range overreaching and,
definition end actually true training, take
individuals sometimes two Eight weeks return back one rep max
end protocols um, non-functional overreaching
combination well, along that, took lot blood samples well muscle
biopsies, try look happening, endocrinologically neurologically muscle,
physiology wise pay attention happened. couple things jump there,
one initial studies - actually, think, first one ran first
squat everyday protocol. found catecholamine levels change quite significantly
depending kind wanted pay attention there, whether
epinephrine norepinephrine even markers. basically increased
somewhere two threefold little bit understanding. sleep physiology
adrenaline extremely high, epinephrine you're, going hard time sleeping,
alone first indication. like wait. minute something's actually happening
here, that’s just beyond muscle, soreness, sort systemic fatigue happening
and, rightfully pointed out, not adrenal glands becoming fatigued, that’s sort
bit tongue-in-cheek pedantics. cortisol, dysregulation general stress syndrome,
it’s really can noted blood terms epinephrine norepinephrine. Another
study done similar realm course seven half days
people came 15 training sessions, really cool. really
short bouts just ridiculous training said: okay, like something's happening with,
epinephrine norepinephrine something hap something's happening


testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

testosterone. look like inside cell, now muscle biopsies came board
started looking things like map kinases, signaling proteins
tend associated anabolic response, say upregulate muscle protein synthesis
many things. that’s like big factor them. looked various
androgens glucocorticoid receptors wanted say like well. Maybe receptor,
density sensitivity changing fact surprise surprise. That’s exactly
found. found Androgen glucocorticoid. Receptor concentrations
reduced, can start see picture forming, like hmm, similar
insulin type 2 diabetes story, really put high stress
situation, presumably epinephrine, Etc. Testosterone releases extremely high.
response that, try reach back level homeostasis, start regulating
receptors them, it’s like signal can get high going keep
gas going pull back throttle receptor total signal
stays makes little bit sense. Well, becomes obviously problematic
um. then, like final follow-up study here, important note, another
protocol really really cool said first ones weren't enough.
going come every day two weeks going 10 sets
one rep max every day, coming 10. One rep Maxes every
day two weeks really cool study. didn't complete
repetitions, repeat 10 successful one rep Maxes that, given
day um, absolutely brutal brutal protocol. wasn't time um. finished
right got campus, actually able around
final analyzes tissue um. want look particular
study beta, adrenergic receptors, receptors going
epinephrine going binding similar story here. Um, perhaps
losing overall sensitivity extreme sympathetic stimulation now,
actually, thinking back, pretty cool another group
regulation breathing post see can ameliorate
Problems, no course, 20. plus years ago, something like that, couple
things happened one rep Maxes dropped by. think around, like eight kilos
end two weeks, remember right like group average, something
neighborhood 151 kilos, pretty well trained individuals went
rather, think, actually 160 kilos dropped like 152 kilos. It’s
something close that. significant, though, power dropped 35
percent, really really interesting, if, pay attention declines
physical performance time - mean that, like aging, see


people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

people can hold muscle mass pretty? Well, will go know, one
percent age 40.. However, strength will go like two four percent
Power eight ten percent, look actually World Records across
strength, Sports age, see will decline age, not much. However,
look Speed Sports age, fall off planet, it’s challenging
preserve fast Time whether fatigue age. That’s really
important, that'll tell hey little bit canary coal mine not
necessarily strength, speed, lot different techniques use
measure performance. Remember that’s Triad right, symptomology, physiology
performance. generally, better looking speed based performance tests rather
strength based performance tests get earlier indication potential overreaching
training, anyways back individual study um group again,
problem took two eight weeks come back
is, can't remember exact time frame. probably
thought this, come back, something like every week
every couple days, even study finished got back Baseline, one
rep max took eight Weeks finally got back,
probably classic uh training State place, done
little two weeks, also another point people always ask like uh like
long take? something happen course months like?
go, two days intense training camp two three weeks? actually
cause training, answer actually truly enough volume enough
intensity, probably can significant damage little two weeks probably
doesn't happen often likely probably going reaching state
non-functional overreaching, may actually able put position
might take three four weeks get back Baseline truly intense
think protocol. It’s like totally unrealistic part, 10 sets one
one rep max squat every day two straight weeks: um, folks, extremely
highly trained weightlifter. might something like close say
World Championships, outside really specific scenario, it’s totally absurd training
protocol. point right. trying ensure uh ensure training
met close. It’s similar done actually done. think three
studies center support performance Dom's muscle, soreness
cases just like ridiculous leg extension protocols, just trying ensure
cause super soreness. don't, nothing study um absurd
training protocols, that’s point nonetheless um result sure enough


beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food

beta adrenergic receptors regulated something like 37 percent um.
probably even significant, though, sensitivity receptors reduced
like two half fold, it’s like okay, wait minute becoming desensitized
timeline also actually now starting reduce total concentration, similar,
Actually interesting, sneaky smart thing do. looked
nocturnal urinary, epinephrine guess also like 50 percent 15, one
five, five, zero, five, zero yeah now you're, seeing tie-in it’s like um?
seeing response tissue level, seeing response, probably although didn't
actually look pituitary. Anything like that, seeing adrenal endocrinological
problems, also seeing increase concentration Ben epinephrine.
supposed sleeping surprise, surprise hard time sleeping
symptomology, that’s interesting finding nocturnal epinephrine epinephrine,
course, adrenaline. It’s released adrenals no surprise there, also
brain area called Locus, ceruleus brain, Brain tends called epinephrine
body adrenaline just complicate everyone's understanding, nomenclature
not come us. don't blame us. point rapid eye movements lead
called REM. Sleep abundant second half night. know
dreams associated rapid eye movement - sleep emotionally Laden
dreams emotional states actually important discarding emotional
load previous day's experiences. It’s sort natural trauma therapy will,
normal, healthy state dreams associated within inability release
epinephrine night. me, just described! First all, it’s first time ever
heard um, ties together something really quite clear Sleep Neuroscience
literature, people stressed, tend get less rapid eye movement,
sleep rapid eye movement, sleep normally Associated low levels epinephrine,
whether not it’s causal not, isn't clear sort doesn't matter sake
discussion. wondering - suppose one test for, maybe observed,
whether not people training much reaching much
elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether not
emotional state also um Disrupted, one thing know sure want
disrupt somebody's emotional state, deprive sleep rap eye movement -
sleep particular. one caveat heard
rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation, deliberate, rapid eye movement, sleep deprivation
treatment depression. true, it’s coupled next night enhanced rapid eye
movement, sleep. one major takeaways uh realizing
no surprise daytime activities impact



01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol

Nighttime, endocrine function, impact quality sleep impact, daytime activities, yeah,
actually, many fun things want now um. actually
measuring eye movement fantastic tool understanding, total stress load
can actually differentiate different types stress, caffeine use versus alcohol use versus
sleep deprivation actually measuring eye movements. That’s actually
absolute rest. Sleep company is, addition getting full PSD sleep study done
bedroom, you're, going get eye tracking assessment going able
figure getting um. Nonetheless, yeah, actually look
classic signs symptoms training training syndrome, it’s going
everything performance. Decrements like talked um heart resting heart rate,
going increase going see things like HRV drop. generally 20 percent,
large disruption HRV, decreased body weight stuff
Andrew just talked motivation. Adherence appetite mood - stuff
classically known associations overtrain that’s exact reasons
talking sleep disturbances disruptions wanting train motivation. stuff
uh goes part parcel non-functional overreaching training. can
actually tie back little bit biomarkers, great,
stuff look for. physiology stuff. look um,
probably talked shpg sex hormone, binding globulin. it’s
protein that'll float body. That’s going bind sex hormones particular
testosterone. happens um training? can actually take serially
like week week will actually see number rise, so, see like say,
using service like inside tracker you're, getting blood measured
every often - see Number start ticking up. actually associated
because, actually happening it’s binding free testosterone that’s
just leading back circle talking can actually see thing
happen calorie restriction not eat enough calories, Particular case
actually happens scenarios, know it’s not issue simply
caloried. It’s clearly issue training load high, just give another
little tool. can get link it, website created
Journal uh slipping, get you. can link can actually go
plug number values mud chemistry. got blood work done


can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

can plug pre-number post number say got done
maybe 10 weeks later got done wondering notice, hey
free testosterone's Shpg up, actually meaningful number you? will
actually tell whether not change prediposed physiologically Meaningful not,
just within error margin measure, can actually change like right
website. can change confidence interval, it’s really really cool. know,
just blood want know like hey, level year
now it’s know here. there, it’s totally free resource created, gone peer
review, stuff give link that. that’s pretty cool measure addition
that, like probably one powerful easy metrics uh biologically, take
cortisol DHEA ratio. known associated lot things. want
really careful. don't want number high low something like 0.09.
cortisol DHEA DHA, cortisol ratio DHEA cortisol love. tell you, said
backwards purpose, just make sure everyone understood, got backwards. Yeah
mean ratio associated many things do.
careful Association right, not causation, everything risk infections,
metabolic health like disease States, well talking
hey Mike getting sort cortisolous Regulation, lot folks
call? know adrenal fatigue no that’s not really happening,
adrenaline epinephrine off testosterone cortisol going along right,
can also look things like testosterone cortisol ratios. So, lot
things can glean give insights going, that,
ratio high, that’s going associated metabolic syndrome bunch
stuff. it’s low that’s going associated lot cognitive problems like
aggression mood bunch things like that, again, want keep right
around 0.09 ratio time actually blood chemistry, stuff Get
get report can calculate pretty quickly. sure get


01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation

Episode comes next uh nutrition supplementation totally. compounds
lower cortisol, ashwagandha um? can see now based logic
spelling phases lot intense overreaching frequent overreaching,


given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

given compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rhodiola Rosea um, one word say,
um two words, first one. fun say: Rhodiola, folks Ashwagandha
uh trying, Rhodiola, recently um mainly buffer Output um. seem
good data attached related lowering uh one's perceived threshold
hard working. words, can work harder not feel
working really hard, allows work. That’s sort subjective
description works, told um Can blunt cortisol ashwagandha.
know blonde's cortisol. things, course, can things,
um compounds sometimes will incorporate training? Regimen uh
using Rhodiola probably six years like pretty consistently, not personally,
using individual. work with. need little bit careful. wouldn't say
blunts cortisol, probably purpley described cortisol modulator uh,
means sort it’s high low it'll help kind keep within normative range. Um,
also. important note. handful studies two
know specifically showed uh Rhodiola use kind hands, strength gains. However,
may reduce muscular endurance, need human data stuff may turn
that’s not concern. may also turn concern, nothing is, nothing perfect
free. no supplement. Panacea um. used really lot
situations, thing kind pay attention cortisol is:
ha it’s supposed modulated throughout day? It’s not supposed
normal now. fact, look normative values - um, it’s typically uh described uh
micrograms per deciliter depending literally company used draw blood
getting blood depending method use analyze it.
normative values are, like, frankly, embarrassingly place: um they're, mostly
going like 5 25, quote: unquote normative value, that’s outrageous. also
know numbers vary massively age sex throughout day, so,
taking single point, assume fasted blood draw,
folks do. It’s really going tell lot about. happening moment,
need know well, like maybe say cortisol was, say, 38 year old woman
7am cortisol 15 milligrams per deciliter, that’s pretty good, it’s 15
milligrams per deciliter 3 pm, oh boy, probably issues right,
change throughout day need able plot curve. can actually
well pretty standard practice do. look cortisol throughout day going
take multiple markers, don't want just see Baseline cortisol? want
see curve throughout day. That’s going tell ton sleep
caused regulation. training? something else, like take


single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

single Baseline blood marker cortisol lot grain salt. typically
measured least three times throughout day, something like six nine a.m, twelve
three something like closer evening oftentimes. much
like seven points something like throughout day, depending situation.
want careful um. Just since here, can also get cortisol uh
saliva now sort pros cons that, pro
blood it’s it. It’s much stable, um saliva extremely responsive whatever
happened seconds took test. upside it, though, you, can
bunch real world life experiments so, example, will this. Sometimes, want
see individual responding given stressor, take right, take it, take
know, spin tube going take going go.
workout cold exposure, whatever going do, take end. know
it’s responsive just happened, that’s point um. can actually
sort pros cons, use appropriate measure appropriate uh question
trying answer couple points Reflections cortisol. first uh
laboratory Duty undergraduate actually biopsychology lab
time didn't field Neuroscience, it’s now called, called
biopsychology psychobiology. didn't know no used neurochemistry
neurobiology. collapsed call now called Neuroscience,
years ago, job collect cortisol samples, means
collecting um spit, means collecting saliva advantage saliva based
cortisol free cortisol. It’s active form, mentioned, it’s reflective happened
seconds minutes um, just prior couple things regular cortisol pattern
across day, realized that, wonderful everybody get
cortisol measured Detail multiple times Blood saliva, on. people
just won't whatever reason can't that. Yeah basic Contour
healthy pattern cortisol secretion uh highest levels cortisol morning. Um
actually part mechanism, that’s associated waking. viewing bright light,
ideally sunlight, forms bright light early day actually can lead 50
percent five zero percent increase cortisol Spike, good thing. People hear
elevated cortisol, oh no, sets motion Cascade things related enhanced
mood alertness, immune system function, Etc. think can useful people
understand many things will Spike cortisol throughout day. Stress cold water
exercise, idea comes baseline near Baseline um, rather quickly.
One worst situations, pointed out, highest level cortisol
consistently shifted afternoon period. fact, that’s pretty reliable signature certain


forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

forms depression. worked colleague, David Spiegel Stanford Psychiatry
great Bob sapolski Robert sapolsky uh. zebras don't get ulcers, behave,
Etc fame lots lots popular books um? think people trying
regulate cortisol just under, just understand basic Contour
Baseline be, know rise pretty quickly. one rises morning, it’s
easy remember: rise rise rise bed Rise cortisol light bright light
exercise um caffeine. things will increase cortisol then, across day, it’s
normal cortisol spike, use regulation methods
described particular breathing methods exercise itself, case may be,
really pay attention much psychological physical stress occurring
six hours eight hours prior sleep um? seem like good sort
broad Contour healthy pattern cortisol release? actually
want cortisol reduce inflammation initiate participate recovery process,
will not see progress exercise training without large spike cortisol.
critically important think phrases like cortisol inflammation stress. not bad
right. Physiology not personified right there. Things don't like ate body right,
all, not good bad. just um try suppress cortisol
suppress adaptation. want exactly mentioned. Large spikes met
large quick recovery, want throughout day get hormetic
stressor. going back ashwagandha Rhodiola issue um it. think
short-sighted people that, prophylactic okay,
you, blunt cortisol you're, going cause immunosuppressant, especially early
day totally taking ashwagandha going train, is, counterproductive. Yeah.
not just not baseline part foundational package right go look
athlete foundations athlete resilience, protocols put together not going
see things there. specific reason, um form cortisol regulation needs
done strategically. excessively high bringing back
normative values right time, great, normal, though taking
lower actually problematic. thing actually true since
oxidative stress information antioxidant use mentioned, think earlier taking
vitamin C vitamin E post exercise will actually blunt adaptations, least
potential thing right modulating response just -
not done actually biological testing indicated needed
then. actually may making things worse, see constantly people
take number supplements substances sleep, wake
next morning. Groggy cortisol suppressed okay great. take


something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes

something stimulation rest day trying reduce,
need nasty cycle instead just getting way letting cortisol it’s
supposed making sure again, teaching actually coachable
response. can coach body go later part day go
earlier part day. want make sure driving train intent
reiterate, don't need shouldn't, right, don't need
lower cortisol, shouldn't walk around it, just going suppress state
even Far - needed - needed anabolic responses like not
going grow muscle cortisol not spiked, it’s going compromise it. Rather, want


02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep

Intentional practices, especially form supplementation,
intentional. heard said carbohydrates, particular, starchy carbohydrates, can
inhibit cortisol. Definitely, uh tryptophan amino acid related
pathway ratchets uh serotonin release. Probably things too. mean
idea carbohydrates, just stimulate serotonin little bit uh, overly similarious cellular
mechanisms ampk going immediately turning yeah right um. know,
think, experienced uh. know stressed stressed doesn't
necessarily even highly processed. know uh fat associ, know fatty
carbohydrates, um, know like potato chips potato chips dip kinds
things. can also uh. Polarizable oatmeal Bowl pasta, um, not trying
demonize um carbohydrates. ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally non-processed
carbohydrates um, time, not time, fairly potent effect
lowering stress perceived stress even quality sleep, not say
somebody load like crazy, unless glycogen really depleted, talked
lot endurance episode. know touch nutrition
supplementation episode, um thinking relationship carbohydrates
cortisol just talking terms cortisol vitally
important adaptation Trigger triggering adaptation. It’s probably better way put
it, can blunt cortisol taken post, training um, maybe evening sleep.
basic ways one can think maybe use carbohydrates
specific ways order say, control cortisol rather uh quash cortisol uh.
actually alluded number times already, oftentimes will give people lot


carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

carbohydrates night. reasons, going feel fantastic, lot
people, helps sleep get sleep stay asleep. Sleep Quality - talked
specifically remember, think it. way, cortisol core, energy signaling
molecule. says need energy, great um epinephrine's way
start seeing, example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids. Put
bloodstream, get prepared something. problem it’s continually elevated
throughout day, no regulation, start running issues right. again,
differentiation between. Oh, cortisol slightly elevated day versus really
big big spike training, really big spike breath, protocol, Etc,
went back down. said, ingest carbohydrates, telling
quick see signal nutrients. energy again, specifically carbohydrates.
Therefore, cortisol can sort go back down. don't need liberating free fatty acids
preparing uh need fuel, can help go sleep many,
pointed many mechanisms actually carbohydrates will help sleep night um
some, not people, one relationships cortisol
great. look forward hearing various macronutrients
micronutrients so-called adaptogens mysterious group yeah yeah
compounds. know word adaptogen gets thrown around much nowadays,
long talking adaptation, think that'll fair play

02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

uh discussion next episode nutrition supplementation
laboratory, study stress, use number different markers subjective reports
stressed people feel uh heart rate morning, heart rate, heart rate, variability, cortisol,
free cortisol markers stress relates
exercise adaptations Recovery, again, think seeing lot
parallels study psychological stress study physical stress
relates exercise adaptation. Remember terms physiology stress stress.
cool term valastatic load allostasis really doesn't matter
system test, will reflect overall stress. know mentioned several them.
got done talking biomarkers, HRV heart rate another great
example, trying this, talking muscle
soreness thing, really getting marker fix overuse
particular muscle now really transitioned Global markers overuse


problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

problematic important pay attention rather again.
indicators didn't just work, muscle hard, actually done
something compromised. physiology level
influenced circulating, catecholamine something that’s going influence multiple
markers. Now, like sleep mood behavior, that’s things
problematic. said, look resting heart rate, not bad thing do.
However, multiple downsides. One thing know resting heart
rate will Elevate excessive stress load. actually doesn't matter physical,
stress psychological stress combination, will see number drift
time. downside, though, it’s not tremendously sensitive smaller stressors uh.
words, something like alcohol good example, will see
resting heart rate Elevate alcohol use, excessive tobacco use psychological
stress. However, something smaller like hard training sessions, resting heart, rate's,
not sensitive enough pick up, will actually probably stay same. So,
reasons don't actually use resting heart rate much will take it, it’s not
primary indicator. said, HRV better use, just wear quickly
not familiar uh, heart rate, say, example, you, resting heart rate, 60
beats per minute. means every second, it’s beating. doesn't actually happen
consistent Rhythm beat second, one beat second two beat
second three Etc. rate variable, might go, beat beat, beat,
variation heart rate end 60 seconds example,
still completed 60 beats. just aren't exact pattern. Well, one thing: that’s
actually quite interesting amount variation heart rate actually associated
overall sympathetic parasympathetic State large variation.
arithmic pattern generally representative rested recovered
parasympathetic. notice, times extremely high stress, will
rhythmic, beat beat beat b b, little bit confusing idea, high
HRV indicated lot variation, meaning pretty recovered low Hrv,
meaning not lot variation, means you're, probably pretty stressed wired,
it’s it’s uh related heart rate, opinion significantly better marker now
one thing want pay attention to. couple things,
accuracy issues many devices. Basically, everybody point probably
device, that’s telling hrb. not want simply compare
number somebody else lot reasons. Not Technologies actually
even measuring thing again. actually combining
metrics calling overall Readiness recovery, now we've.


actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

actually done made couple assumptions stacked whole
host assumptions giving number, don't know sort
black box score actually even represents. caution one taking much
information actually measuring HRV, even within lot
ways calculate not important here. don't necessarily worry score
come compare yourself, not others. will see is, use
similar devices techniques. hard find data here, general, people
overweight might little bit lower score. worse score, need
information clear. large part, best way use something like HRV
measure exact circumstances every day. whether going use
just device watch phone bed anything else. going
buy special HRV it? It’s fine just take measure. time, mostly,
means first thing morning. wake up. go bathroom. come back
take measure something like that. don't uh wait. Sometimes took
food, then, look phone, like things can influence
stress take. didn't usually take somewhere seconds minutes record,
want pay attention now. One things notice natural
change HIV just happens, kind really want pay attention
is, guess, answering question much change HRV happen
before. care - it’s hard answer right. So, just say HRV
hundred. just made number what, wake tomorrow it’s 99.?
mean? Well, don't know wake tomorrow it’s 20.. That’s probably bad thing:
well, line it’s hard. One thing recommend taking HRV
least month start using value make changes, recommend
taking first thing morning, yep always roughly time. Basically,
circumstances, doesn't technical morning, day
will change days get that’s stable thing life.
take then, collect least day least month, rather maybe
even six weeks give basically running average. quite
honestly uh. will actually track forever always look
look like today, relative last week average, look like
historical average, always compare things, also want make
sure compare like like so, words, generally will not going worry
today’s HRV score relative tomorrow's. want look today’s relative
exact day last week, not athletes, non-athletes. important,
imagine don't worry difference HRV score Monday compared


Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

Tuesday pay attention Monday compared last Monday Monday that.
That’s typically sort weekly schedule don't want
say, look Monday's HRV score, reflection happens Sunday
compare Tuesdays, actually reflection happened Monday.
probably didn't stressors Sundays Monday, not actually comparing
thing. General weekly schedule, likely compare
Mondays relative last Mondays comparing happened
previous day. sort Distinction make sense? Absolutely thing
body weight way, trying track body mass gain fat loss something
compare like like, can look daily changes, need pay attention
normal distribution is. kind that, know Monday Monday thing,
that'll give rough area saying. Okay, normal weekly variation say five,
average 100, will fluctuate 95 105.. That’s standard deviation sort
science. Dorks call start changing five percent outside
normal standard deviation, going start paying attention little bit
going actually run little bit algorithm one. thinking
process get HIV really metric, HRV example using first step.
collect good data mean again. measure way measured
every single day get look phone first realized oh crap, forgot
take HRV went back got say 15 derivation
normal number realized oh yeah, that’s right. super late last night,
whatever okay great going consider bad data. didn't good. it’s bad day,
not anything ignore bad data throw out, don't use decide
part. assume good data. Okay, great then, going next
question, acute? words, just today right chronic,
pattern happening five days, least three last four
something like three minimum like honestly. generally look five
days, that’s big distinction something just happened today next
question going ask is, adaptation phase trying
phase trying Cause insults body needs respond with.
case, just going ignore right. fact, it’s almost sometimes good sign, hey,
stressing body stressed working amazing. fact,
don't see it’s sort like maybe not

02:15:07 Tool: “Acute State Shifters”, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones



Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

Enough push pace right, great. answer no peeking
phase, actually going use call acute State shifters. whole
host little tricks can change HRV recovery metric within seconds
again. not chronic fixes. just bad day today feel like crap.
Can make feel better right now, kind call parlor tricks lot
times thousand them. certainly not going go them, give
examples. Um can pull out. First all, physical movement, you'd,
stunned, just yoga moving around jumping jacks starting
workout. mean probably experienced this. It’s sort cliche world point,
um. ever serious lifting serious amount time, will days
walk gym feel awful somehow day said lifetime PR,
oud yeah. That’s strange strange phenomena! Yeah, uh! experienced
times um, it’s rare, inverse rare. However, feel great,
horrible workout, happens, yeah um, can happen number different
reasons. yeah, think former when, isn't feeling good
somehow terrific workout, set kind seed Doubt good
subjective assessments really are, guess talking um, objective
assessments, Yep like HRV remember, it’s single day uh can even hard
training, uh people sort idea like well. get recovery scores
lighter day, that’s probably can probably never making choice.
honest, not situation remember one bad day phase even
trying improve performance right now, like we're, probably still training hard, will
often see felt terrible trained super hard totally Changed day around
can happen. exercise first love here, absolutely breathing sort
upregulation breathing. talked lot regulation. Breathing just
opposite right, hyperventilation strategies can work instead
accentuating exhale, accentuate inhale restrict exhales.
working exact opposite situation. can also play little. things like
music motivational quotes type follows people Instagram motivate
can work things, um coaching tactics. can things like finding
talking person's. um sort shared something mantra use
training hard keep go better, not going ask share now,
people this. Sometimes right may conversation
athlete. call finding right finding like. Why? really here?
lot times hear things like it’s, grew poor


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

science [Music]


don't ever want poor again. Okay, great! children like
number things, can pull days. need really careful.
That’s call parlor tricks, play card often starts
lose effect right can dig whole often it’s sort like um
thing music right. every time go weight room, it’s blasting
death, metal level 10.. Well, eventually, it’s not! It’s no longer motivating right. It’s no
longer helpful, want deploy things strategically. Yeah. phrase
comes mind signal. noise - know nervous system, especially dopamine
system adrenaline system, part larger system, called
catecholamine system. that’s dopamine, epinephrine norepinephrine get
go focus external goals, movement Associated it’s that. system
responds best high signal relative noise. point out, um listening
music every time drinking, ton caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout nootropics
know stacking things uh sometimes refer dopamine stacking informally
referred dopamine stacking things. know first all,
wondering later afternoon next day, feeling like
cloud, it’s obvious you're, kind combine system crashed, it’s also
um, don't necessarily become dependent it. It’s just start wonder
whether not internal mechanisms motivation train without
things, someone tends use more, diminishing
effect time. rule um sort applying been. never two
workouts row stacking stimulants, loud music kind uh sort
high potency inspiration. However, every set gym, run, really try
diligent form attention one exception long
duration endurance work. Part reason work let mind go states
drifting, not trying think complete sentences even close it, just let brain
kind idle low hum uh, reason generally Listen something that’s
story don't listen anything just let thoughts kind spool anyway.
don't want take us far off track, think idea signal noise will resonate
engineers there, since people likely not Engineers, way
nervous system works evidenced fact that, whatever Area body right now
contact chair surface. That’s contact
seconds. forget it’s contact it, low signal noise.
point, similar note. actually mentioned stimulants, basically there, whether you're,
talking caffeine stimulant cortisol, modulators adaptogens.
things fall category not using consistently


rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

rough day sudden, throw 200 mL grams caffeine, it’s going
change real fast, strong performance, enhancing effect yeah absolutely,
reasons, Right mentioned couple them: breath work, um, food, calories, just
eating food, sometimes give people like call Comfort Foods.
just like: hey uh. know Georgia know love grits,
grits breakfast. Oh, great like just something change mood, acute
State, shifters um, alter it. couple Tricks light. know
maybe say, multiple people struggling day, maybe put lights extra bright,
bring extra things just get light not. doesn't even
count actually going outside seeing Sun. perhaps um
little tricks learned years uh. One particular thing love literally drawing
line, physical line ground, look line say like I'm, going
train today going accomplish effort. not going walk past line
training space ready give effort may take minute 10
whatever, it’s physical barrier important saying, like not just going get
it. going actually perform way want perform, not going
not going cross line ready make happen right. really like
tool. also brings mind importance least thinking relationship
phone training um Can perhaps help also impede workout motivation
performance. earlier episode, mentioned people using phone
play music workout, establish complete playlist prior initiating
workout not deviate playlist, opposed changing middle.
just much uh Impulse also check social media check, email,
check, text messages, mean way think phone. Actually it’s bunch little
brain areas? It’s got memory system you. It’s got. Look tables lookup tables. It’s
got websites look things Internet. It’s got photos mean rich sensory
data, it’s closely linked brain architecture. algorithms designed
way always think bringing second person me,
person twin, um severe attention issues already
attention issues just think this. twin compound tapping
shoulder talking time interrupting uh, somebody like lot,
that, frankly, um little bit irritating interrupting ability really
show also ability show them, started think phone
um entire individual represents certainly not better version
great exactly. actually mentioned something else will use uh, occasionally,
uh, call Brain Games puzzles, whether crossword puzzle


something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

something actually lose thought self second brain gets
engaged task weren't Regretting even thinking can stupid,
little games uh little challenges, especially in, like group team
setting right like going play one round dodgeball going play. One
round Thumb Wars, encourage yeah, see play like
thing. Instead warming like right get everyone, get going going to,
know, get foam roller, diamond. Whatever thing like right, everyone line
going play Thumb Wars see wins right, just like whatever right
sudden snapped new mental shift, um literally playing brain games playing
Tetris phone, like

02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training

things um can work acute setting. Can ask question: it’s not directly
related recovery uh per se, think it’s worth mentioning um asking rather,
use mirrors no mirrors, training um. know experience
seeing oneself observing one's form mirror. suppose utility. can
get sense progress might trigger um you're, almost specifically referring
resistance training. suppose cardio running treadmill pushing
sled something um can see form um. can get sense um. face
looks like Grimace uh, seriousness, um. without question
person, not Andy, um. One less interoceptive mode looking
mirror, extra reception, perception things beyond confines
skin. Even it’s picture us interception perception everything skin inward um,
looking ourselves, diverting allocation attention.
say: hundred: arbitrary units can, think, put 50 attention
feeling body muscles training 50 appears
mirror, 100 mirror 100 internally, best accomplish, probably
closing eyes, obviously constraints here, certain movements,
wouldn't want close eyes, Etc general. thoughts mirrors no
mirrors resistance training? Specifically, depends metric find
important, mean training say muscle, hypertrophy,
emerging evidence suggests uh actually looking mirror even
flexing sets, can actually advantageous. can augment muscle gains. Oh
uh support uh mirror, flexors, absolutely not not making fun you.


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause

months past thank joining today’s discussion fitness
exercise performance Dr Andy Galpin always thank interest
science [Music]


just uh. sort interesting observing side that, Hey, listen, results
people are. yeah, said that, trying enhance movement learning,
may detrimental, exercise explosive fast, it’s
probably not best thing looking mirror. walk Olympic
weightlifting Arena thoughts using mirror, probably run
gym quickly. can't see time make adjustment
movement. That’s happening fast also exactly mentioned,
will remove ability understand feel movement, big
component using technology exercise all. make sure end
point? understanding physiology more, not less Outsource
learning technology case, even technology mirror, remove
ability gain truly understand learning process. need very,
careful whether you're, using mirror whether using number apps,
can record, say movement watch afterwards, will give
breakdown. hand right spot right spot, great,
need take next step, say, need able feel position
right. So, case performance, can imagine trying learn new technique
say running technique, able watch mirror understand
stride right position. don't take next step saying. Okay, now don't
look mirror can feel getting rhythm whatever case
never able actually use race, it’s
important people pay attention dependent variable
actually interested trying get better something tech okay,

02:29:01 Tool: “Chronic State Shifters”

Starting place, just cannot finishing place. Thank Reflections,
curious happens one HRV reduced maybe three
four days row. Absolutely next question going ask
adaptation phase? so, going still ignore it. Just like single bad
day, going start watching carefully. may actually now introduce
tests, may use performance test uh may look something else. Maybe ask
questions: maybe communication either somebody else,
going start paying attention, still really not going take much action
crosses seven days consistent problems. peaking


phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use

phase, going go another set solutions truly going pull
hole rather just acute State shifters. call chronic
stage. Shifters now actually similar ones used before,
example thermal stress. can promise recovery score tanks
walk outside jump 35 degree water get back out. going
happen, HRV score immediately afterwards, talking within seconds going
significantly compromised right, words, think remember, low HRV
means High sympathetic. promise cold. Water will put high sympathetic Drive,
however, tested pretty extensively, looking HRV, zero, 15, 30, 60. 90,
way 180 minutes post average, will see HRV score continue
rise that, well. You'Ll, immediate sympathetic response? will
immediately respond. know 30 minutes people depends
person, though, score will improved several hours afterwards, heat can
kind similar effect. That, actually again, isn't sort acute fix, time
described earlier, can also little bit chronic effect. can also get
areas like sleep, now going start playing exploring.
sleeping poor well, sleep score? Fine, HRV low. That’s little bit
different answer. sleep getting compromised, going start going
making sure improving sleep terms like brain stuff, instead maybe
playing game music tricks, aren't going really
chronic Effect, can things like work social connection. That’s actually
shown improve uh recovery time. can things like journaling
meditation acute effect well chronic effect. again, go
Journal right now, probably feel better, also know time will gradually
improve things um adaptogens things like also can chronic effect. can
things like electrolytes food hydration? things off going
go whole number areas, primary ones outstanding that,
course, may simply time go back reassess training program that’s truly
case. that’s at, so, probably going either completely remove
training drop like 50 uh.

02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy

Start rebounding back Baseline that’s generally, numbers use many people
not training competitive sport maybe aren't pushing really


hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

hard. know maybe uh they're, consider themselves. Somebody exercises
order maintain Health, um Aesthetics Longevity, Etc uh, never really
finish workout, completely exhausted, sleeping okay, appetite's okay. Can
assume recovering well um maybe they're, not creating enough
adaptation response like there's, no Progressive overreaching really no
stimulus Recovery? saying face it, think, obvious
right. don't train hard, nothing recover really saying is:
ability recover something need train? words, can get better
recovering, uh analogy something like focus order perform work
kind, certainly mental work physical work. need able focus.
ability focus reflection bunch neural circuits chemicals hormones,
Etc. know roughly are, know poor focusing
every small bit time, can focus little bit longer. Even it’s matter seconds,
circuits get better focusing forth. words
recovery system. However, broad neurotransmitter hormones, neural muscular, immune
based, Etc. Can system set systems become better? Can get better
recovering meaning? Can become faster uh effective? Can think
recovery system kind blade gets sharper engaging recovery, so,
strong reason people not pushing really hard push least little
bit harder comfortable every once? make sure system
doesn't start slide back, remember, physiology listening everything
always responding. analogy will meet analogy use
bowling alley, probably bowling used bumper Lanes
right, bumper Lanes gone bowling spent time gutter
spent time pins, okay, um, it’s used bowling alley
town went um fun used slide around shoes like
all, kids hang Feel like still bowling alleys. don't even
know feels like something may gone way mid-2000s. don't care
no one bills anymore, not going ruin good analogy. Okay, intent wasn't
ruin! analogy: um, okay, tell us bowling. bowlers going come
um bowling balls something right. going get blasted
stats elevations cool in. one go bowling didn't want put
ball gutter yeah, put little bumpers Lanes right
little foam pads go gutter ball going towards gutter, hits
bounces off goes back lane right. Okay, entire conversation -
actually true lot way people approach, fitness health people


concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes

concerned oftentimes optimizing meaning. want make sure don't go
gutter. don't want hit walls. therefore, going try improve accuracy
throw ball, want make sure throwing center lane
often, want get disc, standard deviation Tighter Tighter,
don't get anywhere close hitting wall, however, not realizing is,
body will start shrinking size lane, basically says huh
haven't ball touch Us years. don't need wide, get smaller
smaller smaller. it’s not actually reduced ability recover,
start becoming incredibly sensitive that. two strategies enhancing recovery
practice getting closer throwing ball middle lane widen widen
alley that’s exactly referring to, absolutely that.
happens? don't precise doing,
ability handle many things widened. So, off now four five inches
right, no problem just tripled size alley, that’s exactly
want paying attention two things: number one getting better accuracy. Maybe
staying really tight progressions using nutrition sleep optimize recovery
push resilience call fact, actually biological way
measure resilience. folks. scientifically validated stuff. didn't
just make up. can actually measure resilience coming
this, that’s exactly term meant. well can handle bang things
off stressful? see reduction say 10 HRV today
might make feel terrible me, might not feel anything well adapted
large fluctuations therefore okay, less less.
responsive will slight deviations. exactly target. That’s kind
allude to, say got understand: optimizing for? optimizing
making sure don't feel different today. optimizing make sure
feel different? still able perform. want things like maybe use
caffeine today feel great, use every day, shrinking
sensitivity there. now, go day without it, can't train right. Caffeine
easy example, people understand whole system works,
really true everything else, yeah need practice way
give stress continue bring stress nutrition. training
breath work mentioned earlier Focus exact thing right: it’s not just
getting better right now, it’s training, system, can clearly train right. Um,
will often say breath. Work practice, that’s exactly talking right,
practicing getting better things, practicing returning focus,


practicing recovering quite literally physiologically. can regulate whether
talking enzymes, whether talking Regulators, will regulated.
then, next time insult comes it’s not big it’s not damaging yeah

02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery

Absolutely can, strive throughout episodes
talking exercise core word adaptations, love
mentioned breath. Work can also create adaptations. way visualizing
now resistance, training weights machines, body weight, otherwise,
cardiovascular training, running jogging, sprinting, jumping on. Thermal training,
exposure heat exposure cold dedicated way deliberate respiration, AKA,
breathing breath work practice. can viewed ways trigger
adaptations context recovery, specific adaptations trying engage
opposite stress, fact, exception perhaps deliberate cold exposure. Maybe
deliberate heat exposure, sauna really hot, can get dinorphine
release, kind uncomfortable, still cases, rebound that.
words, get shower, go bed next morning.
kind blissed feeling. know is. rebound
uncomfortable situation. seems doesn't really matter whether not using
resistance, cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches using
respiration based approaches. really ways triggering adaptations and,
applied properly, actually help recover stress create literal
result trying achieve people. might
obvious. think many people, including myself, set conversations
series, episodes - It’s really first time ever thought
exercise ways. event, it’s just reflection, it’s one that, least
um tremendously useful lot um organizational logic it, uh,
least appeals brain, things logic,
become simplified vast array tools uh becomes uh
becomes visible me. said earlier, it? Let make sure get right. It’s
um concepts methods many pretty close. Okay. remind us
state methods many Concepts. few. Ah, okay, either way directionality.
Probably doesn't matter. No, keep right. methods many uh concepts
um Galpin's law. science, not allowed name things um,


can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete
individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover

individual working or, you're, trying to, especially, you're, not trying lose
weight you're, trying maintenance that'll. Give insights well
moving past now, actually going move realm things call
Hidden stressors. visible, stressors, um, hidden stressors,
common ones, sort mentioned - probably um well going
ones serum. blood work cortisol like talked
testosterone course, testosterone, cortisone ratio ones
mentioned can quarterly. It’s not bad. blood markers
really no sense them. soon - markers mean
system - individuals getting pretty extensive blood work, saliva, work, urine stool,
plenty things just not need measure. know every 10


weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not
discussion episodes about, oftentimes can um serious
libido issues mentioned earlier, will emphasize more. need
cautious taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers.
reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find
really try just completely avoid decide. don't want try
fine too, really aren't ways predict. will respond? won't will
hyper

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close
last five days last six. Something like that, maybe cause
action. Well, incredible description various tools modes
recovery realized jumped gun bit discussion food
supplements, like think serves

can name uh things people, uh it’s Galpin's law, definitely
one created idea right. Absolutely extreme tremendous sarcasm

02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers

Sword Ultra right, regardless uh. go Galpin's law go one thing: that’s
head right now thrown lot options folks, maybe can
try simplify little bit. can kind walk measure
recovery, will often tools recommend people
not use everything. said want pick one two things per category
important you, cost availability interesting
important relevant you, reason kind wanted cover Large number
things give evokes options, want emphasize point not
measure them. fact, don't need um. ran professional
athletes, taken blood urine every single day. done performance
measures, uh vertical jumps force plate whole bunch things every day years
end can tell tremendous redundancy physiology right.
Everything Everything, don't need don't feel like missing out.
aren't them, one two metrics probably fine. generally recommend one
subjective measure. simple mood, feel today,
great one objective measure HRV resting heart rate? Anything else right, so,
even literally just you'd, probably pretty good insight so,
maybe fact go detail here. Um, maybe I'll, give couple examples things
measure every day. things measure, maybe quarterly monthly
maybe even annually, can maybe just pick couple
categories pretty good monitoring system.
include little bit Technology based others totally cost
free require nothing okay start off, recommend taking something like HRV
every day days. don't device like that, also use honestly
CO2 tolerance test, talked number times, probably
plenty resources go, find that, doesn't require anything. typically takes
minute so, can circumstances HRV,
words, time every day standardization stuff
actually coaching experience, um, while, admittedly, no Peer-Reviewed
research this, yet just experience tends track extremely closely HRV


metrics recovery. fact, actually pilot trial lab
attracted decently well state trade anxiety. it’s nice metric, not perfect,
take that. wanted, remember you're,
trying capture systemic stress you're, really just showing measuring one
thing two ways, don't necessarily both. will just
super interested small differences, globally going tell basically
thing, two things use again, basically daily year round
close it. want go past little bit um can look at, can use actual.
pretty old, commonly used survey called dalda d-a-l-d-a. forget exact acronym,
fairly lengthy questionnaire accounts things like feel today?
sleep, um, stressors, going life? eating -
like fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey came - mean Jesus - it’s probably
around 30 years something it’s nothing new used extensively.
not want every day, wanted take subjective measures every day
typically stick with, like said, mood, motivation, something like would.
perform test, though something like monthly end training
phase. know every couple months probably worth looking at: it’s not going tell
bad spot today tomorrow, pick HRV suit
autonomous test. would, though, tell information, especially working
another individual, major life changes anything, just facilitates
conversation right. noticed reported X, happening um. Let'S, talk
can help et cetera, another kind sneaky helpful one is, simply body fat? Like said,
um non-functional overreaching training associated number things
like energy appetite, suppression, changes body weight body composition.
can measure monthly even really quarterly uh, depending kind athlete

reasons. Right, didn't really sort get examples, just nailed another fantastic
reason it. not give things prophylactically. strongly discourage people
just walking around taking supplementation antioxidants, especially powerful ones, no
reason, done testing - good reason - fine
you're, specific, take training phase something like cool, just
walking around that, oftentimes not always oftentimes, causing
problems try solve. taking anti-inflammatories, feel
terrible low energy, little libido blah blah blah blah, inflamed, Etc. yeah


antioxidants form food fantastic, almost no issue. good evidence.
Actually don't worry man. shouldn't eat High antioxidant, rich foods,
going fine. talking Pharmaceuticals supplementation,
can take orders magnitude higher dosages quickly
presence food, distinction also important. Antioxidant rich foods
generally fine thus consumed totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations
powders, creams, drugs, Etc can get problems yeah. want
careful unless reason, don't unless uh, see
reason someone's markers, yeah herbal compounds. Despite fact
herbal can quite potent modulators hormones, um ashwagandha
example, two herbal compounds talked lot podcast
repeatedly, including testosterone, estrogen optimization episode, uh, Tongkat Ali
Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali now taken large number men women, um,
Tongkat Ali Fadogia Agrestis typically men. not sure good studies
effects Fadogia Agrestis women. herbal compounds can
potent effects increasing testosterone luteinizing hormone. work yeah?
work varying degrees in, everybody, not certainly not everybody um,
work, work potent effects. idea herbal
compounds not powerful um wrong, it’s important remember can cut
ways. Hence mention uh observation related turmeric, not say
people can't take turmeric feel perfectly fine, maintain even increase
libido, sure can happen. It’s just people DHT sensitive.
tends issue so, unfortunately, many compounds, way find

03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements

Responders um case it’s bit it’s little bit wild west, also sort
remembering point conversation supposed be, maybe return
back cost free low cost. Metrics, fun tangent,
nonetheless uh another couple ones can uh grip, strength testing.
can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
normal situation, can make decisions outside
see numbers consistently three five days row close

weeks case know cortisol, know, sort changes rapidly testosterone
can change pretty quickly, really trying notice large Trend, know,
certainly quarterly - appropriate time frame. every four five
weeks probably unnecessary, can save money
stuff. can look actually like semi-annually plasma like glutamine
glutamine glutamate ratio, can maybe save want look
another conversation, important um. always look something
oxidative stress thing. something like tnf alpha interleukin-6. Something
like looking serum looking that. know like semi-
annually another sneaky. Actually, one um love look uh neutrophil
lymphocyte ratio, will give pretty good insight. look
like fairly quarterly. number starts get really high, certainly like nine
one, got pretty good Insight something gnarly going immune
system, will actually take action much lower number. that’s like nice
cutoff see it’s like that’s very, high number. things can use
folks ability, hopefully get basic blood work done, get basic,
called CBC CMP um. great physician can get insurance cover
- just go ask CBC CMP know means, can
Google order get information. Typically, just
described close enough get insights can just use
free service. mentioned earlier check see

02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution

Whether not changes just matter testing quality actually physiologically
relevant, just described amazingly powerful array tools, hoping
can also mention tools either lower: cost, truly low cost zero cost that,
may not accuracy give complete picture biomarkers
tools mentioned can still provide reasonably reliable metrics
people can use order assess level recovery. Absolutely CO2 tolerance
test first one can just take metric anytime you'd, like
ones talked far. things like mood? haven't mentioned libido,
that’s another assessment people also tend pretty good grip know
feels normal. things go whack, tends pretty good signal
people will recognize yeah one note that: um, something came


episode uh hormones male female Health, point will Air,
know, no objective measure people terms libido across
board, meaning people vary tremendously: um age, life circumstances, um uh
um. one subjective measures think people need uh
sense critical Baseline really is, guessing time assess
might best initiating Midway relatively low intensity training phase
um. Maybe time year, factors um can influence libido,
not um maximum. think know, light dopamine
relationship testosterone estrogen systems, know libido uh,
testosterone, estrogen men women tends peak summer months. that’s
Baseline, you're, comparing don't know that’s reliable um thinking,
something like fall spring yeah um, anyway,
subjective, just encourage people recognize no standard numbers
no lookup table no equivalent libido BMI, LMI um, no
disrespect acronym probably LMI um. think it’s just something
keep mind people um comparisons subjective comparisons. don't pick
comparison extreme try pick comparison average, know
actually sort reminded me. One issue seen lot lately people
libido issues just even slightly noticing drop. just assume. then,
therefore means testosterone crashing things certainly connected.
not necessarily case becomes problem people go
things like trt, Etc, no true oversight kinds problems make sure
going take step actually get Testosterone, measured
working qualified person guide process, don't just assume
low energy libido little bit down, simply training
related, sleep related number things um. that’s like little bit
word caution. There, two quick points along lines just said. One
interesting thing learned researching episode testosterone estrogen
optimization. episode done time ago, still available
hubertlab.com formats, Etc. many people actually increase libido even
levels testosterone estrogen, progress 20s 40s
take excellent care themselves, including correct exercise, adaptations, correct body
fat lean lean muscle, uh ratios? course can go way too. lot
people can training achieve low body fat stores libido can suffer
know, age depend. Age-Related declines libido not necessarily written
script life. fact, data points really interesting paper. talk


episode uh individuals. study focused males 80s 90s,
maintained total free testosterone high individuals 20s. then,
look lifestyle factors people 80s 90s, lot
create scenario. second point one related just said: um,
true, people generally tend assume drop libido related drop
testosterone, um assume need increase testosterone.
cases true absolutely, it’s also often case people take estrogen
aromatase blockers, enzyme Inhibitors prevent conversion testosterone
estrogen experience severe deficits libido estrogen totally low. estrogen
blockers much issue um low testosterone. Then. final point also one
many people now men women um. think need aware
dihydrotestosterone DHT among powerful androgens power output. Physical
power output, also libido DHT strongly inhibited certain things like turmeric.
lot people taking high doses turmeric uh can experience drops libido
taking um various compounds prevent hair loss. Things like finasteride
whole catalog things can reduce libido not directly
testosterone pathway. can DHC related, estrogen related, this, think, points
importance yes. Take subjective measure libido pay. Attention essentially
aware: don't know, don't obsess aware try figure factors
um involved you, don't immediately assume needed
testosterone oftentimes um. opposite case. Yeah yeah try put lot
muscle no estrogen good luck right indeed lot um athletes particular uh.
know competitive bodybuilders know Saran Wrap thin skin. get
know people, talk them, can look like sort comic
book archetype um someone might might want be. mean that’s not

can buy know fairly cheap hand, grip dynamometer number places.
typically able purchased 20 40, something like right um. can


actually just test every day done uh number athletes decent amount
time, uh. Admittedly, don't anymore that’s not disagree it,
just getting information already just redundant.
that’s option, great one do. mentioned Also earlier actually like
speed tests strength tests earlier indication overreaching,
that. like vertical jump test. access force plate, that’s great,
can get in-depth characteristics force velocity curve acceleration, things
like used lot high performance situations. not simply looking know
performance, can kind go back one earlier episodes.
described coloring fingertips highlighters earlier life,
thing go garage every day jump touch marker see
um. system like done. can also use tools like uh Force,
transducer standard movement. can say vertical jump high pull
something like measure velocity just compare day-to-day standard
load right. every single time. load, um similar thing
done like medicine ball throw ball. throw thing
just sort today want little bit warm-up, not
excessive. want kind get idea Baseline don't want
influence veracity warm-up every single day, alone
changes thing stretching acute static, stretching directly influences power
production. don't want go one day 20 minute stretch
day didn't stretch all, alone will cause deviations
performance. try keep everything can think standardized that'll. Give
little bit better data remembering values, biomarkers, performance stuff.
normal variations. just want figure out, first foremost
normal variations you, normal number. standard
deviation start getting outside standard deviation, start paying attention,
that’s kind like typically call gray Zone, so, gray
Zone, fine not adjusting, it’s Outside that, whatever
recognizing grave zone smaller folks larger others.
