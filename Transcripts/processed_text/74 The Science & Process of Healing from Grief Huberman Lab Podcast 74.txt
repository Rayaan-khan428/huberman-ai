00:12:20 Stages Grief, Individual Variation Grieving

now conceptualize grief, treatments grief, people can move
effectively. wade important topic, like emphasize
common myths misunderstandings grief. myths
misunderstanding arrive beautiful work Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, psychologist
wrote famous book death dying. emphasize
Kubler-Ross real pioneer establishing indeed different stages
grief, modern science, psychology neuroscience, point fact not
everybody experiences stages Kubler-Ross defined, move
stages linear manner. Sometimes sequence. just
highlight five stages Kubler-Ross illustrated, people really
experience them, sometimes order read them. again, oftentimes
don't. different stages grief, quickly, denial, anger, bargaining,


depression, acceptance. Kubler-Ross model, denial always first stage,
denial just sounds, disbelief, cannot be, no way, refusal
accept new reality person animal gone. second stage, anger,
one individual recognizes person indeed gone, animal
gone, body mind go motivated state. important.
going return idea grief motivated state involves action plans,
depth go further. third stage bargaining, sometimes
called negotiating phase, idea that, well, just done this, just
done that, called more, somehow refusing accept reality. way
can blended denial thinking, "Well, just don't think it, won't
real," kind thing. again, stages can blended braided together,
emotions complex, right? Even though different stages process,
can sometimes melded together. fourth stage depression Kubler-
Ross described one of, go living? go living?
continue grief-stricken state seems deprive richness life
experienced person animal still here. fifth stage
acceptance. internalization, not just cognitively, not just thinking, emotionally
going okay, not just shall pass, passed.
again, five stages grief Kubler-Ross defined immensely important
critical parsing different stages one move through. unfortunately
five stages sort taken gospel long time. now know,
based neuroimaging, based in-depth psychological evaluation, frankly,
researchers clinicians moving area observing much
Kubler-Ross described hold true, not always case. fact,
contour grief process actually lot dimensions not encapsulated
five stages. also lot variation, depending whether not loss

think nowadays different frankly, better understanding

really understand grief brain body, best navigate grief,
like experiment me. next five minutes so, like

Imagine extremely thirsty, instance, hot day, glass water
right front you. beautiful, clean glass water, completely full,
badly want drink water. no matter intensely want it,
no matter hard try reach it, always shifts just outside reach.
can imagine that, even just little bit, touching experience grief.
know this? Well, know brain imaging studies involving called

dopamine puts us anticipatory state, state waiting something happen.
also puts us state action desiring action. body mind
like refer center mass forward. seeking resolve craving,
even know impossible. say that? Well, understand, also
basis brain imaging studies, also studies animals describe
moment, order understand grief, understand attachments
represented brain. turns attachments breaking
attachments healthy ways governed three important, call dimensions.
dimension just feature world represented brain.
instance, color red doesn't exist brain. happen cells, neurons,
eye respond best long wavelengths light. long wavelengths
light happen reflected off things perceived red.
mind, notion red. know little bit abstract, not actually
lighting red neurons brain, see red. lighting
neurons brain represent presence red things environment.
Similarly, neurons maps, say representations dimensions.
dimensions touch. dimensions sound. now teach you,
three dimensions define relationship people animals things.


people, animals things within immediate vicinity,
know access them, right? somebody's still alive, generally
way access them, unless refusing interact us. Well,
understand that, motivational states can operate way logical. know
that, instance, want find mother, brother, sister, significant other, dog, cat,
parrot, et cetera, go certain set steps.

00:23:15 Three Dimensions Relationships

three dimensions work? going
teach now. risk sounding little bit reductionist, now going
describe relationship anything, everything, anyone, three
dimensions. can that? even want that?
want rob complexity relationships contour detail? Well,
can understand dimensions map relationship people, animals,
things, can understand people, animals, things
not accessible us, hurts much, takes certain amount time
order re-understand, will, remap association them. promise
grasping information give you, will able better orient grief
process, able move effectively. three dimensions
relating someone, animal, thing, space, time, closeness.
order illustrate one work together support relationships
involvement grieving process, going tell experiment.
experiment actually done. experiment involves putting people brain
scanner allows researcher evaluate brain activity different areas. fact,
can look non-biased way, not make predictions brain areas
going involved. experiment following. person, say
research subject, first sees images things reside different distances
one another. say things, objects. one case beach
parking lot bowling balls set different distances one another. brain
imaged, brain imaged, see different pictures different scenes,
beach, parking lot, et cetera, bowling balls spaced different ways, close together,
far apart, regularly spaced, non-regularly spaced. one sort
experiment, see lot brain areas activated. Not surprisingly, visual cortex,


area brain responsible creating visual perceptions, also brain area
seems uniquely tuned distance objects. whether
not bowling balls far away close together one another, whether
not far away close physically, literally distance
objects. refer measure, dimension, call it, proximity,
okay? Whether not close you, high degree proximity, far away, low
proximity. simply physical space. subjects listened tones. tones
also spaced one another. something simple hand
meeting table top happen sitting front of. [hand hits].
image brain. course, areas brain associated auditory
perception active, not surprisingly, evaluate different types sounds
patterns sounds, instance, [hand hits] can start parse brain areas seem
uniquely tuned spacing sounds, independent sounds coming in.
whether not musical notes, hand hitting table, human speech,
identified brain region uniquely tuned. is, becomes active specifically
response changes spacing sounds, much way
identify brain regions activated changes
distance objects, bowling balls used previous example.
subjects saw different set images. images saw
people, faces. images saw people's faces right
close, images people distance, see whole
body person. Now, also varied emotional relationship people.
is, able get photographs research subjects' lives,
show pictures of, instance, sister random person off
street. show pictures parent, neighbor, celebrity
well known, somebody didn't know all. able vary
position person, close far, able vary emotional
distance person, dimension referring closeness,
not physical closeness, attached, well know somebody. Now,
maybe sounding like somewhat complicated experiment, takeaway
experiment exquisitely simple, exquisitely important. result was,
three conditions, changes physical spacing objects, changes
temporal, is, time spacing sounds, changes emotional
distance subject different people, brain area uniquely


activated. Now incredible thing find, suggests that, yes,
course brain areas associated representation visual objects,
yes, course brain areas associated representation different
sounds. course, brain areas associated faces. now know this.
fact, something called fusiform face area, uniquely tuned faces.
time, unique brain region activated three
conditions described, far somebody,
space, time, terms emotional closeness. brain area, turns out,
brain area called inferior parietal lobule, inferior parietal lobule. Now, don't
need know inferior parietal lobule is.

00:29:52 Tool: Remapping Relationships

fact, don't even need know name brain area. need

00:12:20 Stages Grief, Individual Variation Grieving

now conceptualize grief, treatments grief, people can move
effectively. wade important topic, like emphasize
common myths misunderstandings grief. myths
misunderstanding arrive beautiful work Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, psychologist
wrote famous book death dying. emphasize
Kubler-Ross real pioneer establishing indeed different stages
grief, modern science, psychology neuroscience, point fact not
everybody experiences stages Kubler-Ross defined, move
stages linear manner. Sometimes sequence. just
highlight five stages Kubler-Ross illustrated, people really
experience them, sometimes order read them. again, oftentimes
don't. different stages grief, quickly, denial, anger, bargaining,


depression, acceptance. Kubler-Ross model, denial always first stage,
denial just sounds, disbelief, cannot be, no way, refusal
accept new reality person animal gone. second stage, anger,
one individual recognizes person indeed gone, animal
gone, body mind go motivated state. important.
going return idea grief motivated state involves action plans,
depth go further. third stage bargaining, sometimes
called negotiating phase, idea that, well, just done this, just
done that, called more, somehow refusing accept reality. way
can blended denial thinking, "Well, just don't think it, won't
real," kind thing. again, stages can blended braided together,
emotions complex, right? Even though different stages process,
can sometimes melded together. fourth stage depression Kubler-
Ross described one of, go living? go living?
continue grief-stricken state seems deprive richness life
experienced person animal still here. fifth stage
acceptance. internalization, not just cognitively, not just thinking, emotionally
going okay, not just shall pass, passed.
again, five stages grief Kubler-Ross defined immensely important
critical parsing different stages one move through. unfortunately
five stages sort taken gospel long time. now know,
based neuroimaging, based in-depth psychological evaluation, frankly,
researchers clinicians moving area observing much
Kubler-Ross described hold true, not always case. fact,
contour grief process actually lot dimensions not encapsulated
five stages. also lot variation, depending whether not loss
due old age, disease, whether not suffering prior not, suicide non-
suicide type deaths losses, even grief non-death losses, relationship
breakup, something sort, even homesickness things sort.
want tip hats incredible work Elisabeth Kubler-Ross. no means
researchers try discount incredible contributions.

00:16:05 Grief: Lack & Motivation, Dopamine



think nowadays different frankly, better understanding
grief process like, consequence, better tools move grief. order
really understand grief brain body, best navigate grief,
like experiment me. next five minutes so, like
least try discard prior notions grief just state sadness. want
acknowledge involve sadness, right now, think grief
motivational state, desire something specific. fact, like think
grief attempt reach get something much want.
Imagine extremely thirsty, instance, hot day, glass water
right front you. beautiful, clean glass water, completely full,
badly want drink water. no matter intensely want it,
no matter hard try reach it, always shifts just outside reach.
can imagine that, even just little bit, touching experience grief.
know this? Well, know brain imaging studies involving called
functional magnetic resonance imaging, FMRI, can evaluate brain
areas active others, according blood flow, correlates neural
activity forth, teaches us brain areas associated motivation
craving pursuit primary brain areas circuits
activated states grief. like share important paper you, one
first illustrate fact grief not just state sadness pain. indeed
state yearning desire something just outside reach,
unfortunately will always just outside reach remap relationship
person thing. title paper posed first question,
read such. title "Craving Love? Enduring Grief Activates Brain's Reward
Center." first author paper Mary-Frances O'Connor. professor
psychology University Arizona, one world leaders study
grief neuroscience perspective. luck, get podcast
guest. Now paper several important features. just highlight few. One
features paper not surprising found people
state grief state pain. is, brain areas associated pain, actual
physical pain, active non-grieving individuals. However, also found
people experiencing called complicated grief showed reward-related
activity brain area called nucleus accumbens. reward-related activity?
Reward-related activity activity neurons associated motivational states.


nucleus accumbens brain center dopamine effect
creating motivated state. ever thought dopamine associated
feeling good, hear dopamine hits, well, paper papers like it, firmly tell
us dopamine not feeling good. Dopamine placing us state
desiring things seeking things. true addiction. true

state reaching something outside immediate ability give

move grief. Grief not just sadness. state sadness,
hence activation brain areas associated pain, state desire
reaching something. experienced grief, think will
resonate you. understanding grief state pain, also state
wanting, understanding lose somebody, either
breakup death, animal dies gets taken away missing,
state wanting desire drives activation state within us. Now, key thing
understand activation reward centers, involvement
dopamine puts us anticipatory state, state waiting something happen.
also puts us state action desiring action. body mind
like refer center mass forward. seeking resolve craving,
even know impossible. say that? Well, understand, also
basis brain imaging studies, also studies animals describe
moment, order understand grief, understand attachments
represented brain. turns attachments breaking
attachments healthy ways governed three important, call dimensions.
dimension just feature world represented brain.
instance, color red doesn't exist brain. happen cells, neurons,
eye respond best long wavelengths light. long wavelengths
light happen reflected off things perceived red.
mind, notion red. know little bit abstract, not actually
lighting red neurons brain, see red. lighting
neurons brain represent presence red things environment.
Similarly, neurons maps, say representations dimensions.
dimensions touch. dimensions sound. now teach you,
three dimensions define relationship people animals things.


people, animals things within immediate vicinity,
know access them, right? somebody's still alive, generally
way access them, unless refusing interact us. Well,
understand that, motivational states can operate way logical. know
that, instance, want find mother, brother, sister, significant other, dog, cat,
parrot, et cetera, go certain set steps.

00:23:15 Three Dimensions Relationships

three dimensions work? going
teach now. risk sounding little bit reductionist, now going
describe relationship anything, everything, anyone, three
dimensions. can that? even want that?
want rob complexity relationships contour detail? Well,
can understand dimensions map relationship people, animals,
things, can understand people, animals, things
not accessible us, hurts much, takes certain amount time
order re-understand, will, remap association them. promise
grasping information give you, will able better orient grief
process, able move effectively. three dimensions
relating someone, animal, thing, space, time, closeness.
order illustrate one work together support relationships
involvement grieving process, going tell experiment.
experiment actually done. experiment involves putting people brain
scanner allows researcher evaluate brain activity different areas. fact,
can look non-biased way, not make predictions brain areas
going involved. experiment following. person, say
research subject, first sees images things reside different distances
one another. say things, objects. one case beach
parking lot bowling balls set different distances one another. brain
imaged, brain imaged, see different pictures different scenes,
beach, parking lot, et cetera, bowling balls spaced different ways, close together,
far apart, regularly spaced, non-regularly spaced. one sort
experiment, see lot brain areas activated. Not surprisingly, visual cortex,


area brain responsible creating visual perceptions, also brain area
seems uniquely tuned distance objects. whether
not bowling balls far away close together one another, whether
not far away close physically, literally distance
objects. refer measure, dimension, call it, proximity,
okay? Whether not close you, high degree proximity, far away, low
proximity. simply physical space. subjects listened tones. tones
also spaced one another. something simple hand
meeting table top happen sitting front of. [hand hits].
image brain. course, areas brain associated auditory
perception active, not surprisingly, evaluate different types sounds
patterns sounds, instance, [hand hits] can start parse brain areas seem
uniquely tuned spacing sounds, independent sounds coming in.
whether not musical notes, hand hitting table, human speech,
identified brain region uniquely tuned. is, becomes active specifically
response changes spacing sounds, much way
identify brain regions activated changes
distance objects, bowling balls used previous example.
subjects saw different set images. images saw
people, faces. images saw people's faces right
close, images people distance, see whole
body person. Now, also varied emotional relationship people.
is, able get photographs research subjects' lives,
show pictures of, instance, sister random person off
street. show pictures parent, neighbor, celebrity
well known, somebody didn't know all. able vary
position person, close far, able vary emotional
distance person, dimension referring closeness,
not physical closeness, attached, well know somebody. Now,
maybe sounding like somewhat complicated experiment, takeaway
experiment exquisitely simple, exquisitely important. result was,
three conditions, changes physical spacing objects, changes
temporal, is, time spacing sounds, changes emotional
distance subject different people, brain area uniquely


activated. Now incredible thing find, suggests that, yes,
course brain areas associated representation visual objects,
yes, course brain areas associated representation different
sounds. course, brain areas associated faces. now know this.
fact, something called fusiform face area, uniquely tuned faces.
time, unique brain region activated three
conditions described, far somebody,
space, time, terms emotional closeness. brain area, turns out,
brain area called inferior parietal lobule, inferior parietal lobule. Now, don't
need know inferior parietal lobule is.

00:29:52 Tool: Remapping Relationships

fact, don't even need know name brain area. need
know, however, want understand grief move grief,
map people not map emotional closeness per se. map emotional

00:12:20 Stages Grief, Individual Variation Grieving

now conceptualize grief, treatments grief, people can move
effectively. wade important topic, like emphasize
common myths misunderstandings grief. myths

wrote famous book death dying. emphasize
Kubler-Ross real pioneer establishing indeed different stages
grief, modern science, psychology neuroscience, point fact not
everybody experiences stages Kubler-Ross defined, move
stages linear manner. Sometimes sequence. just
highlight five stages Kubler-Ross illustrated, people really
experience them, sometimes order read them. again, oftentimes
don't. different stages grief, quickly, denial, anger, bargaining,


depression, acceptance. Kubler-Ross model, denial always first stage,
denial just sounds, disbelief, cannot be, no way, refusal
accept new reality person animal gone. second stage, anger,
one individual recognizes person indeed gone, animal
gone, body mind go motivated state. important.
going return idea grief motivated state involves action plans,
depth go further. third stage bargaining, sometimes
called negotiating phase, idea that, well, just done this, just
done that, called more, somehow refusing accept reality. way
can blended denial thinking, "Well, just don't think it, won't
real," kind thing. again, stages can blended braided together,
emotions complex, right? Even though different stages process,
can sometimes melded together. fourth stage depression Kubler-
Ross described one of, go living? go living?
continue grief-stricken state seems deprive richness life
experienced person animal still here. fifth stage
acceptance. internalization, not just cognitively, not just thinking, emotionally
going okay, not just shall pass, passed.
again, five stages grief Kubler-Ross defined immensely important
critical parsing different stages one move through. unfortunately
five stages sort taken gospel long time. now know,
based neuroimaging, based in-depth psychological evaluation, frankly,
researchers clinicians moving area observing much
Kubler-Ross described hold true, not always case. fact,
contour grief process actually lot dimensions not encapsulated
five stages. also lot variation, depending whether not loss
due old age, disease, whether not suffering prior not, suicide non-
suicide type deaths losses, even grief non-death losses, relationship
breakup, something sort, even homesickness things sort.
want tip hats incredible work Elisabeth Kubler-Ross. no means
researchers try discount incredible contributions.

00:16:05 Grief: Lack & Motivation, Dopamine



think nowadays different frankly, better understanding

really understand grief brain body, best navigate grief,
like experiment me. next five minutes so, like

Imagine extremely thirsty, instance, hot day, glass water
right front you. beautiful, clean glass water, completely full,
badly want drink water. no matter intensely want it,
no matter hard try reach it, always shifts just outside reach.
can imagine that, even just little bit, touching experience grief.
know this? Well, know brain imaging studies involving called

understand activation reward centers, involvement
dopamine puts us anticipatory state, state waiting something happen.
also puts us state action desiring action. body mind
like refer center mass forward. seeking resolve craving,
even know impossible. say that? Well, understand, also
basis brain imaging studies, also studies animals describe
moment, order understand grief, understand attachments
represented brain. turns attachments breaking
attachments healthy ways governed three important, call dimensions.
dimension just feature world represented brain.
instance, color red doesn't exist brain. happen cells, neurons,
eye respond best long wavelengths light. long wavelengths
light happen reflected off things perceived red.
mind, notion red. know little bit abstract, not actually
lighting red neurons brain, see red. lighting
neurons brain represent presence red things environment.
Similarly, neurons maps, say representations dimensions.
dimensions touch. dimensions sound. now teach you,
three dimensions define relationship people animals things.


people, animals things within immediate vicinity,
know access them, right? somebody's still alive, generally
way access them, unless refusing interact us. Well,
understand that, motivational states can operate way logical. know
that, instance, want find mother, brother, sister, significant other, dog, cat,
parrot, et cetera, go certain set steps.

00:23:15 Three Dimensions Relationships

three dimensions work? going
teach now. risk sounding little bit reductionist, now going
describe relationship anything, everything, anyone, three
dimensions. can that? even want that?
want rob complexity relationships contour detail? Well,
can understand dimensions map relationship people, animals,
things, can understand people, animals, things
not accessible us, hurts much, takes certain amount time
order re-understand, will, remap association them. promise
grasping information give you, will able better orient grief
process, able move effectively. three dimensions
relating someone, animal, thing, space, time, closeness.
order illustrate one work together support relationships
involvement grieving process, going tell experiment.
experiment actually done. experiment involves putting people brain
scanner allows researcher evaluate brain activity different areas. fact,
can look non-biased way, not make predictions brain areas
going involved. experiment following. person, say
research subject, first sees images things reside different distances
one another. say things, objects. one case beach
parking lot bowling balls set different distances one another. brain
imaged, brain imaged, see different pictures different scenes,
beach, parking lot, et cetera, bowling balls spaced different ways, close together,
far apart, regularly spaced, non-regularly spaced. one sort
experiment, see lot brain areas activated. Not surprisingly, visual cortex,


area brain responsible creating visual perceptions, also brain area
seems uniquely tuned distance objects. whether
not bowling balls far away close together one another, whether
not far away close physically, literally distance
objects. refer measure, dimension, call it, proximity,
okay? Whether not close you, high degree proximity, far away, low
proximity. simply physical space. subjects listened tones. tones
also spaced one another. something simple hand

image brain. course, areas brain associated auditory
perception active, not surprisingly, evaluate different types sounds
patterns sounds, instance, [hand hits] can start parse brain areas seem
uniquely tuned spacing sounds, independent sounds coming in.
whether not musical notes, hand hitting table, human speech,

subjects saw different set images. images saw
people, faces. images saw people's faces right
close, images people distance, see whole
body person. Now, also varied emotional relationship people.
is, able get photographs research subjects' lives,
show pictures of, instance, sister random person off
street. show pictures parent, neighbor, celebrity
well known, somebody didn't know all. able vary
position person, close far, able vary emotional
distance person, dimension referring closeness,
not physical closeness, attached, well know somebody. Now,
maybe sounding like somewhat complicated experiment, takeaway
experiment exquisitely simple, exquisitely important. result was,
three conditions, changes physical spacing objects, changes
temporal, is, time spacing sounds, changes emotional
distance subject different people, brain area uniquely


activated. Now incredible thing find, suggests that, yes,
course brain areas associated representation visual objects,
yes, course brain areas associated representation different
sounds. course, brain areas associated faces. now know this.
fact, something called fusiform face area, uniquely tuned faces.
time, unique brain region activated three
conditions described, far somebody,

brain area called inferior parietal lobule, inferior parietal lobule. Now, don't
need know inferior parietal lobule is.

Along lines, want point grief depression, can feel quite

00:12:20 Stages Grief, Individual Variation Grieving

now conceptualize grief, treatments grief, people can move
effectively. wade important topic, like emphasize
common myths misunderstandings grief. myths
misunderstanding arrive beautiful work Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, psychologist
wrote famous book death dying. emphasize
Kubler-Ross real pioneer establishing indeed different stages
grief, modern science, psychology neuroscience, point fact not
everybody experiences stages Kubler-Ross defined, move
stages linear manner. Sometimes sequence. just
highlight five stages Kubler-Ross illustrated, people really
experience them, sometimes order read them. again, oftentimes
don't. different stages grief, quickly, denial, anger, bargaining,


depression, acceptance. Kubler-Ross model, denial always first stage,
denial just sounds, disbelief, cannot be, no way, refusal
accept new reality person animal gone. second stage, anger,
one individual recognizes person indeed gone, animal
gone, body mind go motivated state. important.
going return idea grief motivated state involves action plans,
depth go further. third stage bargaining, sometimes
called negotiating phase, idea that, well, just done this, just
done that, called more, somehow refusing accept reality. way
can blended denial thinking, "Well, just don't think it, won't
real," kind thing. again, stages can blended braided together,
emotions complex, right? Even though different stages process,
can sometimes melded together. fourth stage depression Kubler-
Ross described one of, go living? go living?
continue grief-stricken state seems deprive richness life
experienced person animal still here. fifth stage
acceptance. internalization, not just cognitively, not just thinking, emotionally
going okay, not just shall pass, passed.
again, five stages grief Kubler-Ross defined immensely important
critical parsing different stages one move through. unfortunately
five stages sort taken gospel long time. now know,
based neuroimaging, based in-depth psychological evaluation, frankly,
researchers clinicians moving area observing much
Kubler-Ross described hold true, not always case. fact,
contour grief process actually lot dimensions not encapsulated
five stages. also lot variation, depending whether not loss
due old age, disease, whether not suffering prior not, suicide non-
suicide type deaths losses, even grief non-death losses, relationship
breakup, something sort, even homesickness things sort.
want tip hats incredible work Elisabeth Kubler-Ross. no means
researchers try discount incredible contributions.

00:16:05 Grief: Lack & Motivation, Dopamine



think nowadays different frankly, better understanding
grief process like, consequence, better tools move grief. order
really understand grief brain body, best navigate grief,
like experiment me. next five minutes so, like
least try discard prior notions grief just state sadness. want
acknowledge involve sadness, right now, think grief
motivational state, desire something specific. fact, like think
grief attempt reach get something much want.
Imagine extremely thirsty, instance, hot day, glass water
right front you. beautiful, clean glass water, completely full,
badly want drink water. no matter intensely want it,
no matter hard try reach it, always shifts just outside reach.
can imagine that, even just little bit, touching experience grief.
know this? Well, know brain imaging studies involving called
functional magnetic resonance imaging, FMRI, can evaluate brain
areas active others, according blood flow, correlates neural
activity forth, teaches us brain areas associated motivation
craving pursuit primary brain areas circuits
activated states grief. like share important paper you, one
first illustrate fact grief not just state sadness pain. indeed
state yearning desire something just outside reach,
unfortunately will always just outside reach remap relationship

guest. Now paper several important features. just highlight few. One
features paper not surprising found people
state grief state pain. is, brain areas associated pain, actual
physical pain, active non-grieving individuals. However, also found
people experiencing called complicated grief showed reward-related
activity brain area called nucleus accumbens. reward-related activity?
Reward-related activity activity neurons associated motivational states.

us dopamine not feeling good. Dopamine placing us state

hence activation brain areas associated pain, state desire

resonate you. understanding grief state pain, also state
wanting, understanding lose somebody, either
breakup death, animal dies gets taken away missing,
state wanting desire drives activation state within us. Now, key thing
understand activation reward centers, involvement
dopamine puts us anticipatory state, state waiting something happen.
also puts us state action desiring action. body mind
like refer center mass forward. seeking resolve craving,
even know impossible. say that? Well, understand, also
basis brain imaging studies, also studies animals describe
moment, order understand grief, understand attachments
represented brain. turns attachments breaking
attachments healthy ways governed three important, call dimensions.
dimension just feature world represented brain.
instance, color red doesn't exist brain. happen cells, neurons,
eye respond best long wavelengths light. long wavelengths
light happen reflected off things perceived red.
mind, notion red. know little bit abstract, not actually
lighting red neurons brain, see red. lighting
neurons brain represent presence red things environment.
Similarly, neurons maps, say representations dimensions.
dimensions touch. dimensions sound. now teach you,
three dimensions define relationship people animals things.


people, animals things within immediate vicinity,
know access them, right? somebody's still alive, generally
way access them, unless refusing interact us. Well,
understand that, motivational states can operate way logical. know
that, instance, want find mother, brother, sister, significant other, dog, cat,
parrot, et cetera, go certain set steps.

00:23:15 Three Dimensions Relationships

three dimensions work? going
teach now. risk sounding little bit reductionist, now going
describe relationship anything, everything, anyone, three
dimensions. can that? even want that?
want rob complexity relationships contour detail? Well,
can understand dimensions map relationship people, animals,
things, can understand people, animals, things
not accessible us, hurts much, takes certain amount time
order re-understand, will, remap association them. promise
grasping information give you, will able better orient grief
process, able move effectively. three dimensions
relating someone, animal, thing, space, time, closeness.
order illustrate one work together support relationships
involvement grieving process, going tell experiment.
experiment actually done. experiment involves putting people brain
scanner allows researcher evaluate brain activity different areas. fact,
can look non-biased way, not make predictions brain areas
going involved. experiment following. person, say
research subject, first sees images things reside different distances
one another. say things, objects. one case beach
parking lot bowling balls set different distances one another. brain
imaged, brain imaged, see different pictures different scenes,
beach, parking lot, et cetera, bowling balls spaced different ways, close together,
far apart, regularly spaced, non-regularly spaced. one sort
experiment, see lot brain areas activated. Not surprisingly, visual cortex,


area brain responsible creating visual perceptions, also brain area
seems uniquely tuned distance objects. whether
not bowling balls far away close together one another, whether
not far away close physically, literally distance
objects. refer measure, dimension, call it, proximity,
okay? Whether not close you, high degree proximity, far away, low
proximity. simply physical space. subjects listened tones. tones
also spaced one another. something simple hand
meeting table top happen sitting front of. [hand hits].
image brain. course, areas brain associated auditory
perception active, not surprisingly, evaluate different types sounds
patterns sounds, instance, [hand hits] can start parse brain areas seem
uniquely tuned spacing sounds, independent sounds coming in.
whether not musical notes, hand hitting table, human speech,
identified brain region uniquely tuned. is, becomes active specifically
response changes spacing sounds, much way
identify brain regions activated changes
distance objects, bowling balls used previous example.
subjects saw different set images. images saw
people, faces. images saw people's faces right
close, images people distance, see whole
body person. Now, also varied emotional relationship people.
is, able get photographs research subjects' lives,
show pictures of, instance, sister random person off
street. show pictures parent, neighbor, celebrity
well known, somebody didn't know all. able vary
position person, close far, able vary emotional
distance person, dimension referring closeness,
not physical closeness, attached, well know somebody. Now,
maybe sounding like somewhat complicated experiment, takeaway
experiment exquisitely simple, exquisitely important. result was,
three conditions, changes physical spacing objects, changes
temporal, is, time spacing sounds, changes emotional
distance subject different people, brain area uniquely


activated. Now incredible thing find, suggests that, yes,
course brain areas associated representation visual objects,
yes, course brain areas associated representation different
sounds. course, brain areas associated faces. now know this.
fact, something called fusiform face area, uniquely tuned faces.
time, unique brain region activated three
conditions described, far somebody,

brain area called inferior parietal lobule, inferior parietal lobule. Now, don't
need know inferior parietal lobule is.

00:29:52 Tool: Remapping Relationships

fact, don't even need know name brain area. need

00:16:05 Grief: Lack & Motivation, Dopamine



think nowadays different frankly, better understanding

really understand grief brain body, best navigate grief,
like experiment me. next five minutes so, like
least try discard prior notions grief just state sadness. want

grief attempt reach get something much want.
Imagine extremely thirsty, instance, hot day, glass water
right front you. beautiful, clean glass water, completely full,
badly want drink water. no matter intensely want it,
no matter hard try reach it, always shifts just outside reach.
can imagine that, even just little bit, touching experience grief.
know this? Well, know brain imaging studies involving called

guest. Now paper several important features. just highlight few. One
features paper not surprising found people
state grief state pain. is, brain areas associated pain, actual
physical pain, active non-grieving individuals. However, also found
people experiencing called complicated grief showed reward-related
activity brain area called nucleus accumbens. reward-related activity?
Reward-related activity activity neurons associated motivational states.

understand activation reward centers, involvement
dopamine puts us anticipatory state, state waiting something happen.
also puts us state action desiring action. body mind
like refer center mass forward. seeking resolve craving,
even know impossible. say that? Well, understand, also
basis brain imaging studies, also studies animals describe
moment, order understand grief, understand attachments
represented brain. turns attachments breaking
attachments healthy ways governed three important, call dimensions.
dimension just feature world represented brain.
instance, color red doesn't exist brain. happen cells, neurons,
eye respond best long wavelengths light. long wavelengths
light happen reflected off things perceived red.
mind, notion red. know little bit abstract, not actually
lighting red neurons brain, see red. lighting
neurons brain represent presence red things environment.
Similarly, neurons maps, say representations dimensions.
dimensions touch. dimensions sound. now teach you,
three dimensions define relationship people animals things.


people, animals things within immediate vicinity,
know access them, right? somebody's still alive, generally
way access them, unless refusing interact us. Well,
understand that, motivational states can operate way logical. know
that, instance, want find mother, brother, sister, significant other, dog, cat,
parrot, et cetera, go certain set steps.

00:23:15 Three Dimensions Relationships

three dimensions work? going
teach now. risk sounding little bit reductionist, now going
describe relationship anything, everything, anyone, three
dimensions. can that? even want that?
want rob complexity relationships contour detail? Well,
can understand dimensions map relationship people, animals,
things, can understand people, animals, things
not accessible us, hurts much, takes certain amount time
order re-understand, will, remap association them. promise
grasping information give you, will able better orient grief
process, able move effectively. three dimensions
relating someone, animal, thing, space, time, closeness.
order illustrate one work together support relationships
involvement grieving process, going tell experiment.
experiment actually done. experiment involves putting people brain
scanner allows researcher evaluate brain activity different areas. fact,
can look non-biased way, not make predictions brain areas
going involved. experiment following. person, say
research subject, first sees images things reside different distances
one another. say things, objects. one case beach
parking lot bowling balls set different distances one another. brain
imaged, brain imaged, see different pictures different scenes,
beach, parking lot, et cetera, bowling balls spaced different ways, close together,
far apart, regularly spaced, non-regularly spaced. one sort
experiment, see lot brain areas activated. Not surprisingly, visual cortex,


area brain responsible creating visual perceptions, also brain area
seems uniquely tuned distance objects. whether
not bowling balls far away close together one another, whether
not far away close physically, literally distance
objects. refer measure, dimension, call it, proximity,
okay? Whether not close you, high degree proximity, far away, low
proximity. simply physical space. subjects listened tones. tones
also spaced one another. something simple hand
meeting table top happen sitting front of. [hand hits].
image brain. course, areas brain associated auditory
perception active, not surprisingly, evaluate different types sounds
patterns sounds, instance, [hand hits] can start parse brain areas seem
uniquely tuned spacing sounds, independent sounds coming in.
whether not musical notes, hand hitting table, human speech,
identified brain region uniquely tuned. is, becomes active specifically
response changes spacing sounds, much way
identify brain regions activated changes
distance objects, bowling balls used previous example.
subjects saw different set images. images saw
people, faces. images saw people's faces right
close, images people distance, see whole
body person. Now, also varied emotional relationship people.
is, able get photographs research subjects' lives,
show pictures of, instance, sister random person off
street. show pictures parent, neighbor, celebrity
well known, somebody didn't know all. able vary
position person, close far, able vary emotional
distance person, dimension referring closeness,
not physical closeness, attached, well know somebody. Now,
maybe sounding like somewhat complicated experiment, takeaway
experiment exquisitely simple, exquisitely important. result was,
three conditions, changes physical spacing objects, changes
temporal, is, time spacing sounds, changes emotional
distance subject different people, brain area uniquely


activated. Now incredible thing find, suggests that, yes,
course brain areas associated representation visual objects,
yes, course brain areas associated representation different
sounds. course, brain areas associated faces. now know this.
fact, something called fusiform face area, uniquely tuned faces.
time, unique brain region activated three
conditions described, far somebody,
space, time, terms emotional closeness. brain area, turns out,
brain area called inferior parietal lobule, inferior parietal lobule. Now, don't
need know inferior parietal lobule is.

00:29:52 Tool: Remapping Relationships

think nowadays different frankly, better understanding

really understand grief brain body, best navigate grief,
like experiment me. next five minutes so, like
least try discard prior notions grief just state sadness. want
acknowledge involve sadness, right now, think grief
motivational state, desire something specific. fact, like think
grief attempt reach get something much want.
Imagine extremely thirsty, instance, hot day, glass water
right front you. beautiful, clean glass water, completely full,
badly want drink water. no matter intensely want it,
no matter hard try reach it, always shifts just outside reach.
can imagine that, even just little bit, touching experience grief.
know this? Well, know brain imaging studies involving called
functional magnetic resonance imaging, FMRI, can evaluate brain
areas active others, according blood flow, correlates neural

features paper not surprising found people
state grief state pain. is, brain areas associated pain, actual
physical pain, active non-grieving individuals. However, also found
people experiencing called complicated grief showed reward-related
activity brain area called nucleus accumbens. reward-related activity?
Reward-related activity activity neurons associated motivational states.

resonate you. understanding grief state pain, also state
wanting, understanding lose somebody, either
breakup death, animal dies gets taken away missing,
state wanting desire drives activation state within us. Now, key thing
understand activation reward centers, involvement
dopamine puts us anticipatory state, state waiting something happen.
also puts us state action desiring action. body mind
like refer center mass forward. seeking resolve craving,
even know impossible. say that? Well, understand, also
basis brain imaging studies, also studies animals describe
moment, order understand grief, understand attachments
represented brain. turns attachments breaking
attachments healthy ways governed three important, call dimensions.
dimension just feature world represented brain.
instance, color red doesn't exist brain. happen cells, neurons,
eye respond best long wavelengths light. long wavelengths
light happen reflected off things perceived red.
mind, notion red. know little bit abstract, not actually
lighting red neurons brain, see red. lighting
neurons brain represent presence red things environment.
Similarly, neurons maps, say representations dimensions.
dimensions touch. dimensions sound. now teach you,
three dimensions define relationship people animals things.


people, animals things within immediate vicinity,
know access them, right? somebody's still alive, generally
way access them, unless refusing interact us. Well,
understand that, motivational states can operate way logical. know
that, instance, want find mother, brother, sister, significant other, dog, cat,
parrot, et cetera, go certain set steps.

00:23:15 Three Dimensions Relationships

three dimensions work? going
teach now. risk sounding little bit reductionist, now going
describe relationship anything, everything, anyone, three
dimensions. can that? even want that?
want rob complexity relationships contour detail? Well,
can understand dimensions map relationship people, animals,
things, can understand people, animals, things
not accessible us, hurts much, takes certain amount time
order re-understand, will, remap association them. promise
grasping information give you, will able better orient grief
process, able move effectively. three dimensions
relating someone, animal, thing, space, time, closeness.
order illustrate one work together support relationships
involvement grieving process, going tell experiment.
experiment actually done. experiment involves putting people brain
scanner allows researcher evaluate brain activity different areas. fact,
can look non-biased way, not make predictions brain areas
going involved. experiment following. person, say
research subject, first sees images things reside different distances
one another. say things, objects. one case beach
parking lot bowling balls set different distances one another. brain
imaged, brain imaged, see different pictures different scenes,
beach, parking lot, et cetera, bowling balls spaced different ways, close together,
far apart, regularly spaced, non-regularly spaced. one sort
experiment, see lot brain areas activated. Not surprisingly, visual cortex,


area brain responsible creating visual perceptions, also brain area
seems uniquely tuned distance objects. whether
not bowling balls far away close together one another, whether
not far away close physically, literally distance
objects. refer measure, dimension, call it, proximity,
okay? Whether not close you, high degree proximity, far away, low
proximity. simply physical space. subjects listened tones. tones
also spaced one another. something simple hand
meeting table top happen sitting front of. [hand hits].
image brain. course, areas brain associated auditory
perception active, not surprisingly, evaluate different types sounds
patterns sounds, instance, [hand hits] can start parse brain areas seem
uniquely tuned spacing sounds, independent sounds coming in.
whether not musical notes, hand hitting table, human speech,
identified brain region uniquely tuned. is, becomes active specifically
response changes spacing sounds, much way
identify brain regions activated changes
distance objects, bowling balls used previous example.
subjects saw different set images. images saw
people, faces. images saw people's faces right
close, images people distance, see whole
body person. Now, also varied emotional relationship people.
is, able get photographs research subjects' lives,
show pictures of, instance, sister random person off
street. show pictures parent, neighbor, celebrity
well known, somebody didn't know all. able vary
position person, close far, able vary emotional
distance person, dimension referring closeness,
not physical closeness, attached, well know somebody. Now,
maybe sounding like somewhat complicated experiment, takeaway
experiment exquisitely simple, exquisitely important. result was,
three conditions, changes physical spacing objects, changes
temporal, is, time spacing sounds, changes emotional
distance subject different people, brain area uniquely


activated. Now incredible thing find, suggests that, yes,
course brain areas associated representation visual objects,
yes, course brain areas associated representation different
sounds. course, brain areas associated faces. now know this.
fact, something called fusiform face area, uniquely tuned faces.
time, unique brain region activated three
conditions described, far somebody,
space, time, terms emotional closeness. brain area, turns out,
brain area called inferior parietal lobule, inferior parietal lobule. Now, don't
need know inferior parietal lobule is.

moment, order understand grief, understand attachments
represented brain. turns attachments breaking
attachments healthy ways governed three important, call dimensions.
dimension just feature world represented brain.
instance, color red doesn't exist brain. happen cells, neurons,
eye respond best long wavelengths light. long wavelengths
light happen reflected off things perceived red.
mind, notion red. know little bit abstract, not actually
lighting red neurons brain, see red. lighting
neurons brain represent presence red things environment.
Similarly, neurons maps, say representations dimensions.
dimensions touch. dimensions sound. now teach you,
three dimensions define relationship people animals things.


people, animals things within immediate vicinity,
know access them, right? somebody's still alive, generally
way access them, unless refusing interact us. Well,
understand that, motivational states can operate way logical. know
that, instance, want find mother, brother, sister, significant other, dog, cat,
parrot, et cetera, go certain set steps.

00:23:15 Three Dimensions Relationships

three dimensions work? going
teach now. risk sounding little bit reductionist, now going
describe relationship anything, everything, anyone, three
dimensions. can that? even want that?
want rob complexity relationships contour detail? Well,
can understand dimensions map relationship people, animals,
things, can understand people, animals, things
not accessible us, hurts much, takes certain amount time
order re-understand, will, remap association them. promise
grasping information give you, will able better orient grief
process, able move effectively. three dimensions
relating someone, animal, thing, space, time, closeness.
order illustrate one work together support relationships
involvement grieving process, going tell experiment.
experiment actually done. experiment involves putting people brain
scanner allows researcher evaluate brain activity different areas. fact,
can look non-biased way, not make predictions brain areas
going involved. experiment following. person, say
research subject, first sees images things reside different distances
one another. say things, objects. one case beach
parking lot bowling balls set different distances one another. brain
imaged, brain imaged, see different pictures different scenes,
beach, parking lot, et cetera, bowling balls spaced different ways, close together,
far apart, regularly spaced, non-regularly spaced. one sort
experiment, see lot brain areas activated. Not surprisingly, visual cortex,


area brain responsible creating visual perceptions, also brain area
seems uniquely tuned distance objects. whether
not bowling balls far away close together one another, whether
not far away close physically, literally distance
objects. refer measure, dimension, call it, proximity,
okay? Whether not close you, high degree proximity, far away, low
proximity. simply physical space. subjects listened tones. tones
also spaced one another. something simple hand
meeting table top happen sitting front of. [hand hits].
image brain. course, areas brain associated auditory
perception active, not surprisingly, evaluate different types sounds
patterns sounds, instance, [hand hits] can start parse brain areas seem
uniquely tuned spacing sounds, independent sounds coming in.
whether not musical notes, hand hitting table, human speech,

subjects saw different set images. images saw
people, faces. images saw people's faces right
close, images people distance, see whole

street. show pictures parent, neighbor, celebrity
well known, somebody didn't know all. able vary
position person, close far, able vary emotional
distance person, dimension referring closeness,
not physical closeness, attached, well know somebody. Now,
maybe sounding like somewhat complicated experiment, takeaway
experiment exquisitely simple, exquisitely important. result was,
three conditions, changes physical spacing objects, changes
temporal, is, time spacing sounds, changes emotional
distance subject different people, brain area uniquely


activated. Now incredible thing find, suggests that, yes,
course brain areas associated representation visual objects,
yes, course brain areas associated representation different
sounds. course, brain areas associated faces. now know this.
fact, something called fusiform face area, uniquely tuned faces.
time, unique brain region activated three
conditions described, far somebody,

brain area called inferior parietal lobule, inferior parietal lobule. Now, don't

maybe sounding like somewhat complicated experiment, takeaway

01:29:42 “Vagal Tone,” Heart Rate, Breathwork & Grief Recovery

people move attachments grieving can somewhat eerie. like take

really wonderful study that, face it, appears a, call negative

paper published journal "Biological Psychology." again, title posed

people just happen more. people need practice long


exhale breathing order build vagal tone, something useful do,
whether grieving not. Now study, people,
say 35 participants, go writing exercise period weeks.
actually wrote three times per week. follow
period time, again, month later. two different groups.
One group so-called written disclosure group. they, day
one, write happened loved one died. indeed

many effective practices moving grief involve, mentioned earlier,
getting close actually deliberately experiencing attachment one
person lost, not distracting one's self, not getting counterfactual
thinking, if, if, if, rather thinking about, case, writing

exhale breathing order build vagal tone, something useful do,
whether grieving not. Now study, people,
say 35 participants, go writing exercise period weeks.

many effective practices moving grief involve, mentioned earlier,
getting close actually deliberately experiencing attachment one

01:29:42 “Vagal Tone,” Heart Rate, Breathwork & Grief Recovery

people move attachments grieving can somewhat eerie. like take

really wonderful study that, face it, appears a, call negative

hypothesis not true. case many interesting scientific findings,
often negative result, interesting result nested

paper published journal "Biological Psychology." again, title posed

people just happen more. people need practice long


exhale breathing order build vagal tone, something useful do,
whether grieving not. Now study, people,
say 35 participants, go writing exercise period weeks.
actually wrote three times per week. follow

One group so-called written disclosure group. they, day

many effective practices moving grief involve, mentioned earlier,
getting close actually deliberately experiencing attachment one
person lost, not distracting one's self, not getting counterfactual

really wonderful study that, face it, appears a, call negative

whether grieving not. Now study, people,
say 35 participants, go writing exercise period weeks.

many effective practices moving grief involve, mentioned earlier,
getting close actually deliberately experiencing attachment one

whether grieving not. Now study, people,
say 35 participants, go writing exercise period weeks.

many effective practices moving grief involve, mentioned earlier,
getting close actually deliberately experiencing attachment one

say 35 participants, go writing exercise period weeks.

means always activating break stress system, just default.
people just happen more. people need practice long


exhale breathing order build vagal tone, something useful do,
whether grieving not. Now study, people,
say 35 participants, go writing exercise period weeks.
actually wrote three times per week. follow

many effective practices moving grief involve, mentioned earlier,
getting close actually deliberately experiencing attachment one

people move attachments grieving can somewhat eerie. like take
moment explore idea allowing really feel attachment
somebody can accelerate least support adaptive transitioning grief.
really wonderful study that, face it, appears a, call negative
result. negative result hypothesis posed, turns


hypothesis not true. case many interesting scientific findings,
often negative result, interesting result nested
negative outcome. case particular paper share now.
paper published journal "Biological Psychology." again, title posed
question, is, "Emotional Disclosure Whom? Study Vagal Tone
Bereavement." study explored whether not written disclosure
emotional connection somebody lost effective way people
move grieving process. study also explored so-called vagus

calming effects brain body, although certainly not always case.
way think terms going talk now heart rate
heart rate variability. simplistic terms, heart just allowed beat
sort default rate, rate rather high, activation so-
called sympathetic arm autonomic nervous system, alertness component
autonomic nervous system. parasympathetic nervous system, called,
involves calming. sometimes hear sympathetic stress fight flight.
lot things well, mention, not sympathy. Sympa simply
means together, reflects activity bunch neurons active

unquote rest digest functions, calming functions, although certainly involved
things well. sympathetic nervous system drives alertness, panic, stress, et
cetera. Parasympathetic nervous system, meaning distinct set neurons drive

like seesaw alertness calm, alertness calm, sympathetic
parasympathetic, back forth. vagus nerve generally associated
parasympathetic functions, capacity slow heart rate,
particular, exhales, just simply movement diaphragm

paraphrase paper, see takes us terms navigating

ongoing, "vagal influence heart." high degree vagal tone,
means always activating break stress system, just default.
people just happen more. people need practice long


exhale breathing order build vagal tone, something useful do,
whether grieving not. Now study, people,
say 35 participants, go writing exercise period weeks.

One group so-called written disclosure group. they, day

many effective practices moving grief involve, mentioned earlier,
getting close actually deliberately experiencing attachment one

whether grieving not. Now study, people,
say 35 participants, go writing exercise period weeks.
actually wrote three times per week. follow
period time, again, month later. two different groups.
One group so-called written disclosure group. they, day
one, write happened loved one died. indeed
used people experienced real loss. asked talk
write deepest emotions thoughts it, memories loved one,
intense stuff, think it, immediate period lost
someone. actually asked write letter person lost.
again, intense exercise go through, indeed lose somebody
subjects had. course testing, period time later,
tell period, testing involved. group so-called
control group, simply told write use time.
emotionally kind empty writing exercise, will. described
today woke up, et cetera, no heavy emotional content, on. Now,
mentioned earlier, immediate results study negative result, meaning no
effect. disclosure that, say, emotionally intense writing group
control group not differ baseline symptom measures psychological
variables, tell us, least face value, somewhat disappointingly, really
wasn't kind difference outcome group wrote
emotionally intense stuff versus non-emotionally intense. Now, didn't tell thus
far exercise all. exercise
many effective practices moving grief involve, mentioned earlier,
getting close actually deliberately experiencing attachment one
person lost, not distracting one's self, not getting counterfactual
thinking, if, if, if, rather thinking about, case, writing
real attachment. initial idea was, people write
attachment, going experience attachment, will serve
many ways, terms moving grief. wasn't found.
found no difference two groups, explored higher
vagal tone, greater degree so-called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.
words, able modulate state, using breathing body.


discovered subset individuals high degree vagal

consider fairly preliminary 35 subjects. Although, know,
study unto think quite nice one, really set stage number
studies followed, group groups, really point fact
yes, indeed, accessing states emotionality writing thinking
somebody quite powerful terms engaging bodily states mind states

beneficial sensing attachment. now makes perfect sense
people benefit sort practice others,
people able access real somatic feelings attachment writing
attachment, thinking it, others. brings us back earlier
discussion having, talking people seem
move things quickly, don't seem grieving constantly, spouse
family member person might think, "Gosh, aren't upset?
can functional not," or, "how can functional?"
can even fractures families relationships basis differences rates
grieving on. Well, this, again, probably relates psychology
different attachments people person animal thing lost,
no doubt also much mind/body connection, much vagal tone
exists person, suddenly found grief episode.
actually offers multiple opportunities. somebody, instance, grieving
intensely often finding immensely difficult move grief
reasonable rate, might even say, find diagnosed prolonged grief
disorder complicated grief syndrome way really impairing adaptive

three minutes one five minutes, every per day,


immensely beneficial building mind/body relationship. again,

people experiencing complicated grieving versus non-complicated grieving,
find 4:00 p.m. 9:00 p.m. cortisol levels significantly higher


non-complicated grieving group. raises interesting idea, relates
closely talking vagal tone. imagine situation

01:54:28 Tools: Grief Processing & Adaptive Recovery

positioning able best possible way requires proper

realize word disorder implies sorts things, again, just naming
