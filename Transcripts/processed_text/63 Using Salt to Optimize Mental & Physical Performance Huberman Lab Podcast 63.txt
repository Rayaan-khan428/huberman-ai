always, thank interest science. dive topic
today's episode, want highlight really exciting new study. study
Diego Bohorquez' lab Duke University. Bohorquez Lab studies interactions
gut brain made incredible discoveries so-
called neuropod cells. Neuropod cells neurons, nerve cells, reside gut
detect things like fatty acids, amino acids, neuropod cells sense sugar.
Previous work laboratory shown ingest sugar,
neuropod cells respond sugar send electrical signals little wire
call axon vagus nerve, want know,
brain, subsequent stations neural processing, evoke release
dopamine. Dopamine molecule known promote craving motivation
indeed action, neuropod cells send sugar thought
promote seeking consumption, eating sugary foods. Now, incredible
thing subconscious. taste system gut not available
conscious awareness. Now, course, ingest sweet foods, taste
mouth too, part reason crave sweet foods, perhaps,
taste good you, reason neuropod cells
driving chemical craving conscious detection, really two systems.
gut sensing, subconscious level, sending signals
brain work concert, parallel signals coming mouth
experience taste food. Now, alone incredible,
subject many important landmark papers last decade so. can imagine
system important things like hidden sugars nowadays,
lot processed foods, putting hidden sugars. putting lot things
cause gut send signals brain make crave
foods, really love sugar, just understand not just
sugar tastes. new study Bohorquez Lab deserves attention, believe.
paper published just recently, February 25th year, 2022, "Nature
Neuroscience," excellent journal, title paper "The Preference
Sugar Sweetener "Depends Gut Sensor Cell." Bohorquez Lab now
discovered neuropod cell, meaning category neurons, can distinguish
sweet things gut contain calories, instance, sugar, things
gut sweet not contain calories: artificial sweeteners like aspartame,
sucralose, forth. also, course, nonartificial, noncaloric sweeteners


like stevia, monk fruit, et cetera. not explore full gallery artificial
sweeteners. find, however, pertain forms sweet,
noncaloric substances. discovered signature pattern
signals sent gut brain ingest artificial noncaloric sweeteners.
important says subconscious level, gut can
distinguish sweet things contain calories sweet things not.
Now, downstream consequences sensing isn't yet
clear. Now, believe everyone aware kinds studies couple
reasons. First all, important understand crave, meaning foods
crave drinks crave, is, part, due conscious experience
taste things, also due biochemical neural events start body
impinge brain cause seek certain things even though
might not know seeking sugar. find craving lot
sugar, craving lot foods artificial sweeteners, don't
necessarily know why. Now, artificial sweeteners somewhat
controversial topic. want highlight that. months back, described study
Yale University one can condition insulin system. Insulin involved
mobilizing blood sugar forth body, many know, described
studies done Yale University School Medicine looking
artificial sweeteners can actually evoke insulin response certain conditions.
Now, couple key things. got little bit pushback covering studies,
encourage pushback time. Pushback one things forces
us drill deeper topic. want clear. First all, not one demonize
artificial sweeteners. evidence, animal models, animal models, artificial
sweeteners can disrupt gut microbiome, fairly high doses artificial
sweeteners, unclear thing pertains humans, still unclear,
say, not investigated thoroughly. people don't like taste artificial
sweeteners. people do. people find really help avoid
excessive caloric intake. people believe, yet emphasize still
isn't evidence can adjust insulin response people. just want repeat
three times people clear fact. new data emphasize,
however, need understand artificial sweeteners consumed
level gut, say registered level gut changes
brain function one thing familiar many people report


first taste artificial sweeteners, taste sort not right them. don't
like taste, time, actually start crave taste. experienced this.
used drink lot diet sodas graduate school,
aspartame, found would, actually needed them. Now, maybe
caffeine. Maybe just liked sweet taste carbonation. actually drive
carbonation, topic future episode, finally quit them,
reasons independent fear artificial sweeteners, found didn't
like taste. Nowadays, occasionally drink diet soda. usually
plane nothing else available me, don't demonize them. might drink
one every while. No big deal. also want clear consume stevia
number different supplements foods consume. Stevia, course, plant-
based noncaloric sweetener, I, myself, consume artificial sweeteners. Many people
hate them. Many people like find useful nutrition, fact,
keep caloric intake range right them, many people, like myself,
curious somewhat wary yet continue consume
small amounts. think people probably fall category. also
mention many food manufacturers put artificial sweeteners, sucralose, et
cetera, foods, always unclear might want that,
yet know sweet taste consumption, even doesn't contain calories, can
drive craving sweet food, may logic strategy
that. Again, topic exploration today's podcast future podcasts

20% off. Okay, talk salt. Salt many, many important functions brain
body. instance, regulates fluid balance, much fluid desire
much fluid excrete. also regulates desire salt itself, meaning salt
appetite. homeostatically driven salt appetite. talk mechanisms
today, make clear. means crave salty things,
beverages foods, salt stores low, tend avoid salty
beverages foods salt stores high, although not always
case. circumstances continue crave salt even though don't
need salt indeed even need eliminate salt system. Salt also
regulates appetite nutrients, things like sugar, things like carbohydrates,
today, explore that. Technically, salt mineral, mention


say salt, indeed referring sodium, cases, although will
clear distinguish salt sodium, meaning table salt sodium. people don't
realize this, one gram table salt contains 388 milligrams sodium,
technically, talking sodium today not salt. will use
interchangeably unless referring specific recommendations ideas
trying define ideal salt, aka sodium intake, okay? important. think,
right off bat, lot people get place confusion potentially
even place trouble thinking table salt grams always equates sodium

00:24:15 Salt & Thirst

effectively dead dead soon, important brain region, talk
function OVLT flesh aspects circuitry,
communication brain areas body context something


familiar with, thirst. ever wondered just get
thirsty? Well, neurons OVLT detecting changes
bloodstream, detect global changes within body, response that,
OVLT sets off certain events within brain body make either want
drink fluid stop drinking fluid. two main kinds thirst. first
one called osmotic thirst, second called hypovolemic thirst. Osmotic thirst
concentration salt bloodstream, say ingest
something very, salty. say ingest big bag of, confess don't eat
often, really like kettle potato chips, pretty salty. never
actually measured much sodium them. sure information there. Every
while, particularly interested so, just bag things,
really like them, salty, almost always make feel
thirsty, reason eating those, ingested lot sodium. Again, not
frequent occurrence me, happens every now again, don't
much shame think pretty healthy relationship food
enjoy them, understand will drive salt levels bloodstream,
will cause thirsty, why? Why? neurons OVLT come two
main varieties. One variety senses osmolarity blood getting across
weak little fence talked before, osmolarity, meaning salt
concentration blood, high, activates specific neurons OVLT,
activates, mean causes send electrical potentials, literally, send electrical
signals brain areas, brain areas inspire number different
downstream events, brain areas? Well, OVLT signals
area called supraoptic nucleus. name called supraoptic nucleus
not necessarily important. also signals so-called paraventricular nucleus,
another nucleus sits near ventricles can monitor qualities, chemical
qualities cerebrospinal fluid well as, probably, bloodstream well,
consequence communication particular hormone eventually released
posterior pituitary. Now, pituitary gland sits near roof
mouth. releases sorts things like growth hormone luteinizing hormone.
Luteinizing hormone will stimulate things like estrogen testosterone production
release ovaries testes on. pituitary bunch different
compartments functions, really cool pituitary certain
regions pituitary actually contain axons, wires neurons, neurons


reside brain, supraoptic nucleus gets signal OVLT.
signal purely form electrical activity. Remember, neurons aren't talking one
another happening there. not saying, "Psst! "Hey,
much salt bloodstream. "Let's something it." receive so-
called action potential, waves electricity. neurons supraoptic nucleus
release electrical signals within pituitary, neurons
nearby neurons capable releasing hormones well electrical signals,
pituitary, hormonal signal released called vasopressin. Vasopressin
also goes name antidiuretic hormone, antidiuretic hormone capacity
either restrict amount urine secrete, or, system turned off,
increase amount urine secrete, complicated set
cascades evoked high salt concentration blood. also
complicated set cascades evoked low concentrations sodium
blood, pathway nonetheless same. OVLT detecting
osmolarity changes, communicating supraoptic nucleus. Supraoptic nucleus
either causing release releasing vasopressin, antidiuretic hormone,
system shut off antidiuretic hormone not secreted, allow
urine flow freely, right? Antidiuretic means anti release urine, shutting
off, going cause release urine. sort allowing system
flow, speak. second category thirst hypovolemic thirst.

00:29:27 Blood Pressure & Thirst

Hypovolemic thirst occurs drop blood pressure, okay? OVLT,
mentioned before, can sense osmolarity based fact neurons
can detect much salt bloodstream, OVLT also harbors neurons
baroreceptor, mechanoreceptor category. Now, baroreceptors
mechanoreceptors later, baroreceptors essentially receptor, meaning
protein cell responds changes blood pressure, number
things can cause decreases blood pressure. include,
instance, lose lot blood, right? bleeding quite lot, cases,
vomit quite lot, extensive diarrhea combination those,
things can reduce blood volume, will talk
later, classic case hypovolemic thirst, one simply losing blood,


therefore, blood pressure goes down, simple imagine mind.
pipes, arteries, veins, capillaries, lose
blood volume, pressure arteries, veins, capillaries goes down. OVLT
neurons can sense reduction blood pressure presence
baroreceptors OVLT. elements also play response
call hypovolemic thirst. instance, kidney will secrete something called
renin. Renin will activate something called angiotensin II lungs, things,
amazing, angiotensin II can act OVLT, organum vasculosum lateral
terminalis, which, turn, will create thirst, okay? cases, right? osmolarity
sensing system, meaning osmotic thirst, hypovolemic thirst, blood pressure
dropped, end result desire drink more, desire drink
comes variety pathways direct indirect, include
vasopressin don't include vasopressin, think, just sake general example,
even don't biology background physiology
background, just understand two main types thirst. types thirst,
osmotic thirst hypovolemic thirst, not just seeking water, also
seeking salt. general terms, salt, aka sodium, can help retain water. Now,
doesn't mean salt always retains water. excessive amounts salt,
will retain excessive amounts water? Well, sort of. soon learn,
contextual, cases, can say salt system, brain
body can function normally provided levels salt adequate not
high low, thirst, often think just way bring fluid
body, designed kind interoceptive perception. mean that,
interoception, many know now listening podcast, paying
attention recognition, rather, conscious recognition events going within
body, thirsty, certain form interoception. go, "Oh, need
something crave something." may not know exactly need,
thirsty, not just seeking water; also seeking balance
osmolarity, means may seeking salty fluids foods, cases.
try accomplish eating, may trying avoid, will
inspired avoid salty fluids foods, want understand sodium
roles body, understand thirst, want understand thirst,
understand fluid balance regulated body. not surprising
all, sodium water work together order generate call thirst.



00:33:47 Kidneys & Urine Regulation

Sodium water work together order either retain water inspire us let go water,
urinate, can dive specifics around salt use salt
performance various recommendations things avoid, need drill little
bit deeper fluid balance mechanism body, reason,
pay least little bit attention kidney. kidney incredible organ,
one reasons kidney amazing responsible retaining,
holding onto, allowing release various substances body, substances
like glucose amino acids, urea, uric acid, salt, potassium, magnesium. basically
filter, very, intelligent filter. mean, intelligent meaning doesn't
mind, way works really beautiful. Basically, blood enters kidney
goes series tubes arranged loops. want look
this, beautiful Loop Henle aspects kidney design
allow certain substances retained substances released, depending
concentrated substances blood. kidney responds
number hormonal signals, including vasopressin, order to, instance, antidiuretic
hormone, order hold onto fluid brain body need,
responds hormonal signals well, pretty complex organ. Nonetheless,
key point, already mentioned, think people don't realize.
actually something like tell kids meet them, provided
appropriate age. say, oftentimes, kids learn scientist, ask
question something related science, hopefully, sake, something
neuroscience, one thing tell kids, say, "Do know urine,
pee, "is actually filtered blood?" occasionally, will really terrify kid,
also occasionally really terrifies adult, indeed, urine filtered blood.
Basically, blood gets kidney. kidney's going filter certain things.
Certain things going allowed pass others not, okay?
way kidney designed 90% stuff absorbed blood
going absorbed early series tubes, small percentage
going regulated worked get called distal kidney.
mean, distal just means furthest part away, okay? proximal close, like
shoulder proximal midline body, hand distal,


biological terms, hear proximal, distal, just means near far from,
just give really simple example, say low fluid. haven't
much drink while. Maybe walking around hot day. Chances
neurons OVLT will sense increase osmolarity, right?
concentration salt going increased relative fluid volume
circulating. This, course, assumes haven't excreted lot sodium one
reason another, increase osmolarity detected OVLT. OVLT
going signal bunch different cascades supraoptic nucleus, et cetera,
then, vasopressin going released bloodstream, vasopressin,
again, also called antidiuretic hormone, going act kidney change
kidney's function couple different ways, mechanical, chemical, okay?
order make sure kidney not release much water, doesn't make
want urinate, fact, even try urinate, body's going tend
hold onto fluid stores. simple, straightforward example. can also give
example whereby ingesting lot, lot, lot water, not
particularly hot day, not sweating much, assume salt intake
constant low whatever reason, well, then, osmolarity, salt concentration
blood, going lower. OVLT will detect
osmosensing neurons OVLT. OVLT will fail signal supraoptic
nucleus, will not release vasopressin antidiuretic hormone,
can excrete water body wants excrete, meaning able
urinate. no holding onto water level kidney, okay? simple
examples, hopefully, illustrates events within blood, meaning
concentration salt relative amount fluid, right? osmolarity is,
detected OVLT. brain communicates pituitary. pituitary sends
hormone blood, hormone acts kidney either hold onto
let go fluid, meaning prevent wanting urinate stimulating
want urinate. Very, simple kind yes/no-type situation here. lot
nuance reality. lot hormones pathway, think,
least stage discussion,

before, blood flows kidney. number things retained early part

antidiuretic hormone prevents bladder filling all.
not locks fluid bladder prevents urinating. think way
describing things now way hear antidiuretic hormone,
might sound like kind locks bladder prevents able
urinate, full bladder. uncomfortable. not


way works. actually causes tubes headed towards bladder kidney
become permeable, meaning allow fluid go back bloodstream, rest
body, fluid never actually fills bladder, never feel urge
urinate. Now, episode salt. key thing understand kidney
kidney uses sodium order conserve water, everything
fact sodium can actually hold water. Put differently, water tends follow
sodium, sodium, tend water, sodium,
concentrated, can hold onto water, one main ways kidney holds
onto water body, soon learn, no simple direct formula
say, instance, "Okay, salt levels high, lot water retained, "and salt
levels low, lot water released." one hand, can true, also
case systems homeostatic, meaning always seeking
balance, within system, within salt system, systems, salt
water system. also case, often, enough sodium, well, can
secrete sodium water will follow, don't enough sodium, then,
yes, indeed not holding onto water, fluid can excreted,
condition low sodium lasts long enough, start retain water
body recognizes, "Ah, salt low, water excreted," eventually, system
will kick retain water, love give simple black-and-white, yes-or-no
answer low sodium, high sodium, moderate sodium, water balance,
contextual, say contextual, mean, will depend blood pressure,
hypertension, prehypertension, there, maybe normal tension, hormone levels,
exercise, et cetera, et cetera. pretty good example complicated can
one may familiar with. pretty well known certain
phases menstrual cycle, estrogen progesterone hormones
fluctuating, water can retained body. called edema,
swelling, sometimes, common assumption, indeed, can true,
estrogen levels high, water retention body. Also, males, estrogen
levels high, can water retention body. one reasons
athletes and, particular, bodybuilders take anabolic steroids like testosterone,
can converted estrogens, sometimes look, walk around,
look like partially inflated. look like going pop, looks like
swelling skin, not just large muscles, not always,
often, water retention due testosterone conversion estrogen. Now,


sounds consistent, right? Estrogen levels fluctuate menstrual cycle. males,
increase estrogen, retention water, actually, estrogen
acts diuretic, one think, "Okay, estrogen levels go up, "there
lot fluid excreted," bring example point
complicated dynamic balance hormones salt fluid. can't draw
one-to-one relationship there, turns important point,
can use that, not way complicate things, way understand
contexts

00:45:46 Much Salt Need?

body. instance, regulates fluid balance, much fluid desire
much fluid excrete. also regulates desire salt itself, meaning salt
appetite. homeostatically driven salt appetite. talk mechanisms
today, make clear. means crave salty things,
beverages foods, salt stores low, tend avoid salty
beverages foods salt stores high, although not always
case. circumstances continue crave salt even though don't
need salt indeed even need eliminate salt system. Salt also
regulates appetite nutrients, things like sugar, things like carbohydrates,
today, explore that. Technically, salt mineral, mention


say salt, indeed referring sodium, cases, although will
clear distinguish salt sodium, meaning table salt sodium. people don't
realize this, one gram table salt contains 388 milligrams sodium,
technically, talking sodium today not salt. will use
interchangeably unless referring specific recommendations ideas
trying define ideal salt, aka sodium intake, okay? important. think,
right off bat, lot people get place confusion potentially
even place trouble thinking table salt grams always equates sodium
grams, simply not case. Today, going explore neural

interact context salt-seeking, salt avoidance, determine need
salt, need less salt.

00:17:13 Brain Senses Salt

talk kidney function. get it, going
systematically, start brain. harbor small sets neurons. call
sets neurons nuclei, meaning little clusters neurons, sense levels
salt brain body. couple brain regions this, brain
regions very, special, special lack biological fences around
brain areas have, fences, say fence, goes
particular name, name blood-brain barrier, BBB. substances
circulating around body not access brain, particular, large
molecules can't just pass brain. brain privileged organ sense.
couple organs privileged strict barriers,
particular fences, will, organs include things like ovaries
testes, makes sense following reason: First all, brain, least
brain, cannot regenerate injury. just simply can't replace brain cells
injury. know people get really excited neurogenesis, birth new neurons,
indeed, neurogenesis demonstrated animal models, extent

blood-brain barrier around brain, absolutely critical. ovaries testes
barrier for, assume, reason contain genetic material

children will genes, least half them, half partner,
course. cells within ovaries testes mutated, well, then, can get
mutations offspring, costly evolutionary sense, makes sense
barrier blood ingest called mutagen,
ingest something can mutate genes cells, can imagine
premium not allowing mutagens get brain, ovaries,
testes, okay? brain BBB, blood-brain barrier around it,
makes very, hard substances pass brain unless substances
small substances molecules critically required brain

little sets neurons sit just side weak fences,
important famous these, sake today's conversation, one called OVLT.


OVLT stands organum vasculosum lateral terminalis. called
circumventricular organ. circumventricular? Well, not bog

bloodstream access it, structure referring to, OVLT,
organum vasculosum lateral terminalis, neurons can sense contents
blood and, extent, cerebrospinal fluid. couple brain
areas can well. go also name circumventricular organs,
talk names areas, today, think
sake discussion, understand OVLT special. Why?
doesn't thick barrier fence, sounds like bad thing, yet terrific
border detector. neurons region able pay attention passing
bloodstream can detect, instance, levels sodium
bloodstream low, level blood pressure body low high,
then, OVLT can send signals brain areas, then, brain
areas can things like release hormones can go act tissues call
periphery, body, and, instance, kidneys secrete urine get
rid salt excessive salt body kidneys hold onto urine, hold
onto whatever water fluid one might need, go deeper
pathway, just understand OVLT limited barrier. can detect things
bloodstream, incredible area brain, almost single-handedly, sets off
cascades things allow regulate salt balance, turns
absolutely critical, not just ability think neurons work,
indeed, life. OVLT doesn't function correctly,

00:24:15 Salt & Thirst

effectively dead dead soon, important brain region, talk
function OVLT flesh aspects circuitry,
communication brain areas body context something


familiar with, thirst. ever wondered just get
thirsty? Well, neurons OVLT detecting changes
bloodstream, detect global changes within body, response that,
OVLT sets off certain events within brain body make either want
drink fluid stop drinking fluid. two main kinds thirst. first
one called osmotic thirst, second called hypovolemic thirst. Osmotic thirst
concentration salt bloodstream, say ingest
something very, salty. say ingest big bag of, confess don't eat
often, really like kettle potato chips, pretty salty. never
actually measured much sodium them. sure information there. Every
while, particularly interested so, just bag things,
really like them, salty, almost always make feel
thirsty, reason eating those, ingested lot sodium. Again, not
frequent occurrence me, happens every now again, don't
much shame think pretty healthy relationship food
enjoy them, understand will drive salt levels bloodstream,
will cause thirsty, why? Why? neurons OVLT come two
main varieties. One variety senses osmolarity blood getting across
weak little fence talked before, osmolarity, meaning salt
concentration blood, high, activates specific neurons OVLT,
activates, mean causes send electrical potentials, literally, send electrical
signals brain areas, brain areas inspire number different
downstream events, brain areas? Well, OVLT signals
area called supraoptic nucleus. name called supraoptic nucleus
not necessarily important. also signals so-called paraventricular nucleus,
another nucleus sits near ventricles can monitor qualities, chemical
qualities cerebrospinal fluid well as, probably, bloodstream well,
consequence communication particular hormone eventually released
posterior pituitary. Now, pituitary gland sits near roof
mouth. releases sorts things like growth hormone luteinizing hormone.
Luteinizing hormone will stimulate things like estrogen testosterone production
release ovaries testes on. pituitary bunch different
compartments functions, really cool pituitary certain
regions pituitary actually contain axons, wires neurons, neurons


reside brain, supraoptic nucleus gets signal OVLT.
signal purely form electrical activity. Remember, neurons aren't talking one
another happening there. not saying, "Psst! "Hey,
much salt bloodstream. "Let's something it." receive so-
called action potential, waves electricity. neurons supraoptic nucleus
release electrical signals within pituitary, neurons
nearby neurons capable releasing hormones well electrical signals,
pituitary, hormonal signal released called vasopressin. Vasopressin
also goes name antidiuretic hormone, antidiuretic hormone capacity
either restrict amount urine secrete, or, system turned off,
increase amount urine secrete, complicated set
cascades evoked high salt concentration blood. also
complicated set cascades evoked low concentrations sodium
blood, pathway nonetheless same. OVLT detecting
osmolarity changes, communicating supraoptic nucleus. Supraoptic nucleus
either causing release releasing vasopressin, antidiuretic hormone,
system shut off antidiuretic hormone not secreted, allow
urine flow freely, right? Antidiuretic means anti release urine, shutting
off, going cause release urine. sort allowing system
flow, speak. second category thirst hypovolemic thirst.

00:29:27 Blood Pressure & Thirst

Hypovolemic thirst occurs drop blood pressure, okay? OVLT,
mentioned before, can sense osmolarity based fact neurons
can detect much salt bloodstream, OVLT also harbors neurons
baroreceptor, mechanoreceptor category. Now, baroreceptors
mechanoreceptors later, baroreceptors essentially receptor, meaning
protein cell responds changes blood pressure, number
things can cause decreases blood pressure. include,
instance, lose lot blood, right? bleeding quite lot, cases,
vomit quite lot, extensive diarrhea combination those,
things can reduce blood volume, will talk
later, classic case hypovolemic thirst, one simply losing blood,


therefore, blood pressure goes down, simple imagine mind.
pipes, arteries, veins, capillaries, lose
blood volume, pressure arteries, veins, capillaries goes down. OVLT
neurons can sense reduction blood pressure presence
baroreceptors OVLT. elements also play response
call hypovolemic thirst. instance, kidney will secrete something called
renin. Renin will activate something called angiotensin II lungs, things,
amazing, angiotensin II can act OVLT, organum vasculosum lateral
terminalis, which, turn, will create thirst, okay? cases, right? osmolarity
sensing system, meaning osmotic thirst, hypovolemic thirst, blood pressure
dropped, end result desire drink more, desire drink
comes variety pathways direct indirect, include
vasopressin don't include vasopressin, think, just sake general example,
even don't biology background physiology
background, just understand two main types thirst. types thirst,
osmotic thirst hypovolemic thirst, not just seeking water, also
seeking salt. general terms, salt, aka sodium, can help retain water. Now,
doesn't mean salt always retains water. excessive amounts salt,
will retain excessive amounts water? Well, sort of. soon learn,
contextual, cases, can say salt system, brain
body can function normally provided levels salt adequate not
high low, thirst, often think just way bring fluid
body, designed kind interoceptive perception. mean that,
interoception, many know now listening podcast, paying
attention recognition, rather, conscious recognition events going within
body, thirsty, certain form interoception. go, "Oh, need
something crave something." may not know exactly need,
thirsty, not just seeking water; also seeking balance
osmolarity, means may seeking salty fluids foods, cases.
try accomplish eating, may trying avoid, will
inspired avoid salty fluids foods, want understand sodium
roles body, understand thirst, want understand thirst,
understand fluid balance regulated body. not surprising
all, sodium water work together order generate call thirst.



00:33:47 Kidneys & Urine Regulation

Sodium water work together order either retain water inspire us let go water,
urinate, can dive specifics around salt use salt
performance various recommendations things avoid, need drill little
bit deeper fluid balance mechanism body, reason,
pay least little bit attention kidney. kidney incredible organ,
one reasons kidney amazing responsible retaining,
holding onto, allowing release various substances body, substances
like glucose amino acids, urea, uric acid, salt, potassium, magnesium. basically
filter, very, intelligent filter. mean, intelligent meaning doesn't
mind, way works really beautiful. Basically, blood enters kidney
goes series tubes arranged loops. want look
this, beautiful Loop Henle aspects kidney design
allow certain substances retained substances released, depending
concentrated substances blood. kidney responds
number hormonal signals, including vasopressin, order to, instance, antidiuretic
hormone, order hold onto fluid brain body need,
responds hormonal signals well, pretty complex organ. Nonetheless,
key point, already mentioned, think people don't realize.
actually something like tell kids meet them, provided
appropriate age. say, oftentimes, kids learn scientist, ask
question something related science, hopefully, sake, something
neuroscience, one thing tell kids, say, "Do know urine,
pee, "is actually filtered blood?" occasionally, will really terrify kid,
also occasionally really terrifies adult, indeed, urine filtered blood.
Basically, blood gets kidney. kidney's going filter certain things.
Certain things going allowed pass others not, okay?
way kidney designed 90% stuff absorbed blood
going absorbed early series tubes, small percentage
going regulated worked get called distal kidney.
mean, distal just means furthest part away, okay? proximal close, like
shoulder proximal midline body, hand distal,


biological terms, hear proximal, distal, just means near far from,
just give really simple example, say low fluid. haven't
much drink while. Maybe walking around hot day. Chances
neurons OVLT will sense increase osmolarity, right?
concentration salt going increased relative fluid volume
circulating. This, course, assumes haven't excreted lot sodium one
reason another, increase osmolarity detected OVLT. OVLT
going signal bunch different cascades supraoptic nucleus, et cetera,
then, vasopressin going released bloodstream, vasopressin,
again, also called antidiuretic hormone, going act kidney change
kidney's function couple different ways, mechanical, chemical, okay?
order make sure kidney not release much water, doesn't make
want urinate, fact, even try urinate, body's going tend
hold onto fluid stores. simple, straightforward example. can also give
example whereby ingesting lot, lot, lot water, not
particularly hot day, not sweating much, assume salt intake
constant low whatever reason, well, then, osmolarity, salt concentration
blood, going lower. OVLT will detect
osmosensing neurons OVLT. OVLT will fail signal supraoptic
nucleus, will not release vasopressin antidiuretic hormone,
can excrete water body wants excrete, meaning able
urinate. no holding onto water level kidney, okay? simple
examples, hopefully, illustrates events within blood, meaning
concentration salt relative amount fluid, right? osmolarity is,
detected OVLT. brain communicates pituitary. pituitary sends
hormone blood, hormone acts kidney either hold onto
let go fluid, meaning prevent wanting urinate stimulating
want urinate. Very, simple kind yes/no-type situation here. lot
nuance reality. lot hormones pathway, think,
least stage discussion,

00:39:08 Vasopressin: Roles Libido & Urination

sufficient. may noticed molecule


talking lot today, vasopressin, also mentioned previous episode
Huberman Lab Podcast, different context. molecule referring
vasopressin, and, mentioned, hormone involved antidiuresis, meaning
preventing urination. antidiuretic, also talked vasopressin
context desire, love, attachment. talked context monogamy
nonmonogamy species animal called prairie vole. can check
episode. believe vasopressin nonmonogamous prairie voles mentioned
timestamp, easy find. Vasopressin made multiple locations
nervous system, mainly supraoptic nucleus, indeed, also involved aspects
sexual behavior mating. Now, mechanisms distinct
antidiuretic effects. fact, people take vasopressin
aphrodisiac. Now, certainly not suggesting people that,
confidence world moment talk vasopressin, someone
comments going say, "What think vasopressin nasal sprays "and
kind thing?" Vasopressin, indeed oxytocin, another hormone involved
pair bonding various aspects brain body function, available nasal
sprays can get deep recesses brain can impact
core call hypothalamic functions, primitive drives hypothalamic
functions. encourage lot caution, maybe even extreme caution
recreational use things like vasopressin oxytocin unless working MD,
MD, excuse me, prescribe really know doing.
powerful hormones lot different effects brain body.
way vasopressin, meaning antidiuretic hormone, prevents release fluid
urine body pretty interesting. acts directly kidney, so, mentioned
before, blood flows kidney. number things retained early part
kidney. Vasopressin acts fairly distal, meaning kind end game part
loops tubes kidney, increases permeability tubes.
words, makes sure fluid otherwise pass collecting duct
go bladder never actually makes bladder. point
antidiuretic hormone prevents bladder filling all.
not locks fluid bladder prevents urinating. think way
describing things now way hear antidiuretic hormone,
might sound like kind locks bladder prevents able
urinate, full bladder. uncomfortable. not


way works. actually causes tubes headed towards bladder kidney
become permeable, meaning allow fluid go back bloodstream, rest
body, fluid never actually fills bladder, never feel urge
urinate. Now, episode salt. key thing understand kidney
kidney uses sodium order conserve water, everything
fact sodium can actually hold water. Put differently, water tends follow
sodium, sodium, tend water, sodium,
concentrated, can hold onto water, one main ways kidney holds
onto water body, soon learn, no simple direct formula
say, instance, "Okay, salt levels high, lot water retained, "and salt
levels low, lot water released." one hand, can true, also
case systems homeostatic, meaning always seeking
balance, within system, within salt system, systems, salt
water system. also case, often, enough sodium, well, can
secrete sodium water will follow, don't enough sodium, then,
yes, indeed not holding onto water, fluid can excreted,
condition low sodium lasts long enough, start retain water
body recognizes, "Ah, salt low, water excreted," eventually, system
will kick retain water, love give simple black-and-white, yes-or-no
answer low sodium, high sodium, moderate sodium, water balance,
contextual, say contextual, mean, will depend blood pressure,
hypertension, prehypertension, there, maybe normal tension, hormone levels,
exercise, et cetera, et cetera. pretty good example complicated can
one may familiar with. pretty well known certain
phases menstrual cycle, estrogen progesterone hormones
fluctuating, water can retained body. called edema,
swelling, sometimes, common assumption, indeed, can true,
estrogen levels high, water retention body. Also, males, estrogen
levels high, can water retention body. one reasons
athletes and, particular, bodybuilders take anabolic steroids like testosterone,
can converted estrogens, sometimes look, walk around,
look like partially inflated. look like going pop, looks like
swelling skin, not just large muscles, not always,
often, water retention due testosterone conversion estrogen. Now,


sounds consistent, right? Estrogen levels fluctuate menstrual cycle. males,
increase estrogen, retention water, actually, estrogen
acts diuretic, one think, "Okay, estrogen levels go up, "there
lot fluid excreted," bring example point
complicated dynamic balance hormones salt fluid. can't draw
one-to-one relationship there, turns important point,
can use that, not way complicate things, way understand
contexts

00:45:46 Much Salt Need?

turn attention now, much salt need? can trust terms
trying guide ingestion salt? First all, want very, clear
number people prehypertension hypertension. need

01:47:13 Role Sodium Neuronal Function, Action Potentials

salty sweet interact. Now, thus far, already covered quite lot material,
completely remiss didn't emphasize crucial role sodium plays
way neurons function. fact, sodium one key elements allows
neurons function all, way engaging call action

can engage electrical activity number different ways. graded
potentials. gap junctions. whole landscape different
electrophysiologies neurons don't want go just yet, least not

neuroscientists use. just going briefly describe action potential role
sodium plays, will involve little bit chemistry, promise will

suppress action potentials neurons. way whole process occurs
given neuron needs change electrical activity, normally, neurons
hanging out, call negative charge, reason
negative charge inside cell things floating around like
potassium, little bit sodium, stuff like chloride. literally just, just
imagine little balls stuff, negative charge them,
inside cell going tend negative, outside cell, turns out,
going bunch stuff positively charged, one main
factors creating positive charge sodium. Sodium carries positive charge,
neurons can just imagine a, sake discussion, can just
imagine sphere little wire sticking it. can put little minus

today, make clear. means crave salty things,
beverages foods, salt stores low, tend avoid salty
beverages foods salt stores high, although not always
case. circumstances continue crave salt even though don't
need salt indeed even need eliminate salt system. Salt also
regulates appetite nutrients, things like sugar, things like carbohydrates,
today, explore that. Technically, salt mineral, mention


say salt, indeed referring sodium, cases, although will
clear distinguish salt sodium, meaning table salt sodium. people don't
realize this, one gram table salt contains 388 milligrams sodium,
technically, talking sodium today not salt. will use
interchangeably unless referring specific recommendations ideas
trying define ideal salt, aka sodium intake, okay? important. think,
right off bat, lot people get place confusion potentially
even place trouble thinking table salt grams always equates sodium

00:24:15 Salt & Thirst

effectively dead dead soon, important brain region, talk

familiar with, thirst. ever wondered just get
thirsty? Well, neurons OVLT detecting changes
bloodstream, detect global changes within body, response that,
OVLT sets off certain events within brain body make either want
drink fluid stop drinking fluid. two main kinds thirst. first
one called osmotic thirst, second called hypovolemic thirst. Osmotic thirst
concentration salt bloodstream, say ingest
something very, salty. say ingest big bag of, confess don't eat
often, really like kettle potato chips, pretty salty. never
actually measured much sodium them. sure information there. Every
while, particularly interested so, just bag things,
really like them, salty, almost always make feel
thirsty, reason eating those, ingested lot sodium. Again, not
frequent occurrence me, happens every now again, don't
much shame think pretty healthy relationship food
enjoy them, understand will drive salt levels bloodstream,
will cause thirsty, why? Why? neurons OVLT come two
main varieties. One variety senses osmolarity blood getting across
weak little fence talked before, osmolarity, meaning salt
concentration blood, high, activates specific neurons OVLT,
activates, mean causes send electrical potentials, literally, send electrical
signals brain areas, brain areas inspire number different
downstream events, brain areas? Well, OVLT signals
area called supraoptic nucleus. name called supraoptic nucleus
not necessarily important. also signals so-called paraventricular nucleus,
another nucleus sits near ventricles can monitor qualities, chemical
qualities cerebrospinal fluid well as, probably, bloodstream well,
consequence communication particular hormone eventually released
posterior pituitary. Now, pituitary gland sits near roof
mouth. releases sorts things like growth hormone luteinizing hormone.
Luteinizing hormone will stimulate things like estrogen testosterone production
release ovaries testes on. pituitary bunch different
compartments functions, really cool pituitary certain
regions pituitary actually contain axons, wires neurons, neurons


reside brain, supraoptic nucleus gets signal OVLT.
signal purely form electrical activity. Remember, neurons aren't talking one
another happening there. not saying, "Psst! "Hey,
much salt bloodstream. "Let's something it." receive so-
called action potential, waves electricity. neurons supraoptic nucleus
release electrical signals within pituitary, neurons
nearby neurons capable releasing hormones well electrical signals,
pituitary, hormonal signal released called vasopressin. Vasopressin
also goes name antidiuretic hormone, antidiuretic hormone capacity
either restrict amount urine secrete, or, system turned off,
increase amount urine secrete, complicated set
cascades evoked high salt concentration blood. also
complicated set cascades evoked low concentrations sodium
blood, pathway nonetheless same. OVLT detecting
osmolarity changes, communicating supraoptic nucleus. Supraoptic nucleus
either causing release releasing vasopressin, antidiuretic hormone,
system shut off antidiuretic hormone not secreted, allow
urine flow freely, right? Antidiuretic means anti release urine, shutting
off, going cause release urine. sort allowing system
flow, speak. second category thirst hypovolemic thirst.

00:29:27 Blood Pressure & Thirst

Hypovolemic thirst occurs drop blood pressure, okay? OVLT,
mentioned before, can sense osmolarity based fact neurons
can detect much salt bloodstream, OVLT also harbors neurons
baroreceptor, mechanoreceptor category. Now, baroreceptors
mechanoreceptors later, baroreceptors essentially receptor, meaning
protein cell responds changes blood pressure, number
things can cause decreases blood pressure. include,
instance, lose lot blood, right? bleeding quite lot, cases,
vomit quite lot, extensive diarrhea combination those,
things can reduce blood volume, will talk
later, classic case hypovolemic thirst, one simply losing blood,


therefore, blood pressure goes down, simple imagine mind.
pipes, arteries, veins, capillaries, lose
blood volume, pressure arteries, veins, capillaries goes down. OVLT
neurons can sense reduction blood pressure presence
baroreceptors OVLT. elements also play response
call hypovolemic thirst. instance, kidney will secrete something called
renin. Renin will activate something called angiotensin II lungs, things,
amazing, angiotensin II can act OVLT, organum vasculosum lateral
terminalis, which, turn, will create thirst, okay? cases, right? osmolarity
sensing system, meaning osmotic thirst, hypovolemic thirst, blood pressure
dropped, end result desire drink more, desire drink
comes variety pathways direct indirect, include
vasopressin don't include vasopressin, think, just sake general example,
even don't biology background physiology
background, just understand two main types thirst. types thirst,
osmotic thirst hypovolemic thirst, not just seeking water, also
seeking salt. general terms, salt, aka sodium, can help retain water. Now,
doesn't mean salt always retains water. excessive amounts salt,
will retain excessive amounts water? Well, sort of. soon learn,
contextual, cases, can say salt system, brain
body can function normally provided levels salt adequate not
high low, thirst, often think just way bring fluid
body, designed kind interoceptive perception. mean that,
interoception, many know now listening podcast, paying
attention recognition, rather, conscious recognition events going within
body, thirsty, certain form interoception. go, "Oh, need
something crave something." may not know exactly need,
thirsty, not just seeking water; also seeking balance
osmolarity, means may seeking salty fluids foods, cases.
try accomplish eating, may trying avoid, will
inspired avoid salty fluids foods, want understand sodium
roles body, understand thirst, want understand thirst,
understand fluid balance regulated body. not surprising
all, sodium water work together order generate call thirst.



00:33:47 Kidneys & Urine Regulation

Sodium water work together order either retain water inspire us let go water,
urinate, can dive specifics around salt use salt
performance various recommendations things avoid, need drill little
bit deeper fluid balance mechanism body, reason,
pay least little bit attention kidney. kidney incredible organ,
one reasons kidney amazing responsible retaining,
holding onto, allowing release various substances body, substances
like glucose amino acids, urea, uric acid, salt, potassium, magnesium. basically
filter, very, intelligent filter. mean, intelligent meaning doesn't
mind, way works really beautiful. Basically, blood enters kidney
goes series tubes arranged loops. want look
this, beautiful Loop Henle aspects kidney design
allow certain substances retained substances released, depending
concentrated substances blood. kidney responds
number hormonal signals, including vasopressin, order to, instance, antidiuretic
hormone, order hold onto fluid brain body need,
responds hormonal signals well, pretty complex organ. Nonetheless,
key point, already mentioned, think people don't realize.
actually something like tell kids meet them, provided
appropriate age. say, oftentimes, kids learn scientist, ask
question something related science, hopefully, sake, something
neuroscience, one thing tell kids, say, "Do know urine,
pee, "is actually filtered blood?" occasionally, will really terrify kid,
also occasionally really terrifies adult, indeed, urine filtered blood.
Basically, blood gets kidney. kidney's going filter certain things.
Certain things going allowed pass others not, okay?
way kidney designed 90% stuff absorbed blood
going absorbed early series tubes, small percentage
going regulated worked get called distal kidney.
mean, distal just means furthest part away, okay? proximal close, like
shoulder proximal midline body, hand distal,


biological terms, hear proximal, distal, just means near far from,
just give really simple example, say low fluid. haven't
much drink while. Maybe walking around hot day. Chances
neurons OVLT will sense increase osmolarity, right?
concentration salt going increased relative fluid volume
circulating. This, course, assumes haven't excreted lot sodium one
reason another, increase osmolarity detected OVLT. OVLT
going signal bunch different cascades supraoptic nucleus, et cetera,
then, vasopressin going released bloodstream, vasopressin,
again, also called antidiuretic hormone, going act kidney change
kidney's function couple different ways, mechanical, chemical, okay?
order make sure kidney not release much water, doesn't make
want urinate, fact, even try urinate, body's going tend
hold onto fluid stores. simple, straightforward example. can also give
example whereby ingesting lot, lot, lot water, not
particularly hot day, not sweating much, assume salt intake
constant low whatever reason, well, then, osmolarity, salt concentration
blood, going lower. OVLT will detect
osmosensing neurons OVLT. OVLT will fail signal supraoptic
nucleus, will not release vasopressin antidiuretic hormone,
can excrete water body wants excrete, meaning able
urinate. no holding onto water level kidney, okay? simple
examples, hopefully, illustrates events within blood, meaning
concentration salt relative amount fluid, right? osmolarity is,
detected OVLT. brain communicates pituitary. pituitary sends
hormone blood, hormone acts kidney either hold onto
let go fluid, meaning prevent wanting urinate stimulating
want urinate. Very, simple kind yes/no-type situation here. lot
nuance reality. lot hormones pathway, think,

recommendation," can go back study mentioned earlier
episode, 2011 study, describe sort J-shaped curve which,
look occurrence negative health events, fairly low low
sodium intake, lower still slightly higher sodium intake, much line
recommendations made Dr. DiNicolantonio passed along me,
then, increased quite, health risks increased quite substantially one moves
past 6 grams sodium, 7 grams sodium per day. things really
seem get hazardous, really, makes sense, think, given consensus around
this, really avoid high salt intake, "The Salt Fix" describes rationale behind
recommendations. "The Salt Fix" also describes, quite beautiful detail,
relationship salt intake, potassium intake,

01:36:34 Perception Salt & Sugar Taste, Processed Foods

relationship sugar consumption system. like pick idea
relationship salt sugar think one key aspect way
salt can work can benefit us can harm us way sodium
sugar regulated actually perceived brain how, conditions
certain levels sodium intake, might inspired seek sugar crave
sweets less, now, talking salt substance

detected, much way sweet detectors bitter detectors,


detectors umami, savory flavor, tongue, earlier,
beginning episode, talked fact sweet receptors, neurons

pathways relate dopamine on. Well, also salt sensors various
locations throughout digestive tract, although sensation taste salt
actually exerts robust effect certain areas brain can either make us
crave sate, meaning fulfill, desire salt, can imagine
important. brain actually register whether not bringing
salt order know whether not going crave salt not,
beautiful work done Zuker Lab, Z-U-K-E-R, Zuker Lab Columbia
University, well many labs used imaging techniques
techniques molecular biology define so-called parallel pathways,
parallel meaning pathways represent sweet presence sweet taste
mouth gut, parallel pathways, meaning neural circuits represent presence
salty tastes mouth gut on, go brain, move
brain stem centers neocortex indeed seed
conscious perception give us sense perception components
foods happen ingesting sense perception fluids
components fluids happen ingesting. Now, parallel pathways,
describing them, fundamental feature every sensory system, not just
taste system, also visual system. parallel pathways perceiving dark
objects versus light objects, perceiving red versus green, et cetera.
fundamental feature built nervous system works,
taste system, much like systems, pathways indeed parallel,
converge, can influence one another, think simplest way put
context, first, visual system, whereby ability detect color
red everything fact neurons eye absorb long
wavelengths light call reds, red wavelengths light, longer
wavelengths than, say, blue light, shorter wavelength, really
comparison electrical activity neurons absorb red light activity
neurons absorb green light actually gives perception red,
might seem little counterintuitive, indeed, not. actually
something red less greenness perceive red green,


actually way entire nervous system works aren't really
good evaluating absolute levels anything context perception.
comparison, actually, fun experiment can do, think
probably find easily online, also experiment home. can
stare something red, green, matter, while, make active
decision not blink stare something red, look away
thing, actually see green afterimage red object. Conversely,
look something green while, stare it, look away,
will see red afterimage thing. Now, taste system doesn't quite
aftertaste type effect, nonetheless, pathways, parallel pathways
salty parallel pathways sweet bitter can actually interact,
important relevance context food choices sugar craving. One
things commonplace nowadays many processed foods business,
literally, business putting so-called hidden sugars, hidden sugars not
always form caloric sugars. sometimes form artificial
sweeteners various foods, might say, "Well, "why put
sugar food "and disguise sugary taste "given sweet tastes often
compel people "to eat things?" Well, way, actually, bypassing
homeostatic mechanisms sweet, even though might think
sweet stuff eat, sweet stuff crave, general, people

experience this. ever feel like something really, really sweet, take little sip
water little bit lemon juice vinegar, will quickly quench overly
sweet sensation perception. will disappear almost immediately. actually

idea cleansing palate. actually neutralizing
previous taste can bring yet another dish overindulge decadence
forth, sensory systems interact way. putting sugars foods
hiding sugary taste foods, foods, even contain artificial
sweeteners, can activate sorts neurons talked beginning
episode, like neuropod cells will signal brain release
dopamine make crave food, whereas able
perceive true sweetness food, might consumed less, indeed,
happens, hidden sugars kind diabolical. talking


context episode salt? Well, many probably
noticed, lot foods contain salty-sweet combination,
combination salty sweet can actually lead consume

01:47:13 Role Sodium Neuronal Function, Action Potentials

salty sweet interact. Now, thus far, already covered quite lot material,
completely remiss didn't emphasize crucial role sodium plays
way neurons function. fact, sodium one key elements allows
neurons function all, way engaging call action
potential. action potential firing electrical activity neurons. Now, neurons
can engage electrical activity number different ways. graded
potentials. gap junctions. whole landscape different
electrophysiologies neurons don't want go just yet, least not
episode, action potential fundamental way neurons communicate
one another. sometimes called spikes. just kind nomenclature
neuroscientists use. just going briefly describe action potential role
sodium plays, will involve little bit chemistry, promise will
accessible anyone, even don't chemistry physics background

things like genetic material. bunch things floating around
allow cells function, tend wire extending them,
sometimes long wire, sometimes short one, call axon,


end wire, axon, release little packets chemicals either cause

suppress action potentials neurons. way whole process occurs
given neuron needs change electrical activity, normally, neurons
hanging out, call negative charge, reason
negative charge inside cell things floating around like
potassium, little bit sodium, stuff like chloride. literally just, just
imagine little balls stuff, negative charge them,
inside cell going tend negative, outside cell, turns out,
going bunch stuff positively charged, one main
factors creating positive charge sodium. Sodium carries positive charge,
neurons can just imagine a, sake discussion, can just
imagine sphere little wire sticking it. can put little minus

neuron stimulated another neuron, stimulation, electrical stimulation
sufficiently high, meaning enough little packets neurotransmitter vomited

gaps open membrane cell separates inside outside,
positive, lot positive charge outside, lot
negative inside, like boulder running downhill. stuff tends rush downhill.
tries create even amounts charge, negative inside, positive

cell, consequence, charge cell goes negative, actually,
negative, quite positive, hits certain threshold positive charge
sodium ions going cell, fires called action potential,
vomits set chemicals onto next neuron, sets off chain one
neuron goes negative positive, blech, vomits chemicals onto next one.
next one, next neuron, binds receptors enters cell, cell
goes negative positive charge, [imitates vomiting] vomits contents onto

body. instance, regulates fluid balance, much fluid desire
much fluid excrete. also regulates desire salt itself, meaning salt
appetite. homeostatically driven salt appetite. talk mechanisms
today, make clear. means crave salty things,
beverages foods, salt stores low, tend avoid salty
beverages foods salt stores high, although not always
case. circumstances continue crave salt even though don't
need salt indeed even need eliminate salt system. Salt also
regulates appetite nutrients, things like sugar, things like carbohydrates,
today, explore that. Technically, salt mineral, mention


say salt, indeed referring sodium, cases, although will
clear distinguish salt sodium, meaning table salt sodium. people don't
realize this, one gram table salt contains 388 milligrams sodium,
technically, talking sodium today not salt. will use
interchangeably unless referring specific recommendations ideas
trying define ideal salt, aka sodium intake, okay? important. think,
right off bat, lot people get place confusion potentially
even place trouble thinking table salt grams always equates sodium
grams, simply not case. Today, going explore neural
mechanisms regulate salt appetite way brain body
interact context salt-seeking, salt avoidance, determine need
salt, need less salt.

00:17:13 Brain Senses Salt

talk kidney function. get it, going
systematically, start brain. harbor small sets neurons. call
sets neurons nuclei, meaning little clusters neurons, sense levels

regions very, special, special lack biological fences around
brain areas have, fences, say fence, goes

circulating around body not access brain, particular, large
molecules can't just pass brain. brain privileged organ sense.
couple organs privileged strict barriers,
particular fences, will, organs include things like ovaries
testes, makes sense following reason: First all, brain, least

important famous these, sake today's conversation, one called OVLT.


OVLT stands organum vasculosum lateral terminalis. called
circumventricular organ. circumventricular? Well, not bog

sake discussion, understand OVLT special. Why?
doesn't thick barrier fence, sounds like bad thing, yet terrific
border detector. neurons region able pay attention passing
bloodstream can detect, instance, levels sodium
bloodstream low, level blood pressure body low high,
then, OVLT can send signals brain areas, then, brain

cascades things allow regulate salt balance, turns
absolutely critical, not just ability think neurons work,
indeed, life. OVLT doesn't function correctly,

00:24:15 Salt & Thirst

effectively dead dead soon, important brain region, talk
function OVLT flesh aspects circuitry,
communication brain areas body context something


familiar with, thirst. ever wondered just get
thirsty? Well, neurons OVLT detecting changes
bloodstream, detect global changes within body, response that,
OVLT sets off certain events within brain body make either want
drink fluid stop drinking fluid. two main kinds thirst. first
one called osmotic thirst, second called hypovolemic thirst. Osmotic thirst
concentration salt bloodstream, say ingest
something very, salty. say ingest big bag of, confess don't eat
often, really like kettle potato chips, pretty salty. never
actually measured much sodium them. sure information there. Every
while, particularly interested so, just bag things,
really like them, salty, almost always make feel
thirsty, reason eating those, ingested lot sodium. Again, not
frequent occurrence me, happens every now again, don't
much shame think pretty healthy relationship food
enjoy them, understand will drive salt levels bloodstream,
will cause thirsty, why? Why? neurons OVLT come two
main varieties. One variety senses osmolarity blood getting across
weak little fence talked before, osmolarity, meaning salt
concentration blood, high, activates specific neurons OVLT,
activates, mean causes send electrical potentials, literally, send electrical
signals brain areas, brain areas inspire number different
downstream events, brain areas? Well, OVLT signals
area called supraoptic nucleus. name called supraoptic nucleus
not necessarily important. also signals so-called paraventricular nucleus,
another nucleus sits near ventricles can monitor qualities, chemical
qualities cerebrospinal fluid well as, probably, bloodstream well,
consequence communication particular hormone eventually released
posterior pituitary. Now, pituitary gland sits near roof
mouth. releases sorts things like growth hormone luteinizing hormone.
Luteinizing hormone will stimulate things like estrogen testosterone production
release ovaries testes on. pituitary bunch different
compartments functions, really cool pituitary certain
regions pituitary actually contain axons, wires neurons, neurons


reside brain, supraoptic nucleus gets signal OVLT.
signal purely form electrical activity. Remember, neurons aren't talking one
another happening there. not saying, "Psst! "Hey,
much salt bloodstream. "Let's something it." receive so-
called action potential, waves electricity. neurons supraoptic nucleus
release electrical signals within pituitary, neurons
nearby neurons capable releasing hormones well electrical signals,
pituitary, hormonal signal released called vasopressin. Vasopressin
also goes name antidiuretic hormone, antidiuretic hormone capacity
either restrict amount urine secrete, or, system turned off,
increase amount urine secrete, complicated set
cascades evoked high salt concentration blood. also
complicated set cascades evoked low concentrations sodium
blood, pathway nonetheless same. OVLT detecting
osmolarity changes, communicating supraoptic nucleus. Supraoptic nucleus
either causing release releasing vasopressin, antidiuretic hormone,
system shut off antidiuretic hormone not secreted, allow
urine flow freely, right? Antidiuretic means anti release urine, shutting
off, going cause release urine. sort allowing system
flow, speak. second category thirst hypovolemic thirst.

00:29:27 Blood Pressure & Thirst

Hypovolemic thirst occurs drop blood pressure, okay? OVLT,
mentioned before, can sense osmolarity based fact neurons
can detect much salt bloodstream, OVLT also harbors neurons
baroreceptor, mechanoreceptor category. Now, baroreceptors
mechanoreceptors later, baroreceptors essentially receptor, meaning
protein cell responds changes blood pressure, number
things can cause decreases blood pressure. include,
instance, lose lot blood, right? bleeding quite lot, cases,
vomit quite lot, extensive diarrhea combination those,
things can reduce blood volume, will talk
later, classic case hypovolemic thirst, one simply losing blood,


therefore, blood pressure goes down, simple imagine mind.
pipes, arteries, veins, capillaries, lose
blood volume, pressure arteries, veins, capillaries goes down. OVLT
neurons can sense reduction blood pressure presence
baroreceptors OVLT. elements also play response
call hypovolemic thirst. instance, kidney will secrete something called
renin. Renin will activate something called angiotensin II lungs, things,
amazing, angiotensin II can act OVLT, organum vasculosum lateral
terminalis, which, turn, will create thirst, okay? cases, right? osmolarity
sensing system, meaning osmotic thirst, hypovolemic thirst, blood pressure
dropped, end result desire drink more, desire drink
comes variety pathways direct indirect, include
vasopressin don't include vasopressin, think, just sake general example,
even don't biology background physiology
background, just understand two main types thirst. types thirst,
osmotic thirst hypovolemic thirst, not just seeking water, also
seeking salt. general terms, salt, aka sodium, can help retain water. Now,
doesn't mean salt always retains water. excessive amounts salt,
will retain excessive amounts water? Well, sort of. soon learn,
contextual, cases, can say salt system, brain
body can function normally provided levels salt adequate not
high low, thirst, often think just way bring fluid
body, designed kind interoceptive perception. mean that,
interoception, many know now listening podcast, paying
attention recognition, rather, conscious recognition events going within
body, thirsty, certain form interoception. go, "Oh, need
something crave something." may not know exactly need,
thirsty, not just seeking water; also seeking balance
osmolarity, means may seeking salty fluids foods, cases.
try accomplish eating, may trying avoid, will
inspired avoid salty fluids foods, want understand sodium
roles body, understand thirst, want understand thirst,
understand fluid balance regulated body. not surprising
all, sodium water work together order generate call thirst.



00:33:47 Kidneys & Urine Regulation

Sodium water work together order either retain water inspire us let go water,
urinate, can dive specifics around salt use salt
performance various recommendations things avoid, need drill little
bit deeper fluid balance mechanism body, reason,
pay least little bit attention kidney. kidney incredible organ,
one reasons kidney amazing responsible retaining,
holding onto, allowing release various substances body, substances
like glucose amino acids, urea, uric acid, salt, potassium, magnesium. basically
filter, very, intelligent filter. mean, intelligent meaning doesn't
mind, way works really beautiful. Basically, blood enters kidney
goes series tubes arranged loops. want look
this, beautiful Loop Henle aspects kidney design
allow certain substances retained substances released, depending
concentrated substances blood. kidney responds
number hormonal signals, including vasopressin, order to, instance, antidiuretic
hormone, order hold onto fluid brain body need,
responds hormonal signals well, pretty complex organ. Nonetheless,
key point, already mentioned, think people don't realize.
actually something like tell kids meet them, provided
appropriate age. say, oftentimes, kids learn scientist, ask
question something related science, hopefully, sake, something
neuroscience, one thing tell kids, say, "Do know urine,
pee, "is actually filtered blood?" occasionally, will really terrify kid,
also occasionally really terrifies adult, indeed, urine filtered blood.
Basically, blood gets kidney. kidney's going filter certain things.
Certain things going allowed pass others not, okay?
way kidney designed 90% stuff absorbed blood
going absorbed early series tubes, small percentage
going regulated worked get called distal kidney.
mean, distal just means furthest part away, okay? proximal close, like
shoulder proximal midline body, hand distal,


biological terms, hear proximal, distal, just means near far from,

then, increased quite, health risks increased quite substantially one moves
past 6 grams sodium, 7 grams sodium per day. things really
seem get hazardous, really, makes sense, think, given consensus around
this, really avoid high salt intake, "The Salt Fix" describes rationale behind
recommendations. "The Salt Fix" also describes, quite beautiful detail,

today, make clear. means crave salty things,
beverages foods, salt stores low, tend avoid salty
beverages foods salt stores high, although not always
case. circumstances continue crave salt even though don't
need salt indeed even need eliminate salt system. Salt also
regulates appetite nutrients, things like sugar, things like carbohydrates,
today, explore that. Technically, salt mineral, mention


say salt, indeed referring sodium, cases, although will
clear distinguish salt sodium, meaning table salt sodium. people don't
realize this, one gram table salt contains 388 milligrams sodium,
technically, talking sodium today not salt. will use
interchangeably unless referring specific recommendations ideas
trying define ideal salt, aka sodium intake, okay? important. think,
right off bat, lot people get place confusion potentially
even place trouble thinking table salt grams always equates sodium

absolutely critical, not just ability think neurons work,
indeed, life. OVLT doesn't function correctly,

00:24:15 Salt & Thirst

effectively dead dead soon, important brain region, talk

communication brain areas body context something


familiar with, thirst. ever wondered just get
thirsty? Well, neurons OVLT detecting changes
bloodstream, detect global changes within body, response that,
OVLT sets off certain events within brain body make either want
drink fluid stop drinking fluid. two main kinds thirst. first
one called osmotic thirst, second called hypovolemic thirst. Osmotic thirst
concentration salt bloodstream, say ingest
something very, salty. say ingest big bag of, confess don't eat
often, really like kettle potato chips, pretty salty. never
actually measured much sodium them. sure information there. Every
while, particularly interested so, just bag things,
really like them, salty, almost always make feel
thirsty, reason eating those, ingested lot sodium. Again, not
frequent occurrence me, happens every now again, don't
much shame think pretty healthy relationship food
enjoy them, understand will drive salt levels bloodstream,
will cause thirsty, why? Why? neurons OVLT come two
main varieties. One variety senses osmolarity blood getting across
weak little fence talked before, osmolarity, meaning salt
concentration blood, high, activates specific neurons OVLT,
activates, mean causes send electrical potentials, literally, send electrical
signals brain areas, brain areas inspire number different
downstream events, brain areas? Well, OVLT signals
area called supraoptic nucleus. name called supraoptic nucleus
not necessarily important. also signals so-called paraventricular nucleus,
another nucleus sits near ventricles can monitor qualities, chemical
qualities cerebrospinal fluid well as, probably, bloodstream well,
consequence communication particular hormone eventually released
posterior pituitary. Now, pituitary gland sits near roof
mouth. releases sorts things like growth hormone luteinizing hormone.
Luteinizing hormone will stimulate things like estrogen testosterone production
release ovaries testes on. pituitary bunch different
compartments functions, really cool pituitary certain
regions pituitary actually contain axons, wires neurons, neurons


reside brain, supraoptic nucleus gets signal OVLT.
signal purely form electrical activity. Remember, neurons aren't talking one
another happening there. not saying, "Psst! "Hey,
much salt bloodstream. "Let's something it." receive so-
called action potential, waves electricity. neurons supraoptic nucleus
release electrical signals within pituitary, neurons
nearby neurons capable releasing hormones well electrical signals,
pituitary, hormonal signal released called vasopressin. Vasopressin
also goes name antidiuretic hormone, antidiuretic hormone capacity
either restrict amount urine secrete, or, system turned off,
increase amount urine secrete, complicated set
cascades evoked high salt concentration blood. also
complicated set cascades evoked low concentrations sodium
blood, pathway nonetheless same. OVLT detecting
osmolarity changes, communicating supraoptic nucleus. Supraoptic nucleus
either causing release releasing vasopressin, antidiuretic hormone,
system shut off antidiuretic hormone not secreted, allow
urine flow freely, right? Antidiuretic means anti release urine, shutting
off, going cause release urine. sort allowing system
flow, speak. second category thirst hypovolemic thirst.

00:29:27 Blood Pressure & Thirst

Hypovolemic thirst occurs drop blood pressure, okay? OVLT,
mentioned before, can sense osmolarity based fact neurons
can detect much salt bloodstream, OVLT also harbors neurons
baroreceptor, mechanoreceptor category. Now, baroreceptors
mechanoreceptors later, baroreceptors essentially receptor, meaning
protein cell responds changes blood pressure, number
things can cause decreases blood pressure. include,
instance, lose lot blood, right? bleeding quite lot, cases,
vomit quite lot, extensive diarrhea combination those,
things can reduce blood volume, will talk
later, classic case hypovolemic thirst, one simply losing blood,


therefore, blood pressure goes down, simple imagine mind.
pipes, arteries, veins, capillaries, lose
blood volume, pressure arteries, veins, capillaries goes down. OVLT
neurons can sense reduction blood pressure presence
baroreceptors OVLT. elements also play response
call hypovolemic thirst. instance, kidney will secrete something called
renin. Renin will activate something called angiotensin II lungs, things,
amazing, angiotensin II can act OVLT, organum vasculosum lateral
terminalis, which, turn, will create thirst, okay? cases, right? osmolarity
sensing system, meaning osmotic thirst, hypovolemic thirst, blood pressure
dropped, end result desire drink more, desire drink
comes variety pathways direct indirect, include
vasopressin don't include vasopressin, think, just sake general example,
even don't biology background physiology
background, just understand two main types thirst. types thirst,
osmotic thirst hypovolemic thirst, not just seeking water, also
seeking salt. general terms, salt, aka sodium, can help retain water. Now,
doesn't mean salt always retains water. excessive amounts salt,
will retain excessive amounts water? Well, sort of. soon learn,
contextual, cases, can say salt system, brain
body can function normally provided levels salt adequate not
high low, thirst, often think just way bring fluid
body, designed kind interoceptive perception. mean that,
interoception, many know now listening podcast, paying
attention recognition, rather, conscious recognition events going within
body, thirsty, certain form interoception. go, "Oh, need
something crave something." may not know exactly need,
thirsty, not just seeking water; also seeking balance
osmolarity, means may seeking salty fluids foods, cases.
try accomplish eating, may trying avoid, will
inspired avoid salty fluids foods, want understand sodium
roles body, understand thirst, want understand thirst,
understand fluid balance regulated body. not surprising
all, sodium water work together order generate call thirst.



00:33:47 Kidneys & Urine Regulation

Sodium water work together order either retain water inspire us let go water,
urinate, can dive specifics around salt use salt
performance various recommendations things avoid, need drill little
bit deeper fluid balance mechanism body, reason,
pay least little bit attention kidney. kidney incredible organ,
one reasons kidney amazing responsible retaining,
holding onto, allowing release various substances body, substances
like glucose amino acids, urea, uric acid, salt, potassium, magnesium. basically
filter, very, intelligent filter. mean, intelligent meaning doesn't
mind, way works really beautiful. Basically, blood enters kidney
goes series tubes arranged loops. want look
this, beautiful Loop Henle aspects kidney design
allow certain substances retained substances released, depending
concentrated substances blood. kidney responds
number hormonal signals, including vasopressin, order to, instance, antidiuretic
hormone, order hold onto fluid brain body need,
responds hormonal signals well, pretty complex organ. Nonetheless,
key point, already mentioned, think people don't realize.
actually something like tell kids meet them, provided
appropriate age. say, oftentimes, kids learn scientist, ask
question something related science, hopefully, sake, something
neuroscience, one thing tell kids, say, "Do know urine,
pee, "is actually filtered blood?" occasionally, will really terrify kid,
also occasionally really terrifies adult, indeed, urine filtered blood.

kidney uses sodium order conserve water, everything
fact sodium can actually hold water. Put differently, water tends follow
sodium, sodium, tend water, sodium,
concentrated, can hold onto water, one main ways kidney holds

yes, indeed not holding onto water, fluid can excreted,
condition low sodium lasts long enough, start retain water
body recognizes, "Ah, salt low, water excreted," eventually, system

Again, recommendation passed along people,

then, increased quite, health risks increased quite substantially one moves
past 6 grams sodium, 7 grams sodium per day. things really
seem get hazardous, really, makes sense, think, given consensus around
this, really avoid high salt intake, "The Salt Fix" describes rationale behind
recommendations. "The Salt Fix" also describes, quite beautiful detail,

say salt, indeed referring sodium, cases, although will
clear distinguish salt sodium, meaning table salt sodium. people don't
realize this, one gram table salt contains 388 milligrams sodium,
technically, talking sodium today not salt. will use

00:24:15 Salt & Thirst

effectively dead dead soon, important brain region, talk

familiar with, thirst. ever wondered just get
thirsty? Well, neurons OVLT detecting changes
bloodstream, detect global changes within body, response that,
OVLT sets off certain events within brain body make either want
drink fluid stop drinking fluid. two main kinds thirst. first
one called osmotic thirst, second called hypovolemic thirst. Osmotic thirst
concentration salt bloodstream, say ingest
something very, salty. say ingest big bag of, confess don't eat
often, really like kettle potato chips, pretty salty. never
actually measured much sodium them. sure information there. Every
while, particularly interested so, just bag things,
really like them, salty, almost always make feel
thirsty, reason eating those, ingested lot sodium. Again, not
frequent occurrence me, happens every now again, don't
much shame think pretty healthy relationship food
enjoy them, understand will drive salt levels bloodstream,
will cause thirsty, why? Why? neurons OVLT come two
main varieties. One variety senses osmolarity blood getting across
weak little fence talked before, osmolarity, meaning salt
concentration blood, high, activates specific neurons OVLT,
activates, mean causes send electrical potentials, literally, send electrical
signals brain areas, brain areas inspire number different
downstream events, brain areas? Well, OVLT signals
area called supraoptic nucleus. name called supraoptic nucleus
not necessarily important. also signals so-called paraventricular nucleus,
another nucleus sits near ventricles can monitor qualities, chemical
qualities cerebrospinal fluid well as, probably, bloodstream well,
consequence communication particular hormone eventually released
posterior pituitary. Now, pituitary gland sits near roof
mouth. releases sorts things like growth hormone luteinizing hormone.
Luteinizing hormone will stimulate things like estrogen testosterone production
release ovaries testes on. pituitary bunch different
compartments functions, really cool pituitary certain
regions pituitary actually contain axons, wires neurons, neurons


reside brain, supraoptic nucleus gets signal OVLT.
signal purely form electrical activity. Remember, neurons aren't talking one
another happening there. not saying, "Psst! "Hey,
much salt bloodstream. "Let's something it." receive so-
called action potential, waves electricity. neurons supraoptic nucleus
release electrical signals within pituitary, neurons
nearby neurons capable releasing hormones well electrical signals,
pituitary, hormonal signal released called vasopressin. Vasopressin
also goes name antidiuretic hormone, antidiuretic hormone capacity
either restrict amount urine secrete, or, system turned off,
increase amount urine secrete, complicated set
cascades evoked high salt concentration blood. also
complicated set cascades evoked low concentrations sodium
blood, pathway nonetheless same. OVLT detecting
osmolarity changes, communicating supraoptic nucleus. Supraoptic nucleus
either causing release releasing vasopressin, antidiuretic hormone,
system shut off antidiuretic hormone not secreted, allow
urine flow freely, right? Antidiuretic means anti release urine, shutting
off, going cause release urine. sort allowing system
flow, speak. second category thirst hypovolemic thirst.

00:29:27 Blood Pressure & Thirst

Hypovolemic thirst occurs drop blood pressure, okay? OVLT,
mentioned before, can sense osmolarity based fact neurons
can detect much salt bloodstream, OVLT also harbors neurons
baroreceptor, mechanoreceptor category. Now, baroreceptors
mechanoreceptors later, baroreceptors essentially receptor, meaning
protein cell responds changes blood pressure, number
things can cause decreases blood pressure. include,
instance, lose lot blood, right? bleeding quite lot, cases,
vomit quite lot, extensive diarrhea combination those,
things can reduce blood volume, will talk
later, classic case hypovolemic thirst, one simply losing blood,


therefore, blood pressure goes down, simple imagine mind.
pipes, arteries, veins, capillaries, lose
blood volume, pressure arteries, veins, capillaries goes down. OVLT
neurons can sense reduction blood pressure presence
baroreceptors OVLT. elements also play response
call hypovolemic thirst. instance, kidney will secrete something called
renin. Renin will activate something called angiotensin II lungs, things,
amazing, angiotensin II can act OVLT, organum vasculosum lateral
terminalis, which, turn, will create thirst, okay? cases, right? osmolarity
sensing system, meaning osmotic thirst, hypovolemic thirst, blood pressure
dropped, end result desire drink more, desire drink
comes variety pathways direct indirect, include
vasopressin don't include vasopressin, think, just sake general example,
even don't biology background physiology
background, just understand two main types thirst. types thirst,
osmotic thirst hypovolemic thirst, not just seeking water, also
seeking salt. general terms, salt, aka sodium, can help retain water. Now,
doesn't mean salt always retains water. excessive amounts salt,
will retain excessive amounts water? Well, sort of. soon learn,
contextual, cases, can say salt system, brain
body can function normally provided levels salt adequate not
high low, thirst, often think just way bring fluid
body, designed kind interoceptive perception. mean that,
interoception, many know now listening podcast, paying
attention recognition, rather, conscious recognition events going within
body, thirsty, certain form interoception. go, "Oh, need
something crave something." may not know exactly need,
thirsty, not just seeking water; also seeking balance
osmolarity, means may seeking salty fluids foods, cases.
try accomplish eating, may trying avoid, will
inspired avoid salty fluids foods, want understand sodium
roles body, understand thirst, want understand thirst,
understand fluid balance regulated body. not surprising
all, sodium water work together order generate call thirst.



00:33:47 Kidneys & Urine Regulation

Sodium water work together order either retain water inspire us let go water,
urinate, can dive specifics around salt use salt
performance various recommendations things avoid, need drill little
bit deeper fluid balance mechanism body, reason,
pay least little bit attention kidney. kidney incredible organ,
one reasons kidney amazing responsible retaining,
holding onto, allowing release various substances body, substances
like glucose amino acids, urea, uric acid, salt, potassium, magnesium. basically
filter, very, intelligent filter. mean, intelligent meaning doesn't
mind, way works really beautiful. Basically, blood enters kidney
goes series tubes arranged loops. want look
this, beautiful Loop Henle aspects kidney design
allow certain substances retained substances released, depending
concentrated substances blood. kidney responds
number hormonal signals, including vasopressin, order to, instance, antidiuretic
hormone, order hold onto fluid brain body need,
responds hormonal signals well, pretty complex organ. Nonetheless,
key point, already mentioned, think people don't realize.
actually something like tell kids meet them, provided
appropriate age. say, oftentimes, kids learn scientist, ask
question something related science, hopefully, sake, something
neuroscience, one thing tell kids, say, "Do know urine,
pee, "is actually filtered blood?" occasionally, will really terrify kid,
also occasionally really terrifies adult, indeed, urine filtered blood.
Basically, blood gets kidney. kidney's going filter certain things.
Certain things going allowed pass others not, okay?
way kidney designed 90% stuff absorbed blood
going absorbed early series tubes, small percentage
going regulated worked get called distal kidney.
mean, distal just means furthest part away, okay? proximal close, like
shoulder proximal midline body, hand distal,


biological terms, hear proximal, distal, just means near far from,
just give really simple example, say low fluid. haven't
much drink while. Maybe walking around hot day. Chances
neurons OVLT will sense increase osmolarity, right?
concentration salt going increased relative fluid volume
circulating. This, course, assumes haven't excreted lot sodium one
reason another, increase osmolarity detected OVLT. OVLT
going signal bunch different cascades supraoptic nucleus, et cetera,
then, vasopressin going released bloodstream, vasopressin,
again, also called antidiuretic hormone, going act kidney change
kidney's function couple different ways, mechanical, chemical, okay?
order make sure kidney not release much water, doesn't make
want urinate, fact, even try urinate, body's going tend
hold onto fluid stores. simple, straightforward example. can also give
example whereby ingesting lot, lot, lot water, not
particularly hot day, not sweating much, assume salt intake
constant low whatever reason, well, then, osmolarity, salt concentration

Salt Fix." "The Salt Fix" interesting read points to, first all, history
salt society relates health. actually emphasizes major
missteps, maybe even pretty drastic errors, made terms trying
interpret role salt various diseases emphasizes ways
which, perhaps, increasing salt can actually improve health outcomes, think
strikes pretty nice balance commonly known salt
believe known salt, least taken consideration. book
provide certain recommendations, actually reached author. never
met person talked directly, asked outright. said, "How much
salt "do recommend people take average?" gave, course,
appropriate caveats prehypertension, hypertension, et cetera, made
recommendation just share you, want learn
support recommendation, can check book. recommendation
made anywhere 8 12 grams salt day, corresponds 3.2 4.8


grams sodium, going back current recommendations talked
before, 2.3 grams sodium per day, 1 1/2 times double amount
sodium currently recommended circles, then, corresponds
1 1/2 2 teaspoons salt per day arrive 3.2 4.8 grams sodium.
Again, recommendation passed along people,
conditions, barring specific health issues. Now, also interesting pointed
sodium-to-potassium ratio, 4 grams potassium, also mentioned 400
milligrams magnesium, pointed out, generally agree here, many people
deficient magnesium, again, 3.2 4.8 grams sodium, 4 grams
potassium. might think, "Well, gosh, "that's 1 1/2 2 times current
recommendation," can go back study mentioned earlier
episode, 2011 study, describe sort J-shaped curve which,
look occurrence negative health events, fairly low low
sodium intake, lower still slightly higher sodium intake, much line
recommendations made Dr. DiNicolantonio passed along me,
then, increased quite, health risks increased quite substantially one moves
past 6 grams sodium, 7 grams sodium per day. things really
seem get hazardous, really, makes sense, think, given consensus around
this, really avoid high salt intake, "The Salt Fix" describes rationale behind
recommendations. "The Salt Fix" also describes, quite beautiful detail,
relationship salt intake, potassium intake,

01:36:34 Perception Salt & Sugar Taste, Processed Foods

beautiful work done Zuker Lab, Z-U-K-E-R, Zuker Lab Columbia

foods happen ingesting sense perception fluids
components fluids happen ingesting. Now, parallel pathways,
describing them, fundamental feature every sensory system, not just
taste system, also visual system. parallel pathways perceiving dark

fundamental feature built nervous system works,
taste system, much like systems, pathways indeed parallel,

salty parallel pathways sweet bitter can actually interact,
important relevance context food choices sugar craving. One
things commonplace nowadays many processed foods business,
literally, business putting so-called hidden sugars, hidden sugars not

forth, sensory systems interact way. putting sugars foods
hiding sugary taste foods, foods, even contain artificial

01:47:13 Role Sodium Neuronal Function, Action Potentials

salty sweet interact. Now, thus far, already covered quite lot material,
completely remiss didn't emphasize crucial role sodium plays
way neurons function. fact, sodium one key elements allows
neurons function all, way engaging call action

given neuron needs change electrical activity, normally, neurons
hanging out, call negative charge, reason
negative charge inside cell things floating around like
potassium, little bit sodium, stuff like chloride. literally just, just
imagine little balls stuff, negative charge them,
inside cell going tend negative, outside cell, turns out,
going bunch stuff positively charged, one main
factors creating positive charge sodium. Sodium carries positive charge,
neurons can just imagine a, sake discussion, can just
imagine sphere little wire sticking it. can put little minus

00:24:15 Salt & Thirst

effectively dead dead soon, important brain region, talk
function OVLT flesh aspects circuitry,
communication brain areas body context something


familiar with, thirst. ever wondered just get
thirsty? Well, neurons OVLT detecting changes
bloodstream, detect global changes within body, response that,
OVLT sets off certain events within brain body make either want
drink fluid stop drinking fluid. two main kinds thirst. first
one called osmotic thirst, second called hypovolemic thirst. Osmotic thirst
concentration salt bloodstream, say ingest
something very, salty. say ingest big bag of, confess don't eat
often, really like kettle potato chips, pretty salty. never
actually measured much sodium them. sure information there. Every
while, particularly interested so, just bag things,
really like them, salty, almost always make feel
thirsty, reason eating those, ingested lot sodium. Again, not
frequent occurrence me, happens every now again, don't
much shame think pretty healthy relationship food
enjoy them, understand will drive salt levels bloodstream,
will cause thirsty, why? Why? neurons OVLT come two
main varieties. One variety senses osmolarity blood getting across
weak little fence talked before, osmolarity, meaning salt
concentration blood, high, activates specific neurons OVLT,
activates, mean causes send electrical potentials, literally, send electrical
signals brain areas, brain areas inspire number different
downstream events, brain areas? Well, OVLT signals
area called supraoptic nucleus. name called supraoptic nucleus
not necessarily important. also signals so-called paraventricular nucleus,
another nucleus sits near ventricles can monitor qualities, chemical
qualities cerebrospinal fluid well as, probably, bloodstream well,
consequence communication particular hormone eventually released
posterior pituitary. Now, pituitary gland sits near roof
mouth. releases sorts things like growth hormone luteinizing hormone.
Luteinizing hormone will stimulate things like estrogen testosterone production
release ovaries testes on. pituitary bunch different
compartments functions, really cool pituitary certain
regions pituitary actually contain axons, wires neurons, neurons


reside brain, supraoptic nucleus gets signal OVLT.
signal purely form electrical activity. Remember, neurons aren't talking one
another happening there. not saying, "Psst! "Hey,
much salt bloodstream. "Let's something it." receive so-
called action potential, waves electricity. neurons supraoptic nucleus
release electrical signals within pituitary, neurons
nearby neurons capable releasing hormones well electrical signals,
pituitary, hormonal signal released called vasopressin. Vasopressin
also goes name antidiuretic hormone, antidiuretic hormone capacity
either restrict amount urine secrete, or, system turned off,
increase amount urine secrete, complicated set
cascades evoked high salt concentration blood. also
complicated set cascades evoked low concentrations sodium
blood, pathway nonetheless same. OVLT detecting
osmolarity changes, communicating supraoptic nucleus. Supraoptic nucleus
either causing release releasing vasopressin, antidiuretic hormone,
system shut off antidiuretic hormone not secreted, allow
urine flow freely, right? Antidiuretic means anti release urine, shutting
off, going cause release urine. sort allowing system
flow, speak. second category thirst hypovolemic thirst.

00:29:27 Blood Pressure & Thirst

Hypovolemic thirst occurs drop blood pressure, okay? OVLT,
mentioned before, can sense osmolarity based fact neurons
can detect much salt bloodstream, OVLT also harbors neurons
baroreceptor, mechanoreceptor category. Now, baroreceptors
mechanoreceptors later, baroreceptors essentially receptor, meaning
protein cell responds changes blood pressure, number
things can cause decreases blood pressure. include,
instance, lose lot blood, right? bleeding quite lot, cases,
vomit quite lot, extensive diarrhea combination those,
things can reduce blood volume, will talk
later, classic case hypovolemic thirst, one simply losing blood,


therefore, blood pressure goes down, simple imagine mind.
pipes, arteries, veins, capillaries, lose
blood volume, pressure arteries, veins, capillaries goes down. OVLT
neurons can sense reduction blood pressure presence
baroreceptors OVLT. elements also play response
call hypovolemic thirst. instance, kidney will secrete something called
renin. Renin will activate something called angiotensin II lungs, things,
amazing, angiotensin II can act OVLT, organum vasculosum lateral
terminalis, which, turn, will create thirst, okay? cases, right? osmolarity
sensing system, meaning osmotic thirst, hypovolemic thirst, blood pressure
dropped, end result desire drink more, desire drink
comes variety pathways direct indirect, include
vasopressin don't include vasopressin, think, just sake general example,
even don't biology background physiology
background, just understand two main types thirst. types thirst,
osmotic thirst hypovolemic thirst, not just seeking water, also
seeking salt. general terms, salt, aka sodium, can help retain water. Now,
doesn't mean salt always retains water. excessive amounts salt,
will retain excessive amounts water? Well, sort of. soon learn,
contextual, cases, can say salt system, brain
body can function normally provided levels salt adequate not
high low, thirst, often think just way bring fluid
body, designed kind interoceptive perception. mean that,
interoception, many know now listening podcast, paying
attention recognition, rather, conscious recognition events going within
body, thirsty, certain form interoception. go, "Oh, need
something crave something." may not know exactly need,
thirsty, not just seeking water; also seeking balance
osmolarity, means may seeking salty fluids foods, cases.
try accomplish eating, may trying avoid, will
inspired avoid salty fluids foods, want understand sodium
roles body, understand thirst, want understand thirst,
understand fluid balance regulated body. not surprising
all, sodium water work together order generate call thirst.



00:33:47 Kidneys & Urine Regulation

Sodium water work together order either retain water inspire us let go water,
urinate, can dive specifics around salt use salt
performance various recommendations things avoid, need drill little
bit deeper fluid balance mechanism body, reason,
pay least little bit attention kidney. kidney incredible organ,
one reasons kidney amazing responsible retaining,
holding onto, allowing release various substances body, substances
like glucose amino acids, urea, uric acid, salt, potassium, magnesium. basically
filter, very, intelligent filter. mean, intelligent meaning doesn't
mind, way works really beautiful. Basically, blood enters kidney
goes series tubes arranged loops. want look
this, beautiful Loop Henle aspects kidney design
allow certain substances retained substances released, depending
concentrated substances blood. kidney responds
number hormonal signals, including vasopressin, order to, instance, antidiuretic
hormone, order hold onto fluid brain body need,
responds hormonal signals well, pretty complex organ. Nonetheless,
key point, already mentioned, think people don't realize.
actually something like tell kids meet them, provided
appropriate age. say, oftentimes, kids learn scientist, ask
question something related science, hopefully, sake, something
neuroscience, one thing tell kids, say, "Do know urine,
pee, "is actually filtered blood?" occasionally, will really terrify kid,
also occasionally really terrifies adult, indeed, urine filtered blood.
Basically, blood gets kidney. kidney's going filter certain things.
Certain things going allowed pass others not, okay?
way kidney designed 90% stuff absorbed blood
going absorbed early series tubes, small percentage
going regulated worked get called distal kidney.
mean, distal just means furthest part away, okay? proximal close, like
shoulder proximal midline body, hand distal,


biological terms, hear proximal, distal, just means near far from,
just give really simple example, say low fluid. haven't
much drink while. Maybe walking around hot day. Chances
neurons OVLT will sense increase osmolarity, right?
concentration salt going increased relative fluid volume
circulating. This, course, assumes haven't excreted lot sodium one
reason another, increase osmolarity detected OVLT. OVLT
going signal bunch different cascades supraoptic nucleus, et cetera,
then, vasopressin going released bloodstream, vasopressin,
again, also called antidiuretic hormone, going act kidney change
kidney's function couple different ways, mechanical, chemical, okay?
order make sure kidney not release much water, doesn't make
want urinate, fact, even try urinate, body's going tend
hold onto fluid stores. simple, straightforward example. can also give
example whereby ingesting lot, lot, lot water, not
particularly hot day, not sweating much, assume salt intake
constant low whatever reason, well, then, osmolarity, salt concentration
blood, going lower. OVLT will detect
osmosensing neurons OVLT. OVLT will fail signal supraoptic
nucleus, will not release vasopressin antidiuretic hormone,
can excrete water body wants excrete, meaning able
urinate. no holding onto water level kidney, okay? simple
examples, hopefully, illustrates events within blood, meaning
concentration salt relative amount fluid, right? osmolarity is,
detected OVLT. brain communicates pituitary. pituitary sends
hormone blood, hormone acts kidney either hold onto
let go fluid, meaning prevent wanting urinate stimulating
want urinate. Very, simple kind yes/no-type situation here. lot
nuance reality. lot hormones pathway, think,
least stage discussion,

00:39:08 Vasopressin: Roles Libido & Urination

sufficient. may noticed molecule


talking lot today, vasopressin, also mentioned previous episode
Huberman Lab Podcast, different context. molecule referring
vasopressin, and, mentioned, hormone involved antidiuresis, meaning
preventing urination. antidiuretic, also talked vasopressin
context desire, love, attachment. talked context monogamy
nonmonogamy species animal called prairie vole. can check
episode. believe vasopressin nonmonogamous prairie voles mentioned
timestamp, easy find. Vasopressin made multiple locations
nervous system, mainly supraoptic nucleus, indeed, also involved aspects
sexual behavior mating. Now, mechanisms distinct
antidiuretic effects. fact, people take vasopressin
aphrodisiac. Now, certainly not suggesting people that,
confidence world moment talk vasopressin, someone
comments going say, "What think vasopressin nasal sprays "and
kind thing?" Vasopressin, indeed oxytocin, another hormone involved
pair bonding various aspects brain body function, available nasal
sprays can get deep recesses brain can impact
core call hypothalamic functions, primitive drives hypothalamic
functions. encourage lot caution, maybe even extreme caution
recreational use things like vasopressin oxytocin unless working MD,
MD, excuse me, prescribe really know doing.
powerful hormones lot different effects brain body.
way vasopressin, meaning antidiuretic hormone, prevents release fluid
urine body pretty interesting. acts directly kidney, so, mentioned
before, blood flows kidney. number things retained early part
kidney. Vasopressin acts fairly distal, meaning kind end game part
loops tubes kidney, increases permeability tubes.
words, makes sure fluid otherwise pass collecting duct
go bladder never actually makes bladder. point
antidiuretic hormone prevents bladder filling all.
not locks fluid bladder prevents urinating. think way
describing things now way hear antidiuretic hormone,
might sound like kind locks bladder prevents able
urinate, full bladder. uncomfortable. not


way works. actually causes tubes headed towards bladder kidney
become permeable, meaning allow fluid go back bloodstream, rest
body, fluid never actually fills bladder, never feel urge
urinate. Now, episode salt. key thing understand kidney
kidney uses sodium order conserve water, everything
fact sodium can actually hold water. Put differently, water tends follow
sodium, sodium, tend water, sodium,
concentrated, can hold onto water, one main ways kidney holds

beautiful work done Zuker Lab, Z-U-K-E-R, Zuker Lab Columbia
University, well many labs used imaging techniques
techniques molecular biology define so-called parallel pathways,
parallel meaning pathways represent sweet presence sweet taste
mouth gut, parallel pathways, meaning neural circuits represent presence
salty tastes mouth gut on, go brain, move
brain stem centers neocortex indeed seed
conscious perception give us sense perception components
foods happen ingesting sense perception fluids
components fluids happen ingesting. Now, parallel pathways,
describing them, fundamental feature every sensory system, not just
taste system, also visual system. parallel pathways perceiving dark
objects versus light objects, perceiving red versus green, et cetera.
fundamental feature built nervous system works,
taste system, much like systems, pathways indeed parallel,
converge, can influence one another, think simplest way put
context, first, visual system, whereby ability detect color
red everything fact neurons eye absorb long
wavelengths light call reds, red wavelengths light, longer
wavelengths than, say, blue light, shorter wavelength, really
comparison electrical activity neurons absorb red light activity
neurons absorb green light actually gives perception red,
might seem little counterintuitive, indeed, not. actually
something red less greenness perceive red green,


actually way entire nervous system works aren't really
good evaluating absolute levels anything context perception.
comparison, actually, fun experiment can do, think
probably find easily online, also experiment home. can
stare something red, green, matter, while, make active
decision not blink stare something red, look away
thing, actually see green afterimage red object. Conversely,
look something green while, stare it, look away,
will see red afterimage thing. Now, taste system doesn't quite

salty parallel pathways sweet bitter can actually interact,
important relevance context food choices sugar craving. One
things commonplace nowadays many processed foods business,
literally, business putting so-called hidden sugars, hidden sugars not
always form caloric sugars. sometimes form artificial
sweeteners various foods, might say, "Well, "why put
sugar food "and disguise sugary taste "given sweet tastes often
compel people "to eat things?" Well, way, actually, bypassing
homeostatic mechanisms sweet, even though might think
sweet stuff eat, sweet stuff crave, general, people

01:47:13 Role Sodium Neuronal Function, Action Potentials

salty sweet interact. Now, thus far, already covered quite lot material,
completely remiss didn't emphasize crucial role sodium plays
way neurons function. fact, sodium one key elements allows
neurons function all, way engaging call action
potential. action potential firing electrical activity neurons. Now, neurons
can engage electrical activity number different ways. graded
potentials. gap junctions. whole landscape different
electrophysiologies neurons don't want go just yet, least not
episode, action potential fundamental way neurons communicate
one another. sometimes called spikes. just kind nomenclature
neuroscientists use. just going briefly describe action potential role
sodium plays, will involve little bit chemistry, promise will
accessible anyone, even don't chemistry physics background
electrophysiology background. Neurons inside outside, inside
things like genetic material. bunch things floating around
allow cells function, tend wire extending them,
sometimes long wire, sometimes short one, call axon,


end wire, axon, release little packets chemicals either cause
next neuron fire action potentials prevent next neuron firing action
potentials, kind vomit little packets chemicals either inspire
suppress action potentials neurons. way whole process occurs
given neuron needs change electrical activity, normally, neurons
hanging out, call negative charge, reason
negative charge inside cell things floating around like
potassium, little bit sodium, stuff like chloride. literally just, just
imagine little balls stuff, negative charge them,
inside cell going tend negative, outside cell, turns out,
going bunch stuff positively charged, one main
factors creating positive charge sodium. Sodium carries positive charge,
neurons can just imagine a, sake discussion, can just
imagine sphere little wire sticking it. can put little minus
inside negative. can put little plus outside positive,
neuron stimulated another neuron, stimulation, electrical stimulation
sufficiently high, meaning enough little packets neurotransmitter vomited
onto surface sufficient concentration, happens little pores, little spaces, little
gaps open membrane cell separates inside outside,
positive, lot positive charge outside, lot
negative inside, like boulder running downhill. stuff tends rush downhill.
tries create even amounts charge, negative inside, positive
outside, happens sodium rushes cell carrying lot charge
cell, consequence, charge cell goes negative, actually,
negative, quite positive, hits certain threshold positive charge
sodium ions going cell, fires called action potential,
vomits set chemicals onto next neuron, sets off chain one
neuron goes negative positive, blech, vomits chemicals onto next one.
next one, next neuron, binds receptors enters cell, cell
goes negative positive charge, [imitates vomiting] vomits contents onto

organum vasculosum lateral terminalis, neurons can sense contents
blood and, extent, cerebrospinal fluid. couple brain
areas can well. go also name circumventricular organs,
talk names areas, today, think
sake discussion, understand OVLT special. Why?
doesn't thick barrier fence, sounds like bad thing, yet terrific
border detector. neurons region able pay attention passing
bloodstream can detect, instance, levels sodium
bloodstream low, level blood pressure body low high,
then, OVLT can send signals brain areas, then, brain
areas can things like release hormones can go act tissues call
periphery, body, and, instance, kidneys secrete urine get
rid salt excessive salt body kidneys hold onto urine, hold
onto whatever water fluid one might need, go deeper
pathway, just understand OVLT limited barrier. can detect things
bloodstream, incredible area brain, almost single-handedly, sets off
cascades things allow regulate salt balance, turns
absolutely critical, not just ability think neurons work,
indeed, life. OVLT doesn't function correctly,

00:24:15 Salt & Thirst

effectively dead dead soon, important brain region, talk
function OVLT flesh aspects circuitry,
communication brain areas body context something


familiar with, thirst. ever wondered just get
thirsty? Well, neurons OVLT detecting changes
bloodstream, detect global changes within body, response that,
OVLT sets off certain events within brain body make either want
drink fluid stop drinking fluid. two main kinds thirst. first
one called osmotic thirst, second called hypovolemic thirst. Osmotic thirst
concentration salt bloodstream, say ingest
something very, salty. say ingest big bag of, confess don't eat
often, really like kettle potato chips, pretty salty. never
actually measured much sodium them. sure information there. Every
while, particularly interested so, just bag things,
really like them, salty, almost always make feel
thirsty, reason eating those, ingested lot sodium. Again, not
frequent occurrence me, happens every now again, don't
much shame think pretty healthy relationship food
enjoy them, understand will drive salt levels bloodstream,
will cause thirsty, why? Why? neurons OVLT come two
main varieties. One variety senses osmolarity blood getting across
weak little fence talked before, osmolarity, meaning salt
concentration blood, high, activates specific neurons OVLT,
activates, mean causes send electrical potentials, literally, send electrical
signals brain areas, brain areas inspire number different
downstream events, brain areas? Well, OVLT signals
area called supraoptic nucleus. name called supraoptic nucleus
not necessarily important. also signals so-called paraventricular nucleus,
another nucleus sits near ventricles can monitor qualities, chemical
qualities cerebrospinal fluid well as, probably, bloodstream well,
consequence communication particular hormone eventually released
posterior pituitary. Now, pituitary gland sits near roof
mouth. releases sorts things like growth hormone luteinizing hormone.
Luteinizing hormone will stimulate things like estrogen testosterone production
release ovaries testes on. pituitary bunch different
compartments functions, really cool pituitary certain
regions pituitary actually contain axons, wires neurons, neurons


reside brain, supraoptic nucleus gets signal OVLT.
signal purely form electrical activity. Remember, neurons aren't talking one
another happening there. not saying, "Psst! "Hey,
much salt bloodstream. "Let's something it." receive so-
called action potential, waves electricity. neurons supraoptic nucleus
release electrical signals within pituitary, neurons
nearby neurons capable releasing hormones well electrical signals,
pituitary, hormonal signal released called vasopressin. Vasopressin
also goes name antidiuretic hormone, antidiuretic hormone capacity
either restrict amount urine secrete, or, system turned off,
increase amount urine secrete, complicated set
cascades evoked high salt concentration blood. also
complicated set cascades evoked low concentrations sodium
blood, pathway nonetheless same. OVLT detecting
osmolarity changes, communicating supraoptic nucleus. Supraoptic nucleus
either causing release releasing vasopressin, antidiuretic hormone,
system shut off antidiuretic hormone not secreted, allow
urine flow freely, right? Antidiuretic means anti release urine, shutting
off, going cause release urine. sort allowing system
flow, speak. second category thirst hypovolemic thirst.

00:29:27 Blood Pressure & Thirst

Hypovolemic thirst occurs drop blood pressure, okay? OVLT,
mentioned before, can sense osmolarity based fact neurons
can detect much salt bloodstream, OVLT also harbors neurons
baroreceptor, mechanoreceptor category. Now, baroreceptors
mechanoreceptors later, baroreceptors essentially receptor, meaning
protein cell responds changes blood pressure, number
things can cause decreases blood pressure. include,
instance, lose lot blood, right? bleeding quite lot, cases,
vomit quite lot, extensive diarrhea combination those,
things can reduce blood volume, will talk
later, classic case hypovolemic thirst, one simply losing blood,


therefore, blood pressure goes down, simple imagine mind.
pipes, arteries, veins, capillaries, lose
blood volume, pressure arteries, veins, capillaries goes down. OVLT
neurons can sense reduction blood pressure presence
baroreceptors OVLT. elements also play response
call hypovolemic thirst. instance, kidney will secrete something called
renin. Renin will activate something called angiotensin II lungs, things,
amazing, angiotensin II can act OVLT, organum vasculosum lateral
terminalis, which, turn, will create thirst, okay? cases, right? osmolarity
sensing system, meaning osmotic thirst, hypovolemic thirst, blood pressure
dropped, end result desire drink more, desire drink
comes variety pathways direct indirect, include
vasopressin don't include vasopressin, think, just sake general example,
even don't biology background physiology
background, just understand two main types thirst. types thirst,
osmotic thirst hypovolemic thirst, not just seeking water, also
seeking salt. general terms, salt, aka sodium, can help retain water. Now,
doesn't mean salt always retains water. excessive amounts salt,
will retain excessive amounts water? Well, sort of. soon learn,
contextual, cases, can say salt system, brain
body can function normally provided levels salt adequate not
high low, thirst, often think just way bring fluid
body, designed kind interoceptive perception. mean that,
interoception, many know now listening podcast, paying
attention recognition, rather, conscious recognition events going within
body, thirsty, certain form interoception. go, "Oh, need
something crave something." may not know exactly need,
thirsty, not just seeking water; also seeking balance
osmolarity, means may seeking salty fluids foods, cases.
try accomplish eating, may trying avoid, will
inspired avoid salty fluids foods, want understand sodium
roles body, understand thirst, want understand thirst,
understand fluid balance regulated body. not surprising
all, sodium water work together order generate call thirst.



00:33:47 Kidneys & Urine Regulation

Sodium water work together order either retain water inspire us let go water,
urinate, can dive specifics around salt use salt
performance various recommendations things avoid, need drill little
bit deeper fluid balance mechanism body, reason,
pay least little bit attention kidney. kidney incredible organ,
one reasons kidney amazing responsible retaining,
holding onto, allowing release various substances body, substances
like glucose amino acids, urea, uric acid, salt, potassium, magnesium. basically
filter, very, intelligent filter. mean, intelligent meaning doesn't
mind, way works really beautiful. Basically, blood enters kidney
goes series tubes arranged loops. want look
this, beautiful Loop Henle aspects kidney design
allow certain substances retained substances released, depending
concentrated substances blood. kidney responds
number hormonal signals, including vasopressin, order to, instance, antidiuretic
hormone, order hold onto fluid brain body need,
responds hormonal signals well, pretty complex organ. Nonetheless,
key point, already mentioned, think people don't realize.
actually something like tell kids meet them, provided
appropriate age. say, oftentimes, kids learn scientist, ask
question something related science, hopefully, sake, something
neuroscience, one thing tell kids, say, "Do know urine,
pee, "is actually filtered blood?" occasionally, will really terrify kid,
also occasionally really terrifies adult, indeed, urine filtered blood.
Basically, blood gets kidney. kidney's going filter certain things.
Certain things going allowed pass others not, okay?
way kidney designed 90% stuff absorbed blood
going absorbed early series tubes, small percentage
going regulated worked get called distal kidney.
mean, distal just means furthest part away, okay? proximal close, like
shoulder proximal midline body, hand distal,


biological terms, hear proximal, distal, just means near far from,
just give really simple example, say low fluid. haven't
much drink while. Maybe walking around hot day. Chances
neurons OVLT will sense increase osmolarity, right?
concentration salt going increased relative fluid volume
circulating. This, course, assumes haven't excreted lot sodium one
reason another, increase osmolarity detected OVLT. OVLT
going signal bunch different cascades supraoptic nucleus, et cetera,
then, vasopressin going released bloodstream, vasopressin,
again, also called antidiuretic hormone, going act kidney change
kidney's function couple different ways, mechanical, chemical, okay?
order make sure kidney not release much water, doesn't make
want urinate, fact, even try urinate, body's going tend
hold onto fluid stores. simple, straightforward example. can also give
example whereby ingesting lot, lot, lot water, not
particularly hot day, not sweating much, assume salt intake
constant low whatever reason, well, then, osmolarity, salt concentration
blood, going lower. OVLT will detect
osmosensing neurons OVLT. OVLT will fail signal supraoptic
nucleus, will not release vasopressin antidiuretic hormone,
can excrete water body wants excrete, meaning able
urinate. no holding onto water level kidney, okay? simple
examples, hopefully, illustrates events within blood, meaning
concentration salt relative amount fluid, right? osmolarity is,
detected OVLT. brain communicates pituitary. pituitary sends
hormone blood, hormone acts kidney either hold onto
let go fluid, meaning prevent wanting urinate stimulating
want urinate. Very, simple kind yes/no-type situation here. lot
nuance reality. lot hormones pathway, think,
least stage discussion,

00:39:08 Vasopressin: Roles Libido & Urination

sufficient. may noticed molecule


talking lot today, vasopressin, also mentioned previous episode
Huberman Lab Podcast, different context. molecule referring
vasopressin, and, mentioned, hormone involved antidiuresis, meaning
preventing urination. antidiuretic, also talked vasopressin
context desire, love, attachment. talked context monogamy
nonmonogamy species animal called prairie vole. can check
episode. believe vasopressin nonmonogamous prairie voles mentioned
timestamp, easy find. Vasopressin made multiple locations
nervous system, mainly supraoptic nucleus, indeed, also involved aspects
sexual behavior mating. Now, mechanisms distinct
antidiuretic effects. fact, people take vasopressin
aphrodisiac. Now, certainly not suggesting people that,
confidence world moment talk vasopressin, someone
comments going say, "What think vasopressin nasal sprays "and
kind thing?" Vasopressin, indeed oxytocin, another hormone involved
pair bonding various aspects brain body function, available nasal
sprays can get deep recesses brain can impact
core call hypothalamic functions, primitive drives hypothalamic
functions. encourage lot caution, maybe even extreme caution
recreational use things like vasopressin oxytocin unless working MD,
MD, excuse me, prescribe really know doing.
powerful hormones lot different effects brain body.
way vasopressin, meaning antidiuretic hormone, prevents release fluid
urine body pretty interesting. acts directly kidney, so, mentioned
before, blood flows kidney. number things retained early part
kidney. Vasopressin acts fairly distal, meaning kind end game part
loops tubes kidney, increases permeability tubes.
words, makes sure fluid otherwise pass collecting duct
go bladder never actually makes bladder. point
antidiuretic hormone prevents bladder filling all.
not locks fluid bladder prevents urinating. think way
describing things now way hear antidiuretic hormone,
might sound like kind locks bladder prevents able
urinate, full bladder. uncomfortable. not


way works. actually causes tubes headed towards bladder kidney
become permeable, meaning allow fluid go back bloodstream, rest
body, fluid never actually fills bladder, never feel urge
urinate. Now, episode salt. key thing understand kidney
kidney uses sodium order conserve water, everything
fact sodium can actually hold water. Put differently, water tends follow
sodium, sodium, tend water, sodium,
concentrated, can hold onto water, one main ways kidney holds
onto water body, soon learn, no simple direct formula
say, instance, "Okay, salt levels high, lot water retained, "and salt
levels low, lot water released." one hand, can true, also
case systems homeostatic, meaning always seeking
balance, within system, within salt system, systems, salt
water system. also case, often, enough sodium, well, can
secrete sodium water will follow, don't enough sodium, then,
yes, indeed not holding onto water, fluid can excreted,
condition low sodium lasts long enough, start retain water
body recognizes, "Ah, salt low, water excreted," eventually, system
will kick retain water, love give simple black-and-white, yes-or-no
answer low sodium, high sodium, moderate sodium, water balance,
contextual, say contextual, mean, will depend blood pressure,
hypertension, prehypertension, there, maybe normal tension, hormone levels,
exercise, et cetera, et cetera. pretty good example complicated can
one may familiar with. pretty well known certain
phases menstrual cycle, estrogen progesterone hormones
fluctuating, water can retained body. called edema,
swelling, sometimes, common assumption, indeed, can true,
estrogen levels high, water retention body. Also, males, estrogen
levels high, can water retention body. one reasons
athletes and, particular, bodybuilders take anabolic steroids like testosterone,
can converted estrogens, sometimes look, walk around,
look like partially inflated. look like going pop, looks like
swelling skin, not just large muscles, not always,
often, water retention due testosterone conversion estrogen. Now,


sounds consistent, right? Estrogen levels fluctuate menstrual cycle. males,
increase estrogen, retention water, actually, estrogen
acts diuretic, one think, "Okay, estrogen levels go up, "there
lot fluid excreted," bring example point
complicated dynamic balance hormones salt fluid. can't draw
one-to-one relationship there, turns important point,
can use that, not way complicate things, way understand
contexts

00:45:46 Much Salt Need?

less sodium intake sodium intake can beneficial, like
turn attention now, much salt need? can trust terms
trying guide ingestion salt? First all, want very, clear
number people prehypertension hypertension. need

immediate long-term health outcomes. informs lot do.
cardiovascular exercise? ingesting
less salt? adjusting number different lifestyle factors? need
know that, without knowing blood pressure is, can't give one-size-
fits-all recommendation, indeed, not going give medical recommendations.
simply going spell know research, which, hopefully, will point
direction figuring right terms salt indeed fluid intake.
school thought everybody consuming much salt, want
highlight fact dozens, not hundreds, quality papers point
fact a, quote-unquote, high salt diet can bad various organs tissues
body, including brain. just happens fluid balance, inside
outside cells, crucial, not just heart lungs liver
organs body, also brain, salt concentration inside

low inside cells tissue body, brain included, cells
body brain can shrink water pulled extracellular space, away
cells, indeed, conditions, brain function can suffer, indeed,
overall health brain can suffer, many reports indicating,
experimental models and, extent, humans, overconsumption salt
bad brain function longevity, yet also decent evidence,
animal models humans, salt consumption low, brain health
longevity will suffer, will organs tissues body, so, like things
biology, don't want things high low. Now, say vast majority
studies point fact high-salt diet detrimental brain health
function. studies focused aspect salt balance
consequences brain function. One critical issue many studies, however,
high-salt diet often coupled elements diet also unhealthy,
things like excessively high levels carbohydrates fats combinations
carbohydrates fats, know many burning questions
much salt one needs low-carbohydrate diet
fasting vegan diet, simply not many studies
explored low, moderate, high-salt conditions backdrop controlled

controlled nutrition studies there. some, course, hard get
people adhere nutritional plans strict way, sufficient
periods time allow various health outcomes occur. Nonetheless,
interesting reports indicate amount salt intake can indeed
predict health outcomes call hazardous events, things like cardiovascular
events stroke forth, interesting indeed lower, not
saying low, right? don't believe want diet truly low
anything except, perhaps, poison, lower-salt diet can reduce number
so-called hazardous events, somewhat shallow U-shaped function
that, yes indeed, high salt intake can detrimental health, terms
cardiovascular events, stroke, deleterious health events, somewhere
middle actually sits quite right, meaning higher typically
recommended salt intake, can actually reduce number hazardous

neural pathways

01:47:13 Role Sodium Neuronal Function, Action Potentials

salty sweet interact. Now, thus far, already covered quite lot material,
completely remiss didn't emphasize crucial role sodium plays
way neurons function. fact, sodium one key elements allows
neurons function all, way engaging call action
potential. action potential firing electrical activity neurons. Now, neurons
can engage electrical activity number different ways. graded
potentials. gap junctions. whole landscape different
electrophysiologies neurons don't want go just yet, least not
episode, action potential fundamental way neurons communicate
one another. sometimes called spikes. just kind nomenclature
neuroscientists use. just going briefly describe action potential role
sodium plays, will involve little bit chemistry, promise will
accessible anyone, even don't chemistry physics background
electrophysiology background. Neurons inside outside, inside
things like genetic material. bunch things floating around
allow cells function, tend wire extending them,
sometimes long wire, sometimes short one, call axon,


end wire, axon, release little packets chemicals either cause
next neuron fire action potentials prevent next neuron firing action
potentials, kind vomit little packets chemicals either inspire
suppress action potentials neurons. way whole process occurs
given neuron needs change electrical activity, normally, neurons
hanging out, call negative charge, reason
negative charge inside cell things floating around like
potassium, little bit sodium, stuff like chloride. literally just, just
imagine little balls stuff, negative charge them,
inside cell going tend negative, outside cell, turns out,
going bunch stuff positively charged, one main
factors creating positive charge sodium. Sodium carries positive charge,
neurons can just imagine a, sake discussion, can just
imagine sphere little wire sticking it. can put little minus
inside negative. can put little plus outside positive,
neuron stimulated another neuron, stimulation, electrical stimulation
sufficiently high, meaning enough little packets neurotransmitter vomited
onto surface sufficient concentration, happens little pores, little spaces, little
gaps open membrane cell separates inside outside,
positive, lot positive charge outside, lot
negative inside, like boulder running downhill. stuff tends rush downhill.
tries create even amounts charge, negative inside, positive
outside, happens sodium rushes cell carrying lot charge
cell, consequence, charge cell goes negative, actually,
negative, quite positive, hits certain threshold positive charge
sodium ions going cell, fires called action potential,
vomits set chemicals onto next neuron, sets off chain one
neuron goes negative positive, blech, vomits chemicals onto next one.
next one, next neuron, binds receptors enters cell, cell
goes negative positive charge, [imitates vomiting] vomits contents onto
next cell, forth. Sodium rushing cell, therefore, way
action potential stimulated. words, sodium way neurons
communicate one another. Now, neurons don't stay positive charge.
Otherwise, just keep vomiting contents, [imitates vomiting],


need maintain that, need go back preparing next

familiar with, thirst. ever wondered just get
thirsty? Well, neurons OVLT detecting changes
bloodstream, detect global changes within body, response that,
OVLT sets off certain events within brain body make either want
drink fluid stop drinking fluid. two main kinds thirst. first
one called osmotic thirst, second called hypovolemic thirst. Osmotic thirst
concentration salt bloodstream, say ingest
something very, salty. say ingest big bag of, confess don't eat
often, really like kettle potato chips, pretty salty. never
actually measured much sodium them. sure information there. Every
while, particularly interested so, just bag things,
really like them, salty, almost always make feel
thirsty, reason eating those, ingested lot sodium. Again, not
frequent occurrence me, happens every now again, don't
much shame think pretty healthy relationship food
enjoy them, understand will drive salt levels bloodstream,
will cause thirsty, why? Why? neurons OVLT come two
main varieties. One variety senses osmolarity blood getting across
weak little fence talked before, osmolarity, meaning salt
concentration blood, high, activates specific neurons OVLT,
activates, mean causes send electrical potentials, literally, send electrical
signals brain areas, brain areas inspire number different
downstream events, brain areas? Well, OVLT signals
area called supraoptic nucleus. name called supraoptic nucleus
not necessarily important. also signals so-called paraventricular nucleus,
another nucleus sits near ventricles can monitor qualities, chemical
qualities cerebrospinal fluid well as, probably, bloodstream well,
consequence communication particular hormone eventually released
posterior pituitary. Now, pituitary gland sits near roof
mouth. releases sorts things like growth hormone luteinizing hormone.
Luteinizing hormone will stimulate things like estrogen testosterone production
release ovaries testes on. pituitary bunch different
compartments functions, really cool pituitary certain
regions pituitary actually contain axons, wires neurons, neurons


reside brain, supraoptic nucleus gets signal OVLT.
signal purely form electrical activity. Remember, neurons aren't talking one
another happening there. not saying, "Psst! "Hey,
much salt bloodstream. "Let's something it." receive so-
called action potential, waves electricity. neurons supraoptic nucleus
release electrical signals within pituitary, neurons
nearby neurons capable releasing hormones well electrical signals,
pituitary, hormonal signal released called vasopressin. Vasopressin
also goes name antidiuretic hormone, antidiuretic hormone capacity
either restrict amount urine secrete, or, system turned off,
increase amount urine secrete, complicated set
cascades evoked high salt concentration blood. also
complicated set cascades evoked low concentrations sodium
blood, pathway nonetheless same. OVLT detecting
osmolarity changes, communicating supraoptic nucleus. Supraoptic nucleus
either causing release releasing vasopressin, antidiuretic hormone,
system shut off antidiuretic hormone not secreted, allow
urine flow freely, right? Antidiuretic means anti release urine, shutting
off, going cause release urine. sort allowing system
flow, speak. second category thirst hypovolemic thirst.

00:29:27 Blood Pressure & Thirst

Hypovolemic thirst occurs drop blood pressure, okay? OVLT,
mentioned before, can sense osmolarity based fact neurons
can detect much salt bloodstream, OVLT also harbors neurons
baroreceptor, mechanoreceptor category. Now, baroreceptors
mechanoreceptors later, baroreceptors essentially receptor, meaning
protein cell responds changes blood pressure, number
things can cause decreases blood pressure. include,
instance, lose lot blood, right? bleeding quite lot, cases,
vomit quite lot, extensive diarrhea combination those,
things can reduce blood volume, will talk
later, classic case hypovolemic thirst, one simply losing blood,


therefore, blood pressure goes down, simple imagine mind.
pipes, arteries, veins, capillaries, lose
blood volume, pressure arteries, veins, capillaries goes down. OVLT
neurons can sense reduction blood pressure presence
baroreceptors OVLT. elements also play response
call hypovolemic thirst. instance, kidney will secrete something called
renin. Renin will activate something called angiotensin II lungs, things,
amazing, angiotensin II can act OVLT, organum vasculosum lateral
terminalis, which, turn, will create thirst, okay? cases, right? osmolarity
sensing system, meaning osmotic thirst, hypovolemic thirst, blood pressure
dropped, end result desire drink more, desire drink
comes variety pathways direct indirect, include
vasopressin don't include vasopressin, think, just sake general example,
even don't biology background physiology
background, just understand two main types thirst. types thirst,
osmotic thirst hypovolemic thirst, not just seeking water, also
seeking salt. general terms, salt, aka sodium, can help retain water. Now,
doesn't mean salt always retains water. excessive amounts salt,
will retain excessive amounts water? Well, sort of. soon learn,
contextual, cases, can say salt system, brain
body can function normally provided levels salt adequate not
high low, thirst, often think just way bring fluid
body, designed kind interoceptive perception. mean that,
interoception, many know now listening podcast, paying
attention recognition, rather, conscious recognition events going within
body, thirsty, certain form interoception. go, "Oh, need
something crave something." may not know exactly need,
thirsty, not just seeking water; also seeking balance
osmolarity, means may seeking salty fluids foods, cases.
try accomplish eating, may trying avoid, will
inspired avoid salty fluids foods, want understand sodium
roles body, understand thirst, want understand thirst,
understand fluid balance regulated body. not surprising
all, sodium water work together order generate call thirst.



00:33:47 Kidneys & Urine Regulation

Sodium water work together order either retain water inspire us let go water,
urinate, can dive specifics around salt use salt
performance various recommendations things avoid, need drill little
bit deeper fluid balance mechanism body, reason,
pay least little bit attention kidney. kidney incredible organ,
one reasons kidney amazing responsible retaining,
holding onto, allowing release various substances body, substances
like glucose amino acids, urea, uric acid, salt, potassium, magnesium. basically
filter, very, intelligent filter. mean, intelligent meaning doesn't
mind, way works really beautiful. Basically, blood enters kidney
goes series tubes arranged loops. want look
this, beautiful Loop Henle aspects kidney design
allow certain substances retained substances released, depending
concentrated substances blood. kidney responds
number hormonal signals, including vasopressin, order to, instance, antidiuretic
hormone, order hold onto fluid brain body need,
responds hormonal signals well, pretty complex organ. Nonetheless,
key point, already mentioned, think people don't realize.
actually something like tell kids meet them, provided
appropriate age. say, oftentimes, kids learn scientist, ask
question something related science, hopefully, sake, something
neuroscience, one thing tell kids, say, "Do know urine,
pee, "is actually filtered blood?" occasionally, will really terrify kid,
also occasionally really terrifies adult, indeed, urine filtered blood.
Basically, blood gets kidney. kidney's going filter certain things.
Certain things going allowed pass others not, okay?
way kidney designed 90% stuff absorbed blood
going absorbed early series tubes, small percentage
going regulated worked get called distal kidney.
mean, distal just means furthest part away, okay? proximal close, like
shoulder proximal midline body, hand distal,


biological terms, hear proximal, distal, just means near far from,
just give really simple example, say low fluid. haven't
much drink while. Maybe walking around hot day. Chances
neurons OVLT will sense increase osmolarity, right?
concentration salt going increased relative fluid volume
circulating. This, course, assumes haven't excreted lot sodium one
reason another, increase osmolarity detected OVLT. OVLT
going signal bunch different cascades supraoptic nucleus, et cetera,
then, vasopressin going released bloodstream, vasopressin,
again, also called antidiuretic hormone, going act kidney change
kidney's function couple different ways, mechanical, chemical, okay?
order make sure kidney not release much water, doesn't make
want urinate, fact, even try urinate, body's going tend
hold onto fluid stores. simple, straightforward example. can also give
example whereby ingesting lot, lot, lot water, not
particularly hot day, not sweating much, assume salt intake
constant low whatever reason, well, then, osmolarity, salt concentration
blood, going lower. OVLT will detect
osmosensing neurons OVLT. OVLT will fail signal supraoptic
nucleus, will not release vasopressin antidiuretic hormone,
can excrete water body wants excrete, meaning able
urinate. no holding onto water level kidney, okay? simple
examples, hopefully, illustrates events within blood, meaning
concentration salt relative amount fluid, right? osmolarity is,
detected OVLT. brain communicates pituitary. pituitary sends
hormone blood, hormone acts kidney either hold onto
let go fluid, meaning prevent wanting urinate stimulating
want urinate. Very, simple kind yes/no-type situation here. lot
nuance reality. lot hormones pathway, think,
least stage discussion,

00:39:08 Vasopressin: Roles Libido & Urination

sufficient. may noticed molecule


talking lot today, vasopressin, also mentioned previous episode
Huberman Lab Podcast, different context. molecule referring
vasopressin, and, mentioned, hormone involved antidiuresis, meaning
preventing urination. antidiuretic, also talked vasopressin
context desire, love, attachment. talked context monogamy
nonmonogamy species animal called prairie vole. can check
episode. believe vasopressin nonmonogamous prairie voles mentioned
timestamp, easy find. Vasopressin made multiple locations
nervous system, mainly supraoptic nucleus, indeed, also involved aspects
sexual behavior mating. Now, mechanisms distinct
antidiuretic effects. fact, people take vasopressin
aphrodisiac. Now, certainly not suggesting people that,
confidence world moment talk vasopressin, someone
comments going say, "What think vasopressin nasal sprays "and
kind thing?" Vasopressin, indeed oxytocin, another hormone involved
pair bonding various aspects brain body function, available nasal
sprays can get deep recesses brain can impact
core call hypothalamic functions, primitive drives hypothalamic
functions. encourage lot caution, maybe even extreme caution
recreational use things like vasopressin oxytocin unless working MD,
MD, excuse me, prescribe really know doing.
powerful hormones lot different effects brain body.
way vasopressin, meaning antidiuretic hormone, prevents release fluid
urine body pretty interesting. acts directly kidney, so, mentioned
before, blood flows kidney. number things retained early part
kidney. Vasopressin acts fairly distal, meaning kind end game part
loops tubes kidney, increases permeability tubes.
words, makes sure fluid otherwise pass collecting duct
go bladder never actually makes bladder. point
antidiuretic hormone prevents bladder filling all.
not locks fluid bladder prevents urinating. think way
describing things now way hear antidiuretic hormone,
might sound like kind locks bladder prevents able
urinate, full bladder. uncomfortable. not


way works. actually causes tubes headed towards bladder kidney
become permeable, meaning allow fluid go back bloodstream, rest
body, fluid never actually fills bladder, never feel urge
urinate. Now, episode salt. key thing understand kidney
kidney uses sodium order conserve water, everything
fact sodium can actually hold water. Put differently, water tends follow
sodium, sodium, tend water, sodium,
concentrated, can hold onto water, one main ways kidney holds
onto water body, soon learn, no simple direct formula
say, instance, "Okay, salt levels high, lot water retained, "and salt
levels low, lot water released." one hand, can true, also
case systems homeostatic, meaning always seeking
balance, within system, within salt system, systems, salt
water system. also case, often, enough sodium, well, can
secrete sodium water will follow, don't enough sodium, then,
yes, indeed not holding onto water, fluid can excreted,
condition low sodium lasts long enough, start retain water
body recognizes, "Ah, salt low, water excreted," eventually, system
will kick retain water, love give simple black-and-white, yes-or-no
answer low sodium, high sodium, moderate sodium, water balance,
contextual, say contextual, mean, will depend blood pressure,
hypertension, prehypertension, there, maybe normal tension, hormone levels,
exercise, et cetera, et cetera. pretty good example complicated can
one may familiar with. pretty well known certain
phases menstrual cycle, estrogen progesterone hormones
fluctuating, water can retained body. called edema,
swelling, sometimes, common assumption, indeed, can true,
estrogen levels high, water retention body. Also, males, estrogen
levels high, can water retention body. one reasons
athletes and, particular, bodybuilders take anabolic steroids like testosterone,
can converted estrogens, sometimes look, walk around,
look like partially inflated. look like going pop, looks like
swelling skin, not just large muscles, not always,
often, water retention due testosterone conversion estrogen. Now,


sounds consistent, right? Estrogen levels fluctuate menstrual cycle. males,
increase estrogen, retention water, actually, estrogen
acts diuretic, one think, "Okay, estrogen levels go up, "there
lot fluid excreted," bring example point
complicated dynamic balance hormones salt fluid. can't draw
one-to-one relationship there, turns important point,
can use that, not way complicate things, way understand
contexts

00:45:46 Much Salt Need?

less sodium intake sodium intake can beneficial, like
turn attention now, much salt need? can trust terms
trying guide ingestion salt? First all, want very, clear
number people prehypertension hypertension. need
know prehypertension hypertension. need know
normal tension, meaning normal blood pressure. Everyone know blood
pressure. absolutely crucial measurement lot impact
immediate long-term health outcomes. informs lot do.
cardiovascular exercise? ingesting
less salt? adjusting number different lifestyle factors? need
know that, without knowing blood pressure is, can't give one-size-

simply going spell know research, which, hopefully, will point
direction figuring right terms salt indeed fluid intake.
school thought everybody consuming much salt, want
highlight fact dozens, not hundreds, quality papers point
fact a, quote-unquote, high salt diet can bad various organs tissues
body, including brain. just happens fluid balance, inside

consequences brain function. One critical issue many studies, however,
high-salt diet often coupled elements diet also unhealthy,
things like excessively high levels carbohydrates fats combinations
carbohydrates fats, know many burning questions

going talk moment, number people
low blood pressure, right? People get dizzy stand up, people
feeling chronically fatigued, cases, not all, groups can actually

somewhat abnormally low blood pressure, don't think alone fact
many people suffer low blood pressure condition. Many people

before, certain concentration sodium, meaning sufficient sodium
bloodstream, will tend draw water bloodstream, essentially,
pipes capillaries, arteries, veins will full. blood pressure will
get head, whereas people, blood pressure low
osmolarity blood low, can number downstream
consequences. also mention can consequence challenges

then, increased quite, health risks increased quite substantially one moves
past 6 grams sodium, 7 grams sodium per day. things really
seem get hazardous, really, makes sense, think, given consensus around
this, really avoid high salt intake, "The Salt Fix" describes rationale behind

00:29:27 Blood Pressure & Thirst

Hypovolemic thirst occurs drop blood pressure, okay? OVLT,
mentioned before, can sense osmolarity based fact neurons

vasopressin don't include vasopressin, think, just sake general example,
even don't biology background physiology
background, just understand two main types thirst. types thirst,
osmotic thirst hypovolemic thirst, not just seeking water, also
seeking salt. general terms, salt, aka sodium, can help retain water. Now,
doesn't mean salt always retains water. excessive amounts salt,
will retain excessive amounts water? Well, sort of. soon learn,
contextual, cases, can say salt system, brain
body can function normally provided levels salt adequate not
high low, thirst, often think just way bring fluid
body, designed kind interoceptive perception. mean that,
interoception, many know now listening podcast, paying
attention recognition, rather, conscious recognition events going within

something crave something." may not know exactly need,
thirsty, not just seeking water; also seeking balance

roles body, understand thirst, want understand thirst,
understand fluid balance regulated body. not surprising
all, sodium water work together order generate call thirst.



00:33:47 Kidneys & Urine Regulation

Sodium water work together order either retain water inspire us let go water,
urinate, can dive specifics around salt use salt
performance various recommendations things avoid, need drill little
bit deeper fluid balance mechanism body, reason,
pay least little bit attention kidney. kidney incredible organ,
one reasons kidney amazing responsible retaining,
holding onto, allowing release various substances body, substances
like glucose amino acids, urea, uric acid, salt, potassium, magnesium. basically
filter, very, intelligent filter. mean, intelligent meaning doesn't
mind, way works really beautiful. Basically, blood enters kidney
goes series tubes arranged loops. want look
this, beautiful Loop Henle aspects kidney design
allow certain substances retained substances released, depending
concentrated substances blood. kidney responds
number hormonal signals, including vasopressin, order to, instance, antidiuretic
hormone, order hold onto fluid brain body need,
responds hormonal signals well, pretty complex organ. Nonetheless,
key point, already mentioned, think people don't realize.
actually something like tell kids meet them, provided
appropriate age. say, oftentimes, kids learn scientist, ask
question something related science, hopefully, sake, something
neuroscience, one thing tell kids, say, "Do know urine,
pee, "is actually filtered blood?" occasionally, will really terrify kid,
also occasionally really terrifies adult, indeed, urine filtered blood.
Basically, blood gets kidney. kidney's going filter certain things.
Certain things going allowed pass others not, okay?
way kidney designed 90% stuff absorbed blood
going absorbed early series tubes, small percentage
going regulated worked get called distal kidney.
mean, distal just means furthest part away, okay? proximal close, like
shoulder proximal midline body, hand distal,


biological terms, hear proximal, distal, just means near far from,
just give really simple example, say low fluid. haven't
much drink while. Maybe walking around hot day. Chances
neurons OVLT will sense increase osmolarity, right?
concentration salt going increased relative fluid volume
circulating. This, course, assumes haven't excreted lot sodium one
reason another, increase osmolarity detected OVLT. OVLT
going signal bunch different cascades supraoptic nucleus, et cetera,
then, vasopressin going released bloodstream, vasopressin,
again, also called antidiuretic hormone, going act kidney change
kidney's function couple different ways, mechanical, chemical, okay?
order make sure kidney not release much water, doesn't make
want urinate, fact, even try urinate, body's going tend
hold onto fluid stores. simple, straightforward example. can also give
example whereby ingesting lot, lot, lot water, not
particularly hot day, not sweating much, assume salt intake
constant low whatever reason, well, then, osmolarity, salt concentration
blood, going lower. OVLT will detect
osmosensing neurons OVLT. OVLT will fail signal supraoptic
nucleus, will not release vasopressin antidiuretic hormone,
can excrete water body wants excrete, meaning able
urinate. no holding onto water level kidney, okay? simple
examples, hopefully, illustrates events within blood, meaning
concentration salt relative amount fluid, right? osmolarity is,
detected OVLT. brain communicates pituitary. pituitary sends
hormone blood, hormone acts kidney either hold onto
let go fluid, meaning prevent wanting urinate stimulating

talking lot today, vasopressin, also mentioned previous episode
Huberman Lab Podcast, different context. molecule referring

before, blood flows kidney. number things retained early part

antidiuretic hormone prevents bladder filling all.
not locks fluid bladder prevents urinating. think way
describing things now way hear antidiuretic hormone,
might sound like kind locks bladder prevents able
urinate, full bladder. uncomfortable. not


way works. actually causes tubes headed towards bladder kidney
become permeable, meaning allow fluid go back bloodstream, rest
body, fluid never actually fills bladder, never feel urge
urinate. Now, episode salt. key thing understand kidney
kidney uses sodium order conserve water, everything
fact sodium can actually hold water. Put differently, water tends follow
sodium, sodium, tend water, sodium,
concentrated, can hold onto water, one main ways kidney holds
onto water body, soon learn, no simple direct formula
say, instance, "Okay, salt levels high, lot water retained, "and salt
levels low, lot water released." one hand, can true, also
case systems homeostatic, meaning always seeking
balance, within system, within salt system, systems, salt
water system. also case, often, enough sodium, well, can
secrete sodium water will follow, don't enough sodium, then,
yes, indeed not holding onto water, fluid can excreted,
condition low sodium lasts long enough, start retain water
body recognizes, "Ah, salt low, water excreted," eventually, system
will kick retain water, love give simple black-and-white, yes-or-no
answer low sodium, high sodium, moderate sodium, water balance,
contextual, say contextual, mean, will depend blood pressure,
hypertension, prehypertension, there, maybe normal tension, hormone levels,
exercise, et cetera, et cetera. pretty good example complicated can
one may familiar with. pretty well known certain
phases menstrual cycle, estrogen progesterone hormones
fluctuating, water can retained body. called edema,
swelling, sometimes, common assumption, indeed, can true,
estrogen levels high, water retention body. Also, males, estrogen
levels high, can water retention body. one reasons
athletes and, particular, bodybuilders take anabolic steroids like testosterone,
can converted estrogens, sometimes look, walk around,
look like partially inflated. look like going pop, looks like
swelling skin, not just large muscles, not always,
often, water retention due testosterone conversion estrogen. Now,


sounds consistent, right? Estrogen levels fluctuate menstrual cycle. males,
increase estrogen, retention water, actually, estrogen
acts diuretic, one think, "Okay, estrogen levels go up, "there
lot fluid excreted," bring example point
complicated dynamic balance hormones salt fluid. can't draw
one-to-one relationship there, turns important point,
can use that, not way complicate things, way understand
contexts

salty solutions have, really nice studies looked so-
called adrenalectomies. Now, extreme case, typically done animal
models, illustrates role adrenals salt preference. Basically,
glucocorticoid system, meaning release particular hormones
adrenal glands, eliminated adrenalectomy, -ectomy means removal, then,
threshold considered salty really shifts, okay? typically,
adrenals intact, animal human will prefer mildly salty moderately salty
solution given choice, point, salty just feels aversive, just
like taking gulp seawater almost always aversive. can't think instance
not aversive, actually drinking seawater can kill high

adrenals missing, animals humans will tend prefer higher sodium
concentration fluid, will willing tolerate ingesting high concentrations
sodium. Now, crude experiment, not one want do,
promise you, mention illustrates direct relationship

salt, bring fluid bloodstream. increasing blood pressure,
can restore blood lost. Now, many examples where, sodium levels
get low bloodstream, either people ingesting little salt,
ingesting much water therefore excreting much salt, can cause
stress anxiety. really nice data point fact low dietary

Many people not getting enough magnesium. Many people are. Okay,
magnesium. Anytime talking sodium balance, take
consideration potassium way kidney works way
sodium balance regulated, body brain, sodium
potassium working close concert one another. lot different
recommendations ratios there, range widely two-to-one ratio
potassium sodium. heard direction too. heard two-to-one
sodium potassium. recommendations vary. One sponsors podcast,
instance, LMNT, talked episode before, ratio
gram sodium 200 milligrams potassium, 60 milligrams magnesium, there,
opted five-to-one ratio sodium potassium, and, course, many people
opt make hydration electrolyte formulas. put sea salt
water, maybe even ingest potassium tablet. depends context,
important contextual element diet, so, instance, carbohydrates hold water

many people, not eating easier portion control certain parts day,
find beneficial limit calories overall given amount, depending
goals are, not consuming food certain periods day, usually,
periods day, consuming fluids, oftentimes, fluids include

somebody who, instance, eats first meal around noon 1:00
2:00 p.m., fasting early part day, drinking coffee
tea ingesting lot water, going excreting sodium along
water, many people, including myself, find useful, especially
drinking caffeine so-called fasting nonfood intake part time-restricted
feeding, making sure get enough salt, either form something like
LMNT, electrolyte drink, putting sea salt water, certainly,
anytime one ingesting caffeine, replacing lost water increasing one's

01:32:28 General Recommendations Salt Intake

going want replenish fluids electrolytes lost, including
sodium, can imagine starts become pretty dizzying, yet
doesn't dizzying. can provide useful ranges that, people,
will work, talk ranges are, going point
resource explores ranges various contexts nutrition,
exercise, on. resource book authored Dr. James
DiNicolantonio. not medical doctor. scientist, cardiovascular
physiology well, believe, doctor pharmacy, title book "The
Salt Fix." "The Salt Fix" interesting read points to, first all, history
salt society relates health. actually emphasizes major
missteps, maybe even pretty drastic errors, made terms trying
interpret role salt various diseases emphasizes ways
which, perhaps, increasing salt can actually improve health outcomes, think
strikes pretty nice balance commonly known salt
believe known salt, least taken consideration. book
provide certain recommendations, actually reached author. never
met person talked directly, asked outright. said, "How much
salt "do recommend people take average?" gave, course,
appropriate caveats prehypertension, hypertension, et cetera, made
recommendation just share you, want learn
support recommendation, can check book. recommendation
made anywhere 8 12 grams salt day, corresponds 3.2 4.8


grams sodium, going back current recommendations talked
before, 2.3 grams sodium per day, 1 1/2 times double amount
sodium currently recommended circles, then, corresponds
1 1/2 2 teaspoons salt per day arrive 3.2 4.8 grams sodium.
Again, recommendation passed along people,
conditions, barring specific health issues. Now, also interesting pointed
sodium-to-potassium ratio, 4 grams potassium, also mentioned 400
milligrams magnesium, pointed out, generally agree here, many people
deficient magnesium, again, 3.2 4.8 grams sodium, 4 grams
potassium. might think, "Well, gosh, "that's 1 1/2 2 times current
recommendation," can go back study mentioned earlier
episode, 2011 study, describe sort J-shaped curve which,
look occurrence negative health events, fairly low low
sodium intake, lower still slightly higher sodium intake, much line
recommendations made Dr. DiNicolantonio passed along me,
then, increased quite, health risks increased quite substantially one moves
past 6 grams sodium, 7 grams sodium per day. things really
seem get hazardous, really, makes sense, think, given consensus around
this, really avoid high salt intake, "The Salt Fix" describes rationale behind
recommendations. "The Salt Fix" also describes, quite beautiful detail,
relationship salt intake, potassium intake,

01:47:13 Role Sodium Neuronal Function, Action Potentials

salty sweet interact. Now, thus far, already covered quite lot material,

key point, already mentioned, think people don't realize.
actually something like tell kids meet them, provided
appropriate age. say, oftentimes, kids learn scientist, ask
question something related science, hopefully, sake, something
neuroscience, one thing tell kids, say, "Do know urine,
pee, "is actually filtered blood?" occasionally, will really terrify kid,
also occasionally really terrifies adult, indeed, urine filtered blood.
Basically, blood gets kidney. kidney's going filter certain things.
Certain things going allowed pass others not, okay?
way kidney designed 90% stuff absorbed blood
going absorbed early series tubes, small percentage
going regulated worked get called distal kidney.
mean, distal just means furthest part away, okay? proximal close, like

1 1/2 2 teaspoons salt per day arrive 3.2 4.8 grams sodium.
Again, recommendation passed along people,
conditions, barring specific health issues. Now, also interesting pointed
sodium-to-potassium ratio, 4 grams potassium, also mentioned 400
milligrams magnesium, pointed out, generally agree here, many people

look occurrence negative health events, fairly low low
sodium intake, lower still slightly higher sodium intake, much line
recommendations made Dr. DiNicolantonio passed along me,
then, increased quite, health risks increased quite substantially one moves
past 6 grams sodium, 7 grams sodium per day. things really
seem get hazardous, really, makes sense, think, given consensus around
this, really avoid high salt intake, "The Salt Fix" describes rationale behind
recommendations. "The Salt Fix" also describes, quite beautiful detail,
relationship salt intake, potassium intake,

00:33:47 Kidneys & Urine Regulation

Sodium water work together order either retain water inspire us let go water,
urinate, can dive specifics around salt use salt
performance various recommendations things avoid, need drill little
bit deeper fluid balance mechanism body, reason,
pay least little bit attention kidney. kidney incredible organ,
one reasons kidney amazing responsible retaining,
holding onto, allowing release various substances body, substances
like glucose amino acids, urea, uric acid, salt, potassium, magnesium. basically
filter, very, intelligent filter. mean, intelligent meaning doesn't
mind, way works really beautiful. Basically, blood enters kidney
goes series tubes arranged loops. want look
this, beautiful Loop Henle aspects kidney design
allow certain substances retained substances released, depending
concentrated substances blood. kidney responds
number hormonal signals, including vasopressin, order to, instance, antidiuretic
hormone, order hold onto fluid brain body need,
responds hormonal signals well, pretty complex organ. Nonetheless,
key point, already mentioned, think people don't realize.
actually something like tell kids meet them, provided
appropriate age. say, oftentimes, kids learn scientist, ask
question something related science, hopefully, sake, something
neuroscience, one thing tell kids, say, "Do know urine,
pee, "is actually filtered blood?" occasionally, will really terrify kid,
also occasionally really terrifies adult, indeed, urine filtered blood.
Basically, blood gets kidney. kidney's going filter certain things.
Certain things going allowed pass others not, okay?
way kidney designed 90% stuff absorbed blood
going absorbed early series tubes, small percentage
going regulated worked get called distal kidney.
mean, distal just means furthest part away, okay? proximal close, like
shoulder proximal midline body, hand distal,


biological terms, hear proximal, distal, just means near far from,
just give really simple example, say low fluid. haven't
much drink while. Maybe walking around hot day. Chances
neurons OVLT will sense increase osmolarity, right?
concentration salt going increased relative fluid volume
circulating. This, course, assumes haven't excreted lot sodium one
reason another, increase osmolarity detected OVLT. OVLT
going signal bunch different cascades supraoptic nucleus, et cetera,
then, vasopressin going released bloodstream, vasopressin,
again, also called antidiuretic hormone, going act kidney change
kidney's function couple different ways, mechanical, chemical, okay?
order make sure kidney not release much water, doesn't make
want urinate, fact, even try urinate, body's going tend
hold onto fluid stores. simple, straightforward example. can also give
example whereby ingesting lot, lot, lot water, not
particularly hot day, not sweating much, assume salt intake
constant low whatever reason, well, then, osmolarity, salt concentration
blood, going lower. OVLT will detect
osmosensing neurons OVLT. OVLT will fail signal supraoptic
nucleus, will not release vasopressin antidiuretic hormone,
can excrete water body wants excrete, meaning able
urinate. no holding onto water level kidney, okay? simple
examples, hopefully, illustrates events within blood, meaning
concentration salt relative amount fluid, right? osmolarity is,
detected OVLT. brain communicates pituitary. pituitary sends
hormone blood, hormone acts kidney either hold onto
let go fluid, meaning prevent wanting urinate stimulating
want urinate. Very, simple kind yes/no-type situation here. lot
nuance reality. lot hormones pathway, think,
least stage discussion,

00:39:08 Vasopressin: Roles Libido & Urination

sufficient. may noticed molecule


talking lot today, vasopressin, also mentioned previous episode
Huberman Lab Podcast, different context. molecule referring
vasopressin, and, mentioned, hormone involved antidiuresis, meaning
preventing urination. antidiuretic, also talked vasopressin
context desire, love, attachment. talked context monogamy
nonmonogamy species animal called prairie vole. can check
episode. believe vasopressin nonmonogamous prairie voles mentioned
timestamp, easy find. Vasopressin made multiple locations
nervous system, mainly supraoptic nucleus, indeed, also involved aspects
sexual behavior mating. Now, mechanisms distinct
antidiuretic effects. fact, people take vasopressin
aphrodisiac. Now, certainly not suggesting people that,
confidence world moment talk vasopressin, someone
comments going say, "What think vasopressin nasal sprays "and
kind thing?" Vasopressin, indeed oxytocin, another hormone involved
pair bonding various aspects brain body function, available nasal
sprays can get deep recesses brain can impact

MD, excuse me, prescribe really know doing.
powerful hormones lot different effects brain body.
way vasopressin, meaning antidiuretic hormone, prevents release fluid

before, blood flows kidney. number things retained early part
kidney. Vasopressin acts fairly distal, meaning kind end game part
loops tubes kidney, increases permeability tubes.
words, makes sure fluid otherwise pass collecting duct
go bladder never actually makes bladder. point
antidiuretic hormone prevents bladder filling all.
not locks fluid bladder prevents urinating. think way
describing things now way hear antidiuretic hormone,
might sound like kind locks bladder prevents able
urinate, full bladder. uncomfortable. not


way works. actually causes tubes headed towards bladder kidney
become permeable, meaning allow fluid go back bloodstream, rest
body, fluid never actually fills bladder, never feel urge
urinate. Now, episode salt. key thing understand kidney
kidney uses sodium order conserve water, everything
fact sodium can actually hold water. Put differently, water tends follow
sodium, sodium, tend water, sodium,
concentrated, can hold onto water, one main ways kidney holds
onto water body, soon learn, no simple direct formula
say, instance, "Okay, salt levels high, lot water retained, "and salt
levels low, lot water released." one hand, can true, also
case systems homeostatic, meaning always seeking
balance, within system, within salt system, systems, salt
water system. also case, often, enough sodium, well, can
secrete sodium water will follow, don't enough sodium, then,
yes, indeed not holding onto water, fluid can excreted,
condition low sodium lasts long enough, start retain water
body recognizes, "Ah, salt low, water excreted," eventually, system
will kick retain water, love give simple black-and-white, yes-or-no
answer low sodium, high sodium, moderate sodium, water balance,
contextual, say contextual, mean, will depend blood pressure,
hypertension, prehypertension, there, maybe normal tension, hormone levels,
exercise, et cetera, et cetera. pretty good example complicated can
one may familiar with. pretty well known certain
phases menstrual cycle, estrogen progesterone hormones
fluctuating, water can retained body. called edema,
swelling, sometimes, common assumption, indeed, can true,
estrogen levels high, water retention body. Also, males, estrogen
levels high, can water retention body. one reasons
athletes and, particular, bodybuilders take anabolic steroids like testosterone,
can converted estrogens, sometimes look, walk around,
look like partially inflated. look like going pop, looks like
swelling skin, not just large muscles, not always,
often, water retention due testosterone conversion estrogen. Now,


sounds consistent, right? Estrogen levels fluctuate menstrual cycle. males,
increase estrogen, retention water, actually, estrogen
acts diuretic, one think, "Okay, estrogen levels go up, "there
lot fluid excreted," bring example point
complicated dynamic balance hormones salt fluid. can't draw
one-to-one relationship there, turns important point,
can use that, not way complicate things, way understand
contexts

00:45:46 Much Salt Need?

less sodium intake sodium intake can beneficial, like
turn attention now, much salt need? can trust terms
trying guide ingestion salt? First all, want very, clear
number people prehypertension hypertension. need

know that, without knowing blood pressure is, can't give one-size-

simply going spell know research, which, hopefully, will point
direction figuring right terms salt indeed fluid intake.
school thought everybody consuming much salt, want
highlight fact dozens, not hundreds, quality papers point
fact a, quote-unquote, high salt diet can bad various organs tissues
body, including brain. just happens fluid balance, inside

longevity will suffer, will organs tissues body, so, like things
biology, don't want things high low. Now, say vast majority
studies point fact high-salt diet detrimental brain health
function. studies focused aspect salt balance
consequences brain function. One critical issue many studies, however,
high-salt diet often coupled elements diet also unhealthy,
things like excessively high levels carbohydrates fats combinations
carbohydrates fats, know many burning questions

interesting reports indicate amount salt intake can indeed

saying low, right? don't believe want diet truly low
anything except, perhaps, poison, lower-salt diet can reduce number
so-called hazardous events, somewhat shallow U-shaped function
that, yes indeed, high salt intake can detrimental health, terms

kidney uses sodium order conserve water, everything

sodium. Now, crude experiment, not one want do,
promise you, mention illustrates direct relationship
stress system, glucocorticoid system, salt craving system,
actually makes sense. Earlier, talking hypovolemic thirst,
loss blood pressure from, usually due loss blood body,
salt craving order bring blood volume back ingesting
salt, bring fluid bloodstream. increasing blood pressure,
can restore blood lost. Now, many examples where, sodium levels
get low bloodstream, either people ingesting little salt,
ingesting much water therefore excreting much salt, can cause
stress anxiety. really nice data point fact low dietary
sodium can actually exacerbate anxiety animal models, extent,
evidence humans well, not come surprise. whole
basis relationship adrenal system, glucocorticoids, things like
aldosterone, craving sodium stress system generic system

people, however, opt supplement magnesium ways can support them,
many different forms magnesium, just brief passing, just say

forms magnesium, magnesium citrate, functions. Actually,
magnesium citrate fairly effective laxative, not known promote sleep things
sort, lot different forms magnesium, still forms there.
Many people not getting enough magnesium. Many people are. Okay,
magnesium. Anytime talking sodium balance, take
consideration potassium way kidney works way
sodium balance regulated, body brain, sodium
potassium working close concert one another. lot different
recommendations ratios there, range widely two-to-one ratio
potassium sodium. heard direction too. heard two-to-one
sodium potassium. recommendations vary. One sponsors podcast,
instance, LMNT, talked episode before, ratio
gram sodium 200 milligrams potassium, 60 milligrams magnesium, there,
opted five-to-one ratio sodium potassium, and, course, many people
opt make hydration electrolyte formulas. put sea salt
water, maybe even ingest potassium tablet. depends context,
important contextual element diet, so, instance, carbohydrates hold water
body, regardless much salt much fluid ingesting,

01:27:57 Tools: Effects Low-carbohydrate Diets & Caffeine

ingesting carbohydrate drink fluids, water, fluid going
retained body. Now, people following low-carbohydrate diets, one
immediate effects low-carbohydrate diet going excrete
water, so, conditions, also going lose not just water,
probably also lose sodium potassium, people, many people,
fact, find lower low-carbohydrate diet, need make
sure getting enough sodium enough potassium, people
taking 99-milligram potassium tablets every time eat. people
ingesting foods contain potassium, and, course, people
low-carbohydrate diets ingest vegetables forms food carry along
potassium, quite variable person person. mean, can


imagine carbohydrate holds water, water salt balance potassium go hand
hand, hand, low-carbohydrate diet, might need adjust
salt intake potassium, conversely, carbohydrate-rich diet
moderate carbohydrate diet, may need ingest less sodium less
potassium, and, fact, certain amount water probably coming
foods eat well, don't say confuse you. Again, say
depends context. give yet another context think fairly common
nowadays, many people following pattern eating less
resembles intermittent fasting least time-restricted feeding, eating
particular feeding windows, then, certain parts 24-hour cycle,
not just sleep, certain parts waking cycle, also actively avoiding
food, banking on, think, either possible, want say possible, longevity-promoting
effects intermittent fasting, or, and/or, say, banking fact
many people, not eating easier portion control certain parts day,
find beneficial limit calories overall given amount, depending
goals are, not consuming food certain periods day, usually,
periods day, consuming fluids, oftentimes, fluids include
not just water, caffeine, caffeine diuretic. actually causes excretion
fluids body part, causes excretion sodium. say
somebody who, instance, eats first meal around noon 1:00
2:00 p.m., fasting early part day, drinking coffee
tea ingesting lot water, going excreting sodium along
water, many people, including myself, find useful, especially
drinking caffeine so-called fasting nonfood intake part time-restricted
feeding, making sure get enough salt, either form something like
LMNT, electrolyte drink, putting sea salt water, certainly,
anytime one ingesting caffeine, replacing lost water increasing one's
water intake. simple rules thumb around think can get
people place comfortable functioning better,
every ounce coffee tea drink, say caffeinated coffee tea
drink, consume 1 1/2 times much water, say 8-
ounce coffee, try drink about, don't exact, try drink
12-ounce glass water, might want put tiny bit sodium that. tiny
bit, just mean tiny pinch sodium remember, even talking


increasing amount sodium intake overall, total amount sodium contained
salt sufficiently high even just 1/4 teaspoon going really start move
number towards range still within safe range, going to,
keep day long, quickly going get excessive salt
intake range deleterious health, again, consuming caffeine,
going excreting water salt potassium, going
find ways bring water, salt, potassium back in. Again, evaluated
individual situations. exercising fasted,
drinking caffeine, before, during, certainly exercise,

01:32:28 General Recommendations Salt Intake

going want replenish fluids electrolytes lost, including
sodium, can imagine starts become pretty dizzying, yet
doesn't dizzying. can provide useful ranges that, people,
will work, talk ranges are, going point
resource explores ranges various contexts nutrition,
exercise, on. resource book authored Dr. James
DiNicolantonio. not medical doctor. scientist, cardiovascular
physiology well, believe, doctor pharmacy, title book "The
Salt Fix." "The Salt Fix" interesting read points to, first all, history
salt society relates health. actually emphasizes major
missteps, maybe even pretty drastic errors, made terms trying
interpret role salt various diseases emphasizes ways
which, perhaps, increasing salt can actually improve health outcomes, think
strikes pretty nice balance commonly known salt
believe known salt, least taken consideration. book
provide certain recommendations, actually reached author. never
met person talked directly, asked outright. said, "How much
salt "do recommend people take average?" gave, course,
appropriate caveats prehypertension, hypertension, et cetera, made
recommendation just share you, want learn
support recommendation, can check book. recommendation
made anywhere 8 12 grams salt day, corresponds 3.2 4.8


grams sodium, going back current recommendations talked
before, 2.3 grams sodium per day, 1 1/2 times double amount
sodium currently recommended circles, then, corresponds
1 1/2 2 teaspoons salt per day arrive 3.2 4.8 grams sodium.
Again, recommendation passed along people,
conditions, barring specific health issues. Now, also interesting pointed
sodium-to-potassium ratio, 4 grams potassium, also mentioned 400
milligrams magnesium, pointed out, generally agree here, many people
deficient magnesium, again, 3.2 4.8 grams sodium, 4 grams
potassium. might think, "Well, gosh, "that's 1 1/2 2 times current
recommendation," can go back study mentioned earlier
episode, 2011 study, describe sort J-shaped curve which,
look occurrence negative health events, fairly low low
sodium intake, lower still slightly higher sodium intake, much line
recommendations made Dr. DiNicolantonio passed along me,
then, increased quite, health risks increased quite substantially one moves
past 6 grams sodium, 7 grams sodium per day. things really
seem get hazardous, really, makes sense, think, given consensus around
this, really avoid high salt intake, "The Salt Fix" describes rationale behind
recommendations. "The Salt Fix" also describes, quite beautiful detail,
relationship salt intake, potassium intake,

01:36:34 Perception Salt & Sugar Taste, Processed Foods

relationship sugar consumption system. like pick idea

beautiful work done Zuker Lab, Z-U-K-E-R, Zuker Lab Columbia

foods happen ingesting sense perception fluids

describing them, fundamental feature every sensory system, not just
taste system, also visual system. parallel pathways perceiving dark

fundamental feature built nervous system works,
taste system, much like systems, pathways indeed parallel,
converge, can influence one another, think simplest way put
context, first, visual system, whereby ability detect color
red everything fact neurons eye absorb long
wavelengths light call reds, red wavelengths light, longer
wavelengths than, say, blue light, shorter wavelength, really
comparison electrical activity neurons absorb red light activity
neurons absorb green light actually gives perception red,

look something green while, stare it, look away,

salty parallel pathways sweet bitter can actually interact,
important relevance context food choices sugar craving. One
things commonplace nowadays many processed foods business,
literally, business putting so-called hidden sugars, hidden sugars not

01:47:13 Role Sodium Neuronal Function, Action Potentials

salty sweet interact. Now, thus far, already covered quite lot material,
completely remiss didn't emphasize crucial role sodium plays
way neurons function. fact, sodium one key elements allows
neurons function all, way engaging call action
potential. action potential firing electrical activity neurons. Now, neurons
can engage electrical activity number different ways. graded
potentials. gap junctions. whole landscape different
electrophysiologies neurons don't want go just yet, least not
episode, action potential fundamental way neurons communicate
one another. sometimes called spikes. just kind nomenclature
neuroscientists use. just going briefly describe action potential role
sodium plays, will involve little bit chemistry, promise will
accessible anyone, even don't chemistry physics background
electrophysiology background. Neurons inside outside, inside
things like genetic material. bunch things floating around
allow cells function, tend wire extending them,
sometimes long wire, sometimes short one, call axon,


end wire, axon, release little packets chemicals either cause
next neuron fire action potentials prevent next neuron firing action
potentials, kind vomit little packets chemicals either inspire
suppress action potentials neurons. way whole process occurs
given neuron needs change electrical activity, normally, neurons
hanging out, call negative charge, reason
negative charge inside cell things floating around like
potassium, little bit sodium, stuff like chloride. literally just, just
imagine little balls stuff, negative charge them,
inside cell going tend negative, outside cell, turns out,
going bunch stuff positively charged, one main
factors creating positive charge sodium. Sodium carries positive charge,
neurons can just imagine a, sake discussion, can just
imagine sphere little wire sticking it. can put little minus
inside negative. can put little plus outside positive,
neuron stimulated another neuron, stimulation, electrical stimulation
sufficiently high, meaning enough little packets neurotransmitter vomited
onto surface sufficient concentration, happens little pores, little spaces, little
gaps open membrane cell separates inside outside,
positive, lot positive charge outside, lot
negative inside, like boulder running downhill. stuff tends rush downhill.
tries create even amounts charge, negative inside, positive
outside, happens sodium rushes cell carrying lot charge
cell, consequence, charge cell goes negative, actually,
negative, quite positive, hits certain threshold positive charge
sodium ions going cell, fires called action potential,
vomits set chemicals onto next neuron, sets off chain one
neuron goes negative positive, blech, vomits chemicals onto next one.
next one, next neuron, binds receptors enters cell, cell
goes negative positive charge, [imitates vomiting] vomits contents onto
next cell, forth. Sodium rushing cell, therefore, way

communicate one another. Now, neurons don't stay positive charge.
Otherwise, just keep vomiting contents, [imitates vomiting],

basic aspect nervous system function, cases whole
system gets disrupted, brings us topic sodium water balance.
many probably heard,

01:53:13 Dehydration

hopefully, haven't, take message seriously, drink much
water, especially short amount time, can actually kill yourself, right?
certainly don't want happen. ingest lot water short period
time, something called hypernatremia, will excrete lot sodium quickly,
ability regulate kidney function will disrupted, addition that, brain
can actually stop functioning, people actually consumed water excess,
especially sports events forth, water doesn't contain sufficient
electrolytes, can actually shut neurons' ability function disrupting
balance sodium potassium amount extracellular sodium
neurons' ability signal one another action potentials, can't emphasize

now. way can speak. way breathe. literally
control aspects nervous system function. Now, takes quite lot water

talking lot today, vasopressin, also mentioned previous episode
Huberman Lab Podcast, different context. molecule referring
vasopressin, and, mentioned, hormone involved antidiuresis, meaning
preventing urination. antidiuretic, also talked vasopressin
context desire, love, attachment. talked context monogamy
nonmonogamy species animal called prairie vole. can check
episode. believe vasopressin nonmonogamous prairie voles mentioned

before, blood flows kidney. number things retained early part

antidiuretic hormone prevents bladder filling all.
not locks fluid bladder prevents urinating. think way
describing things now way hear antidiuretic hormone,
might sound like kind locks bladder prevents able
urinate, full bladder. uncomfortable. not


way works. actually causes tubes headed towards bladder kidney
become permeable, meaning allow fluid go back bloodstream, rest
body, fluid never actually fills bladder, never feel urge
urinate. Now, episode salt. key thing understand kidney
kidney uses sodium order conserve water, everything
fact sodium can actually hold water. Put differently, water tends follow
sodium, sodium, tend water, sodium,
concentrated, can hold onto water, one main ways kidney holds
onto water body, soon learn, no simple direct formula
say, instance, "Okay, salt levels high, lot water retained, "and salt
levels low, lot water released." one hand, can true, also
case systems homeostatic, meaning always seeking
balance, within system, within salt system, systems, salt
water system. also case, often, enough sodium, well, can
secrete sodium water will follow, don't enough sodium, then,
yes, indeed not holding onto water, fluid can excreted,
condition low sodium lasts long enough, start retain water
body recognizes, "Ah, salt low, water excreted," eventually, system
will kick retain water, love give simple black-and-white, yes-or-no
answer low sodium, high sodium, moderate sodium, water balance,
contextual, say contextual, mean, will depend blood pressure,
hypertension, prehypertension, there, maybe normal tension, hormone levels,
exercise, et cetera, et cetera. pretty good example complicated can
one may familiar with. pretty well known certain
phases menstrual cycle, estrogen progesterone hormones
fluctuating, water can retained body. called edema,
swelling, sometimes, common assumption, indeed, can true,
estrogen levels high, water retention body. Also, males, estrogen
levels high, can water retention body. one reasons
athletes and, particular, bodybuilders take anabolic steroids like testosterone,
can converted estrogens, sometimes look, walk around,
look like partially inflated. look like going pop, looks like
swelling skin, not just large muscles, not always,
often, water retention due testosterone conversion estrogen. Now,


sounds consistent, right? Estrogen levels fluctuate menstrual cycle. males,
increase estrogen, retention water, actually, estrogen
acts diuretic, one think, "Okay, estrogen levels go up, "there
lot fluid excreted," bring example point
complicated dynamic balance hormones salt fluid. can't draw
one-to-one relationship there, turns important point,
can use that, not way complicate things, way understand
contexts

called adrenalectomies. Now, extreme case, typically done animal
models, illustrates role adrenals salt preference. Basically,
glucocorticoid system, meaning release particular hormones
adrenal glands, eliminated adrenalectomy, -ectomy means removal, then,
threshold considered salty really shifts, okay? typically,
adrenals intact, animal human will prefer mildly salty moderately salty
solution given choice, point, salty just feels aversive, just
like taking gulp seawater almost always aversive. can't think instance
not aversive, actually drinking seawater can kill high
osmolarity seawater. certainly don't want drink seawater. conditions
adrenals missing, animals humans will tend prefer higher sodium
concentration fluid, will willing tolerate ingesting high concentrations
sodium. Now, crude experiment, not one want do,
promise you, mention illustrates direct relationship

actually makes sense. Earlier, talking hypovolemic thirst,

get low bloodstream, either people ingesting little salt,
ingesting much water therefore excreting much salt, can cause
stress anxiety. really nice data point fact low dietary

opted five-to-one ratio sodium potassium, and, course, many people
opt make hydration electrolyte formulas. put sea salt

somebody who, instance, eats first meal around noon 1:00
2:00 p.m., fasting early part day, drinking coffee

resource explores ranges various contexts nutrition,

DiNicolantonio. not medical doctor. scientist, cardiovascular
physiology well, believe, doctor pharmacy, title book "The
Salt Fix." "The Salt Fix" interesting read points to, first all, history
salt society relates health. actually emphasizes major
missteps, maybe even pretty drastic errors, made terms trying
interpret role salt various diseases emphasizes ways
which, perhaps, increasing salt can actually improve health outcomes, think
strikes pretty nice balance commonly known salt
believe known salt, least taken consideration. book
provide certain recommendations, actually reached author. never
met person talked directly, asked outright. said, "How much
salt "do recommend people take average?" gave, course,
appropriate caveats prehypertension, hypertension, et cetera, made
recommendation just share you, want learn
support recommendation, can check book. recommendation
made anywhere 8 12 grams salt day, corresponds 3.2 4.8


grams sodium, going back current recommendations talked
before, 2.3 grams sodium per day, 1 1/2 times double amount
sodium currently recommended circles, then, corresponds
1 1/2 2 teaspoons salt per day arrive 3.2 4.8 grams sodium.
Again, recommendation passed along people,
conditions, barring specific health issues. Now, also interesting pointed
sodium-to-potassium ratio, 4 grams potassium, also mentioned 400
milligrams magnesium, pointed out, generally agree here, many people
deficient magnesium, again, 3.2 4.8 grams sodium, 4 grams
potassium. might think, "Well, gosh, "that's 1 1/2 2 times current
recommendation," can go back study mentioned earlier
episode, 2011 study, describe sort J-shaped curve which,
look occurrence negative health events, fairly low low
sodium intake, lower still slightly higher sodium intake, much line
recommendations made Dr. DiNicolantonio passed along me,
then, increased quite, health risks increased quite substantially one moves
past 6 grams sodium, 7 grams sodium per day. things really
seem get hazardous, really, makes sense, think, given consensus around
this, really avoid high salt intake, "The Salt Fix" describes rationale behind
recommendations. "The Salt Fix" also describes, quite beautiful detail,
relationship salt intake, potassium intake,

fluids body part, causes excretion sodium. say
somebody who, instance, eats first meal around noon 1:00
2:00 p.m., fasting early part day, drinking coffee
tea ingesting lot water, going excreting sodium along
water, many people, including myself, find useful, especially
drinking caffeine so-called fasting nonfood intake part time-restricted
feeding, making sure get enough salt, either form something like
LMNT, electrolyte drink, putting sea salt water, certainly,
anytime one ingesting caffeine, replacing lost water increasing one's

DiNicolantonio. not medical doctor. scientist, cardiovascular

Salt Fix." "The Salt Fix" interesting read points to, first all, history
salt society relates health. actually emphasizes major
missteps, maybe even pretty drastic errors, made terms trying
interpret role salt various diseases emphasizes ways
which, perhaps, increasing salt can actually improve health outcomes, think
strikes pretty nice balance commonly known salt
believe known salt, least taken consideration. book
provide certain recommendations, actually reached author. never
met person talked directly, asked outright. said, "How much
salt "do recommend people take average?" gave, course,
appropriate caveats prehypertension, hypertension, et cetera, made
recommendation just share you, want learn
support recommendation, can check book. recommendation
made anywhere 8 12 grams salt day, corresponds 3.2 4.8


grams sodium, going back current recommendations talked
before, 2.3 grams sodium per day, 1 1/2 times double amount
sodium currently recommended circles, then, corresponds
1 1/2 2 teaspoons salt per day arrive 3.2 4.8 grams sodium.
Again, recommendation passed along people,
conditions, barring specific health issues. Now, also interesting pointed
sodium-to-potassium ratio, 4 grams potassium, also mentioned 400
milligrams magnesium, pointed out, generally agree here, many people
deficient magnesium, again, 3.2 4.8 grams sodium, 4 grams
potassium. might think, "Well, gosh, "that's 1 1/2 2 times current
recommendation," can go back study mentioned earlier
episode, 2011 study, describe sort J-shaped curve which,
look occurrence negative health events, fairly low low
sodium intake, lower still slightly higher sodium intake, much line
recommendations made Dr. DiNicolantonio passed along me,
then, increased quite, health risks increased quite substantially one moves
past 6 grams sodium, 7 grams sodium per day. things really
seem get hazardous, really, makes sense, think, given consensus around
this, really avoid high salt intake, "The Salt Fix" describes rationale behind
recommendations. "The Salt Fix" also describes, quite beautiful detail,
relationship salt intake, potassium intake,

salty solutions have, really nice studies looked so-
called adrenalectomies. Now, extreme case, typically done animal

glucocorticoid system, meaning release particular hormones
adrenal glands, eliminated adrenalectomy, -ectomy means removal, then,
threshold considered salty really shifts, okay? typically,
adrenals intact, animal human will prefer mildly salty moderately salty
solution given choice, point, salty just feels aversive, just
like taking gulp seawater almost always aversive. can't think instance
not aversive, actually drinking seawater can kill high

will work, talk ranges are, going point
resource explores ranges various contexts nutrition,

DiNicolantonio. not medical doctor. scientist, cardiovascular
physiology well, believe, doctor pharmacy, title book "The
Salt Fix." "The Salt Fix" interesting read points to, first all, history
salt society relates health. actually emphasizes major
missteps, maybe even pretty drastic errors, made terms trying
interpret role salt various diseases emphasizes ways
which, perhaps, increasing salt can actually improve health outcomes, think
strikes pretty nice balance commonly known salt
believe known salt, least taken consideration. book
provide certain recommendations, actually reached author. never
met person talked directly, asked outright. said, "How much
salt "do recommend people take average?" gave, course,
appropriate caveats prehypertension, hypertension, et cetera, made
recommendation just share you, want learn
support recommendation, can check book. recommendation
made anywhere 8 12 grams salt day, corresponds 3.2 4.8


grams sodium, going back current recommendations talked
before, 2.3 grams sodium per day, 1 1/2 times double amount
sodium currently recommended circles, then, corresponds
1 1/2 2 teaspoons salt per day arrive 3.2 4.8 grams sodium.
Again, recommendation passed along people,
conditions, barring specific health issues. Now, also interesting pointed
sodium-to-potassium ratio, 4 grams potassium, also mentioned 400
milligrams magnesium, pointed out, generally agree here, many people
deficient magnesium, again, 3.2 4.8 grams sodium, 4 grams
potassium. might think, "Well, gosh, "that's 1 1/2 2 times current
recommendation," can go back study mentioned earlier
episode, 2011 study, describe sort J-shaped curve which,
look occurrence negative health events, fairly low low
sodium intake, lower still slightly higher sodium intake, much line
recommendations made Dr. DiNicolantonio passed along me,
then, increased quite, health risks increased quite substantially one moves
past 6 grams sodium, 7 grams sodium per day. things really
seem get hazardous, really, makes sense, think, given consensus around
this, really avoid high salt intake, "The Salt Fix" describes rationale behind
recommendations. "The Salt Fix" also describes, quite beautiful detail,
relationship salt intake, potassium intake,

called adrenalectomies. Now, extreme case, typically done animal

glucocorticoid system, meaning release particular hormones

threshold considered salty really shifts, okay? typically,
adrenals intact, animal human will prefer mildly salty moderately salty

which, perhaps, increasing salt can actually improve health outcomes, think
strikes pretty nice balance commonly known salt

past 6 grams sodium, 7 grams sodium per day. things really
seem get hazardous, really, makes sense, think, given consensus around
this, really avoid high salt intake, "The Salt Fix" describes rationale behind
recommendations. "The Salt Fix" also describes, quite beautiful detail,

foods happen ingesting sense perception fluids
components fluids happen ingesting. Now, parallel pathways,
describing them, fundamental feature every sensory system, not just
taste system, also visual system. parallel pathways perceiving dark

fundamental feature built nervous system works,
taste system, much like systems, pathways indeed parallel,
converge, can influence one another, think simplest way put
context, first, visual system, whereby ability detect color

neurons absorb green light actually gives perception red,
might seem little counterintuitive, indeed, not. actually
something red less greenness perceive red green,


actually way entire nervous system works aren't really

threshold considered salty really shifts, okay? typically,
adrenals intact, animal human will prefer mildly salty moderately salty

past 6 grams sodium, 7 grams sodium per day. things really

this, really avoid high salt intake, "The Salt Fix" describes rationale behind
recommendations. "The Salt Fix" also describes, quite beautiful detail,

Again, recommendation passed along people,
conditions, barring specific health issues. Now, also interesting pointed
sodium-to-potassium ratio, 4 grams potassium, also mentioned 400

recommendations made Dr. DiNicolantonio passed along me,
then, increased quite, health risks increased quite substantially one moves
past 6 grams sodium, 7 grams sodium per day. things really
seem get hazardous, really, makes sense, think, given consensus around
this, really avoid high salt intake, "The Salt Fix" describes rationale behind
recommendations. "The Salt Fix" also describes, quite beautiful detail,

sodium currently recommended circles, then, corresponds
1 1/2 2 teaspoons salt per day arrive 3.2 4.8 grams sodium.
Again, recommendation passed along people,
conditions, barring specific health issues. Now, also interesting pointed
sodium-to-potassium ratio, 4 grams potassium, also mentioned 400
milligrams magnesium, pointed out, generally agree here, many people
deficient magnesium, again, 3.2 4.8 grams sodium, 4 grams
potassium. might think, "Well, gosh, "that's 1 1/2 2 times current
recommendation," can go back study mentioned earlier

recommendations made Dr. DiNicolantonio passed along me,
then, increased quite, health risks increased quite substantially one moves
past 6 grams sodium, 7 grams sodium per day. things really
seem get hazardous, really, makes sense, think, given consensus around
this, really avoid high salt intake, "The Salt Fix" describes rationale behind
recommendations. "The Salt Fix" also describes, quite beautiful detail,
relationship salt intake, potassium intake,

opted five-to-one ratio sodium potassium, and, course, many people
opt make hydration electrolyte formulas. put sea salt

will work, talk ranges are, going point
resource explores ranges various contexts nutrition,

DiNicolantonio. not medical doctor. scientist, cardiovascular
physiology well, believe, doctor pharmacy, title book "The
Salt Fix." "The Salt Fix" interesting read points to, first all, history
salt society relates health. actually emphasizes major
missteps, maybe even pretty drastic errors, made terms trying
interpret role salt various diseases emphasizes ways
which, perhaps, increasing salt can actually improve health outcomes, think
strikes pretty nice balance commonly known salt
believe known salt, least taken consideration. book
provide certain recommendations, actually reached author. never
met person talked directly, asked outright. said, "How much
salt "do recommend people take average?" gave, course,
appropriate caveats prehypertension, hypertension, et cetera, made
recommendation just share you, want learn
support recommendation, can check book. recommendation
made anywhere 8 12 grams salt day, corresponds 3.2 4.8


grams sodium, going back current recommendations talked
before, 2.3 grams sodium per day, 1 1/2 times double amount
sodium currently recommended circles, then, corresponds
1 1/2 2 teaspoons salt per day arrive 3.2 4.8 grams sodium.
Again, recommendation passed along people,
conditions, barring specific health issues. Now, also interesting pointed
sodium-to-potassium ratio, 4 grams potassium, also mentioned 400
milligrams magnesium, pointed out, generally agree here, many people
deficient magnesium, again, 3.2 4.8 grams sodium, 4 grams
potassium. might think, "Well, gosh, "that's 1 1/2 2 times current
recommendation," can go back study mentioned earlier
episode, 2011 study, describe sort J-shaped curve which,
look occurrence negative health events, fairly low low
sodium intake, lower still slightly higher sodium intake, much line
recommendations made Dr. DiNicolantonio passed along me,
then, increased quite, health risks increased quite substantially one moves
past 6 grams sodium, 7 grams sodium per day. things really
seem get hazardous, really, makes sense, think, given consensus around
this, really avoid high salt intake, "The Salt Fix" describes rationale behind
recommendations. "The Salt Fix" also describes, quite beautiful detail,
relationship salt intake, potassium intake,

Many people not getting enough magnesium. Many people are. Okay,
magnesium. Anytime talking sodium balance, take
consideration potassium way kidney works way
sodium balance regulated, body brain, sodium
potassium working close concert one another. lot different
recommendations ratios there, range widely two-to-one ratio
potassium sodium. heard direction too. heard two-to-one
sodium potassium. recommendations vary. One sponsors podcast,
instance, LMNT, talked episode before, ratio
gram sodium 200 milligrams potassium, 60 milligrams magnesium, there,
opted five-to-one ratio sodium potassium, and, course, many people
opt make hydration electrolyte formulas. put sea salt
water, maybe even ingest potassium tablet. depends context,
important contextual element diet, so, instance, carbohydrates hold water
body, regardless much salt much fluid ingesting,

01:27:57 Tools: Effects Low-carbohydrate Diets & Caffeine

probably also lose sodium potassium, people, many people,
fact, find lower low-carbohydrate diet, need make

salt intake potassium, conversely, carbohydrate-rich diet
moderate carbohydrate diet, may need ingest less sodium less
potassium, and, fact, certain amount water probably coming
foods eat well, don't say confuse you. Again, say
depends context. give yet another context think fairly common
nowadays, many people following pattern eating less
resembles intermittent fasting least time-restricted feeding, eating
particular feeding windows, then, certain parts 24-hour cycle,
not just sleep, certain parts waking cycle, also actively avoiding
food, banking on, think, either possible, want say possible, longevity-promoting
effects intermittent fasting, or, and/or, say, banking fact
many people, not eating easier portion control certain parts day,
find beneficial limit calories overall given amount, depending
goals are, not consuming food certain periods day, usually,
periods day, consuming fluids, oftentimes, fluids include
not just water, caffeine, caffeine diuretic. actually causes excretion
fluids body part, causes excretion sodium. say
somebody who, instance, eats first meal around noon 1:00
2:00 p.m., fasting early part day, drinking coffee
tea ingesting lot water, going excreting sodium along
water, many people, including myself, find useful, especially
drinking caffeine so-called fasting nonfood intake part time-restricted
feeding, making sure get enough salt, either form something like
LMNT, electrolyte drink, putting sea salt water, certainly,
anytime one ingesting caffeine, replacing lost water increasing one's
water intake. simple rules thumb around think can get
people place comfortable functioning better,
every ounce coffee tea drink, say caffeinated coffee tea
drink, consume 1 1/2 times much water, say 8-
ounce coffee, try drink about, don't exact, try drink
12-ounce glass water, might want put tiny bit sodium that. tiny
bit, just mean tiny pinch sodium remember, even talking


increasing amount sodium intake overall, total amount sodium contained
salt sufficiently high even just 1/4 teaspoon going really start move
number towards range still within safe range, going to,
keep day long, quickly going get excessive salt

going excreting water salt potassium, going
find ways bring water, salt, potassium back in. Again, evaluated
individual situations. exercising fasted,
drinking caffeine, before, during, certainly exercise,

01:32:28 General Recommendations Salt Intake

going want replenish fluids electrolytes lost, including
sodium, can imagine starts become pretty dizzying, yet
doesn't dizzying. can provide useful ranges that, people,
will work, talk ranges are, going point
resource explores ranges various contexts nutrition,

DiNicolantonio. not medical doctor. scientist, cardiovascular
physiology well, believe, doctor pharmacy, title book "The
Salt Fix." "The Salt Fix" interesting read points to, first all, history
salt society relates health. actually emphasizes major
missteps, maybe even pretty drastic errors, made terms trying
interpret role salt various diseases emphasizes ways
which, perhaps, increasing salt can actually improve health outcomes, think
strikes pretty nice balance commonly known salt
believe known salt, least taken consideration. book
provide certain recommendations, actually reached author. never
met person talked directly, asked outright. said, "How much
salt "do recommend people take average?" gave, course,
appropriate caveats prehypertension, hypertension, et cetera, made
recommendation just share you, want learn
support recommendation, can check book. recommendation
made anywhere 8 12 grams salt day, corresponds 3.2 4.8


grams sodium, going back current recommendations talked
before, 2.3 grams sodium per day, 1 1/2 times double amount
sodium currently recommended circles, then, corresponds
1 1/2 2 teaspoons salt per day arrive 3.2 4.8 grams sodium.
Again, recommendation passed along people,
conditions, barring specific health issues. Now, also interesting pointed
sodium-to-potassium ratio, 4 grams potassium, also mentioned 400
milligrams magnesium, pointed out, generally agree here, many people
deficient magnesium, again, 3.2 4.8 grams sodium, 4 grams
potassium. might think, "Well, gosh, "that's 1 1/2 2 times current
recommendation," can go back study mentioned earlier
episode, 2011 study, describe sort J-shaped curve which,
look occurrence negative health events, fairly low low
sodium intake, lower still slightly higher sodium intake, much line
recommendations made Dr. DiNicolantonio passed along me,
then, increased quite, health risks increased quite substantially one moves
past 6 grams sodium, 7 grams sodium per day. things really
seem get hazardous, really, makes sense, think, given consensus around
this, really avoid high salt intake, "The Salt Fix" describes rationale behind
recommendations. "The Salt Fix" also describes, quite beautiful detail,
relationship salt intake, potassium intake,

instance, LMNT, talked episode before, ratio

opted five-to-one ratio sodium potassium, and, course, many people
opt make hydration electrolyte formulas. put sea salt

probably also lose sodium potassium, people, many people,
fact, find lower low-carbohydrate diet, need make
sure getting enough sodium enough potassium, people
taking 99-milligram potassium tablets every time eat. people
ingesting foods contain potassium, and, course, people

salt intake potassium, conversely, carbohydrate-rich diet
moderate carbohydrate diet, may need ingest less sodium less
potassium, and, fact, certain amount water probably coming
foods eat well, don't say confuse you. Again, say
depends context. give yet another context think fairly common
nowadays, many people following pattern eating less
resembles intermittent fasting least time-restricted feeding, eating
particular feeding windows, then, certain parts 24-hour cycle,
not just sleep, certain parts waking cycle, also actively avoiding

effects intermittent fasting, or, and/or, say, banking fact
many people, not eating easier portion control certain parts day,
find beneficial limit calories overall given amount, depending
goals are, not consuming food certain periods day, usually,
periods day, consuming fluids, oftentimes, fluids include
not just water, caffeine, caffeine diuretic. actually causes excretion
fluids body part, causes excretion sodium. say
somebody who, instance, eats first meal around noon 1:00
2:00 p.m., fasting early part day, drinking coffee
tea ingesting lot water, going excreting sodium along
water, many people, including myself, find useful, especially
drinking caffeine so-called fasting nonfood intake part time-restricted
feeding, making sure get enough salt, either form something like
LMNT, electrolyte drink, putting sea salt water, certainly,
anytime one ingesting caffeine, replacing lost water increasing one's
water intake. simple rules thumb around think can get
people place comfortable functioning better,
every ounce coffee tea drink, say caffeinated coffee tea
drink, consume 1 1/2 times much water, say 8-
ounce coffee, try drink about, don't exact, try drink
12-ounce glass water, might want put tiny bit sodium that. tiny
bit, just mean tiny pinch sodium remember, even talking


increasing amount sodium intake overall, total amount sodium contained
salt sufficiently high even just 1/4 teaspoon going really start move
number towards range still within safe range, going to,
keep day long, quickly going get excessive salt

going excreting water salt potassium, going
find ways bring water, salt, potassium back in. Again, evaluated

will work, talk ranges are, going point
resource explores ranges various contexts nutrition,

DiNicolantonio. not medical doctor. scientist, cardiovascular

Salt Fix." "The Salt Fix" interesting read points to, first all, history
salt society relates health. actually emphasizes major
missteps, maybe even pretty drastic errors, made terms trying
interpret role salt various diseases emphasizes ways
which, perhaps, increasing salt can actually improve health outcomes, think
strikes pretty nice balance commonly known salt
believe known salt, least taken consideration. book
provide certain recommendations, actually reached author. never
met person talked directly, asked outright. said, "How much
salt "do recommend people take average?" gave, course,
appropriate caveats prehypertension, hypertension, et cetera, made
recommendation just share you, want learn
support recommendation, can check book. recommendation
made anywhere 8 12 grams salt day, corresponds 3.2 4.8


grams sodium, going back current recommendations talked
before, 2.3 grams sodium per day, 1 1/2 times double amount
sodium currently recommended circles, then, corresponds
1 1/2 2 teaspoons salt per day arrive 3.2 4.8 grams sodium.
Again, recommendation passed along people,
conditions, barring specific health issues. Now, also interesting pointed
sodium-to-potassium ratio, 4 grams potassium, also mentioned 400
milligrams magnesium, pointed out, generally agree here, many people
deficient magnesium, again, 3.2 4.8 grams sodium, 4 grams
potassium. might think, "Well, gosh, "that's 1 1/2 2 times current
recommendation," can go back study mentioned earlier
episode, 2011 study, describe sort J-shaped curve which,
look occurrence negative health events, fairly low low
sodium intake, lower still slightly higher sodium intake, much line
recommendations made Dr. DiNicolantonio passed along me,
then, increased quite, health risks increased quite substantially one moves
past 6 grams sodium, 7 grams sodium per day. things really
seem get hazardous, really, makes sense, think, given consensus around
this, really avoid high salt intake, "The Salt Fix" describes rationale behind
recommendations. "The Salt Fix" also describes, quite beautiful detail,
relationship salt intake, potassium intake,

salty solutions have, really nice studies looked so-
called adrenalectomies. Now, extreme case, typically done animal
models, illustrates role adrenals salt preference. Basically,
glucocorticoid system, meaning release particular hormones
adrenal glands, eliminated adrenalectomy, -ectomy means removal, then,
threshold considered salty really shifts, okay? typically,
adrenals intact, animal human will prefer mildly salty moderately salty
solution given choice, point, salty just feels aversive, just
like taking gulp seawater almost always aversive. can't think instance
not aversive, actually drinking seawater can kill high
osmolarity seawater. certainly don't want drink seawater. conditions
adrenals missing, animals humans will tend prefer higher sodium
concentration fluid, will willing tolerate ingesting high concentrations
sodium. Now, crude experiment, not one want do,

get low bloodstream, either people ingesting little salt,
ingesting much water therefore excreting much salt, can cause

01:47:13 Role Sodium Neuronal Function, Action Potentials

salty sweet interact. Now, thus far, already covered quite lot material,
completely remiss didn't emphasize crucial role sodium plays
way neurons function. fact, sodium one key elements allows
neurons function all, way engaging call action
potential. action potential firing electrical activity neurons. Now, neurons
can engage electrical activity number different ways. graded
potentials. gap junctions. whole landscape different
electrophysiologies neurons don't want go just yet, least not
episode, action potential fundamental way neurons communicate
one another. sometimes called spikes. just kind nomenclature
neuroscientists use. just going briefly describe action potential role
sodium plays, will involve little bit chemistry, promise will
accessible anyone, even don't chemistry physics background
electrophysiology background. Neurons inside outside, inside
things like genetic material. bunch things floating around
allow cells function, tend wire extending them,
sometimes long wire, sometimes short one, call axon,


end wire, axon, release little packets chemicals either cause
next neuron fire action potentials prevent next neuron firing action
potentials, kind vomit little packets chemicals either inspire
suppress action potentials neurons. way whole process occurs
given neuron needs change electrical activity, normally, neurons
hanging out, call negative charge, reason
negative charge inside cell things floating around like
potassium, little bit sodium, stuff like chloride. literally just, just
imagine little balls stuff, negative charge them,
inside cell going tend negative, outside cell, turns out,
going bunch stuff positively charged, one main
factors creating positive charge sodium. Sodium carries positive charge,
neurons can just imagine a, sake discussion, can just
imagine sphere little wire sticking it. can put little minus
inside negative. can put little plus outside positive,
neuron stimulated another neuron, stimulation, electrical stimulation
sufficiently high, meaning enough little packets neurotransmitter vomited
onto surface sufficient concentration, happens little pores, little spaces, little
gaps open membrane cell separates inside outside,
positive, lot positive charge outside, lot
negative inside, like boulder running downhill. stuff tends rush downhill.
tries create even amounts charge, negative inside, positive
outside, happens sodium rushes cell carrying lot charge
cell, consequence, charge cell goes negative, actually,
negative, quite positive, hits certain threshold positive charge
sodium ions going cell, fires called action potential,
vomits set chemicals onto next neuron, sets off chain one
neuron goes negative positive, blech, vomits chemicals onto next one.
next one, next neuron, binds receptors enters cell, cell
goes negative positive charge, [imitates vomiting] vomits contents onto

communicate one another. Now, neurons don't stay positive charge.
Otherwise, just keep vomiting contents, [imitates vomiting],

certainly don't want happen. ingest lot water short period
time, something called hypernatremia, will excrete lot sodium quickly,
ability regulate kidney function will disrupted, addition that, brain

many people, not eating easier portion control certain parts day,
find beneficial limit calories overall given amount, depending
goals are, not consuming food certain periods day, usually,
periods day, consuming fluids, oftentimes, fluids include
not just water, caffeine, caffeine diuretic. actually causes excretion
fluids body part, causes excretion sodium. say
somebody who, instance, eats first meal around noon 1:00
2:00 p.m., fasting early part day, drinking coffee
tea ingesting lot water, going excreting sodium along
water, many people, including myself, find useful, especially
drinking caffeine so-called fasting nonfood intake part time-restricted
feeding, making sure get enough salt, either form something like
LMNT, electrolyte drink, putting sea salt water, certainly,
anytime one ingesting caffeine, replacing lost water increasing one's
water intake. simple rules thumb around think can get
people place comfortable functioning better,
every ounce coffee tea drink, say caffeinated coffee tea
drink, consume 1 1/2 times much water, say 8-
ounce coffee, try drink about, don't exact, try drink
12-ounce glass water, might want put tiny bit sodium that. tiny
bit, just mean tiny pinch sodium remember, even talking


increasing amount sodium intake overall, total amount sodium contained
salt sufficiently high even just 1/4 teaspoon going really start move
number towards range still within safe range, going to,
keep day long, quickly going get excessive salt

going excreting water salt potassium, going
find ways bring water, salt, potassium back in. Again, evaluated

different contexts. want emphasize many people probably getting
enough magnesium diet don't need supplement magnesium.
people, however, opt supplement magnesium ways can support them,
many different forms magnesium, just brief passing, just say

threonate, T-H-R-E-N-O-A-T-E, magnesium threonate, sake promoting
transition sleep depth sleep perhaps, again, highlighted perhaps,
'cause right now mainly animal studies ongoing human studies, data
aren't in. Perhaps magnesium threonate can used way support cognitive

threonate terms promoting transition depth sleep on.
forms magnesium, magnesium citrate, functions. Actually,
magnesium citrate fairly effective laxative, not known promote sleep things
sort, lot different forms magnesium, still forms there.
Many people not getting enough magnesium. Many people are. Okay,
magnesium. Anytime talking sodium balance, take
consideration potassium way kidney works way
sodium balance regulated, body brain, sodium
potassium working close concert one another. lot different
recommendations ratios there, range widely two-to-one ratio
potassium sodium. heard direction too. heard two-to-one
sodium potassium. recommendations vary. One sponsors podcast,
instance, LMNT, talked episode before, ratio
gram sodium 200 milligrams potassium, 60 milligrams magnesium, there,
opted five-to-one ratio sodium potassium, and, course, many people
opt make hydration electrolyte formulas. put sea salt
water, maybe even ingest potassium tablet. depends context,
important contextual element diet, so, instance, carbohydrates hold water
body, regardless much salt much fluid ingesting,

01:27:57 Tools: Effects Low-carbohydrate Diets & Caffeine

ingesting carbohydrate drink fluids, water, fluid going
retained body. Now, people following low-carbohydrate diets, one
immediate effects low-carbohydrate diet going excrete
water, so, conditions, also going lose not just water,
probably also lose sodium potassium, people, many people,
fact, find lower low-carbohydrate diet, need make
sure getting enough sodium enough potassium, people
taking 99-milligram potassium tablets every time eat. people
ingesting foods contain potassium, and, course, people
low-carbohydrate diets ingest vegetables forms food carry along
potassium, quite variable person person. mean, can


imagine carbohydrate holds water, water salt balance potassium go hand
hand, hand, low-carbohydrate diet, might need adjust
salt intake potassium, conversely, carbohydrate-rich diet
moderate carbohydrate diet, may need ingest less sodium less
potassium, and, fact, certain amount water probably coming
foods eat well, don't say confuse you. Again, say
depends context. give yet another context think fairly common
nowadays, many people following pattern eating less
resembles intermittent fasting least time-restricted feeding, eating
particular feeding windows, then, certain parts 24-hour cycle,
not just sleep, certain parts waking cycle, also actively avoiding
food, banking on, think, either possible, want say possible, longevity-promoting
effects intermittent fasting, or, and/or, say, banking fact
many people, not eating easier portion control certain parts day,
find beneficial limit calories overall given amount, depending
goals are, not consuming food certain periods day, usually,
periods day, consuming fluids, oftentimes, fluids include
not just water, caffeine, caffeine diuretic. actually causes excretion
fluids body part, causes excretion sodium. say
somebody who, instance, eats first meal around noon 1:00
2:00 p.m., fasting early part day, drinking coffee
tea ingesting lot water, going excreting sodium along
water, many people, including myself, find useful, especially
drinking caffeine so-called fasting nonfood intake part time-restricted
feeding, making sure get enough salt, either form something like
LMNT, electrolyte drink, putting sea salt water, certainly,
anytime one ingesting caffeine, replacing lost water increasing one's
water intake. simple rules thumb around think can get
people place comfortable functioning better,
every ounce coffee tea drink, say caffeinated coffee tea
drink, consume 1 1/2 times much water, say 8-
ounce coffee, try drink about, don't exact, try drink
12-ounce glass water, might want put tiny bit sodium that. tiny
bit, just mean tiny pinch sodium remember, even talking


increasing amount sodium intake overall, total amount sodium contained
salt sufficiently high even just 1/4 teaspoon going really start move
number towards range still within safe range, going to,
keep day long, quickly going get excessive salt
intake range deleterious health, again, consuming caffeine,
going excreting water salt potassium, going
find ways bring water, salt, potassium back in. Again, evaluated
individual situations. exercising fasted,
drinking caffeine, before, during, certainly exercise,

01:32:28 General Recommendations Salt Intake

going want replenish fluids electrolytes lost, including
sodium, can imagine starts become pretty dizzying, yet
doesn't dizzying. can provide useful ranges that, people,
will work, talk ranges are, going point
resource explores ranges various contexts nutrition,
exercise, on. resource book authored Dr. James
DiNicolantonio. not medical doctor. scientist, cardiovascular
physiology well, believe, doctor pharmacy, title book "The
Salt Fix." "The Salt Fix" interesting read points to, first all, history
salt society relates health. actually emphasizes major
missteps, maybe even pretty drastic errors, made terms trying
interpret role salt various diseases emphasizes ways
which, perhaps, increasing salt can actually improve health outcomes, think
strikes pretty nice balance commonly known salt
believe known salt, least taken consideration. book
provide certain recommendations, actually reached author. never
met person talked directly, asked outright. said, "How much
salt "do recommend people take average?" gave, course,
appropriate caveats prehypertension, hypertension, et cetera, made
recommendation just share you, want learn
support recommendation, can check book. recommendation
made anywhere 8 12 grams salt day, corresponds 3.2 4.8


grams sodium, going back current recommendations talked
before, 2.3 grams sodium per day, 1 1/2 times double amount
sodium currently recommended circles, then, corresponds
1 1/2 2 teaspoons salt per day arrive 3.2 4.8 grams sodium.
Again, recommendation passed along people,
conditions, barring specific health issues. Now, also interesting pointed
sodium-to-potassium ratio, 4 grams potassium, also mentioned 400
milligrams magnesium, pointed out, generally agree here, many people
deficient magnesium, again, 3.2 4.8 grams sodium, 4 grams
potassium. might think, "Well, gosh, "that's 1 1/2 2 times current
recommendation," can go back study mentioned earlier
episode, 2011 study, describe sort J-shaped curve which,
look occurrence negative health events, fairly low low
sodium intake, lower still slightly higher sodium intake, much line
recommendations made Dr. DiNicolantonio passed along me,
then, increased quite, health risks increased quite substantially one moves
past 6 grams sodium, 7 grams sodium per day. things really
seem get hazardous, really, makes sense, think, given consensus around
this, really avoid high salt intake, "The Salt Fix" describes rationale behind
recommendations. "The Salt Fix" also describes, quite beautiful detail,
relationship salt intake, potassium intake,

01:36:34 Perception Salt & Sugar Taste, Processed Foods

relationship sugar consumption system. like pick idea
relationship salt sugar think one key aspect way
salt can work can benefit us can harm us way sodium
sugar regulated actually perceived brain how, conditions
certain levels sodium intake, might inspired seek sugar crave
sweets less, now, talking salt substance
way regulate fluid balance blood volume on. haven't talked lot
salt taste taste things salty, yet know salt
receptors, meaning neurons, fire action potentials salty substances
detected, much way sweet detectors bitter detectors,


detectors umami, savory flavor, tongue, earlier,
beginning episode, talked fact sweet receptors, neurons
respond presence sugar even noncaloric sweet things gut,
signals brain vagus nerve, signals converge
pathways relate dopamine on. Well, also salt sensors various
locations throughout digestive tract, although sensation taste salt
actually exerts robust effect certain areas brain can either make us
crave sate, meaning fulfill, desire salt, can imagine
important. brain actually register whether not bringing
salt order know whether not going crave salt not,
beautiful work done Zuker Lab, Z-U-K-E-R, Zuker Lab Columbia
University, well many labs used imaging techniques
techniques molecular biology define so-called parallel pathways,
parallel meaning pathways represent sweet presence sweet taste
mouth gut, parallel pathways, meaning neural circuits represent presence
salty tastes mouth gut on, go brain, move
brain stem centers neocortex indeed seed
conscious perception give us sense perception components
foods happen ingesting sense perception fluids
components fluids happen ingesting. Now, parallel pathways,
describing them, fundamental feature every sensory system, not just
taste system, also visual system. parallel pathways perceiving dark
objects versus light objects, perceiving red versus green, et cetera.
fundamental feature built nervous system works,
taste system, much like systems, pathways indeed parallel,
converge, can influence one another, think simplest way put
context, first, visual system, whereby ability detect color
red everything fact neurons eye absorb long
wavelengths light call reds, red wavelengths light, longer
wavelengths than, say, blue light, shorter wavelength, really
comparison electrical activity neurons absorb red light activity
neurons absorb green light actually gives perception red,
might seem little counterintuitive, indeed, not. actually
something red less greenness perceive red green,


actually way entire nervous system works aren't really
good evaluating absolute levels anything context perception.
comparison, actually, fun experiment can do, think
probably find easily online, also experiment home. can
stare something red, green, matter, while, make active
decision not blink stare something red, look away
thing, actually see green afterimage red object. Conversely,
look something green while, stare it, look away,
will see red afterimage thing. Now, taste system doesn't quite
aftertaste type effect, nonetheless, pathways, parallel pathways
salty parallel pathways sweet bitter can actually interact,
important relevance context food choices sugar craving. One
things commonplace nowadays many processed foods business,
literally, business putting so-called hidden sugars, hidden sugars not
always form caloric sugars. sometimes form artificial
sweeteners various foods, might say, "Well, "why put
sugar food "and disguise sugary taste "given sweet tastes often
compel people "to eat things?" Well, way, actually, bypassing
homeostatic mechanisms sweet, even though might think
sweet stuff eat, sweet stuff crave, general, people
threshold whereby say, "Okay, enough sugary stuff." can actually
experience this. ever feel like something really, really sweet, take little sip
water little bit lemon juice vinegar, will quickly quench overly
sweet sensation perception. will disappear almost immediately. actually
practice fancy meals cleansing palate ingestion different foods,
idea cleansing palate. actually neutralizing
previous taste can bring yet another dish overindulge decadence
forth, sensory systems interact way. putting sugars foods
hiding sugary taste foods, foods, even contain artificial
sweeteners, can activate sorts neurons talked beginning
episode, like neuropod cells will signal brain release
dopamine make crave food, whereas able
perceive true sweetness food, might consumed less, indeed,
happens, hidden sugars kind diabolical. talking


context episode salt? Well, many probably
noticed, lot foods contain salty-sweet combination,
combination salty sweet can actually lead consume
salty-sweet food just sweet just salty,
sweet taste salty taste homeostatic balance,
ingest something very, salty, pretty soon appetite salty foods will
reduced, mask sweet, well, interactions

magnesium citrate fairly effective laxative, not known promote sleep things
sort, lot different forms magnesium, still forms there.
Many people not getting enough magnesium. Many people are. Okay,
magnesium. Anytime talking sodium balance, take
consideration potassium way kidney works way
sodium balance regulated, body brain, sodium
potassium working close concert one another. lot different
recommendations ratios there, range widely two-to-one ratio
potassium sodium. heard direction too. heard two-to-one
sodium potassium. recommendations vary. One sponsors podcast,
instance, LMNT, talked episode before, ratio
gram sodium 200 milligrams potassium, 60 milligrams magnesium, there,
opted five-to-one ratio sodium potassium, and, course, many people
opt make hydration electrolyte formulas. put sea salt
water, maybe even ingest potassium tablet. depends context,
important contextual element diet, so, instance, carbohydrates hold water

probably also lose sodium potassium, people, many people,
fact, find lower low-carbohydrate diet, need make

many people, not eating easier portion control certain parts day,
find beneficial limit calories overall given amount, depending

not just water, caffeine, caffeine diuretic. actually causes excretion
fluids body part, causes excretion sodium. say
somebody who, instance, eats first meal around noon 1:00
2:00 p.m., fasting early part day, drinking coffee
tea ingesting lot water, going excreting sodium along
water, many people, including myself, find useful, especially
drinking caffeine so-called fasting nonfood intake part time-restricted
feeding, making sure get enough salt, either form something like
LMNT, electrolyte drink, putting sea salt water, certainly,
anytime one ingesting caffeine, replacing lost water increasing one's
water intake. simple rules thumb around think can get
people place comfortable functioning better,
every ounce coffee tea drink, say caffeinated coffee tea
drink, consume 1 1/2 times much water, say 8-

12-ounce glass water, might want put tiny bit sodium that. tiny
bit, just mean tiny pinch sodium remember, even talking


increasing amount sodium intake overall, total amount sodium contained
salt sufficiently high even just 1/4 teaspoon going really start move
number towards range still within safe range, going to,
keep day long, quickly going get excessive salt

going excreting water salt potassium, going
find ways bring water, salt, potassium back in. Again, evaluated
individual situations. exercising fasted,
drinking caffeine, before, during, certainly exercise,

01:32:28 General Recommendations Salt Intake

going want replenish fluids electrolytes lost, including
sodium, can imagine starts become pretty dizzying, yet
doesn't dizzying. can provide useful ranges that, people,
will work, talk ranges are, going point
resource explores ranges various contexts nutrition,
exercise, on. resource book authored Dr. James
DiNicolantonio. not medical doctor. scientist, cardiovascular
physiology well, believe, doctor pharmacy, title book "The
Salt Fix." "The Salt Fix" interesting read points to, first all, history
salt society relates health. actually emphasizes major
missteps, maybe even pretty drastic errors, made terms trying
interpret role salt various diseases emphasizes ways
which, perhaps, increasing salt can actually improve health outcomes, think
strikes pretty nice balance commonly known salt
believe known salt, least taken consideration. book
provide certain recommendations, actually reached author. never
met person talked directly, asked outright. said, "How much
salt "do recommend people take average?" gave, course,
appropriate caveats prehypertension, hypertension, et cetera, made
recommendation just share you, want learn
support recommendation, can check book. recommendation
made anywhere 8 12 grams salt day, corresponds 3.2 4.8


grams sodium, going back current recommendations talked
before, 2.3 grams sodium per day, 1 1/2 times double amount
sodium currently recommended circles, then, corresponds
1 1/2 2 teaspoons salt per day arrive 3.2 4.8 grams sodium.
Again, recommendation passed along people,
conditions, barring specific health issues. Now, also interesting pointed
sodium-to-potassium ratio, 4 grams potassium, also mentioned 400
milligrams magnesium, pointed out, generally agree here, many people
deficient magnesium, again, 3.2 4.8 grams sodium, 4 grams
potassium. might think, "Well, gosh, "that's 1 1/2 2 times current
recommendation," can go back study mentioned earlier
episode, 2011 study, describe sort J-shaped curve which,
look occurrence negative health events, fairly low low
sodium intake, lower still slightly higher sodium intake, much line
recommendations made Dr. DiNicolantonio passed along me,
then, increased quite, health risks increased quite substantially one moves
past 6 grams sodium, 7 grams sodium per day. things really
seem get hazardous, really, makes sense, think, given consensus around
this, really avoid high salt intake, "The Salt Fix" describes rationale behind
recommendations. "The Salt Fix" also describes, quite beautiful detail,
relationship salt intake, potassium intake,

01:36:34 Perception Salt & Sugar Taste, Processed Foods

relationship sugar consumption system. like pick idea
relationship salt sugar think one key aspect way
salt can work can benefit us can harm us way sodium
sugar regulated actually perceived brain how, conditions
certain levels sodium intake, might inspired seek sugar crave
sweets less, now, talking salt substance
way regulate fluid balance blood volume on. haven't talked lot
salt taste taste things salty, yet know salt

locations throughout digestive tract, although sensation taste salt
actually exerts robust effect certain areas brain can either make us
crave sate, meaning fulfill, desire salt, can imagine
important. brain actually register whether not bringing
salt order know whether not going crave salt not,
beautiful work done Zuker Lab, Z-U-K-E-R, Zuker Lab Columbia

parallel meaning pathways represent sweet presence sweet taste

foods happen ingesting sense perception fluids
components fluids happen ingesting. Now, parallel pathways,
describing them, fundamental feature every sensory system, not just
taste system, also visual system. parallel pathways perceiving dark
objects versus light objects, perceiving red versus green, et cetera.
fundamental feature built nervous system works,
taste system, much like systems, pathways indeed parallel,
converge, can influence one another, think simplest way put
context, first, visual system, whereby ability detect color
red everything fact neurons eye absorb long
wavelengths light call reds, red wavelengths light, longer
wavelengths than, say, blue light, shorter wavelength, really
comparison electrical activity neurons absorb red light activity
neurons absorb green light actually gives perception red,
might seem little counterintuitive, indeed, not. actually
something red less greenness perceive red green,


actually way entire nervous system works aren't really
good evaluating absolute levels anything context perception.
comparison, actually, fun experiment can do, think
probably find easily online, also experiment home. can
stare something red, green, matter, while, make active
decision not blink stare something red, look away
thing, actually see green afterimage red object. Conversely,
look something green while, stare it, look away,
will see red afterimage thing. Now, taste system doesn't quite
aftertaste type effect, nonetheless, pathways, parallel pathways
salty parallel pathways sweet bitter can actually interact,
important relevance context food choices sugar craving. One
things commonplace nowadays many processed foods business,
literally, business putting so-called hidden sugars, hidden sugars not
always form caloric sugars. sometimes form artificial
sweeteners various foods, might say, "Well, "why put
sugar food "and disguise sugary taste "given sweet tastes often
compel people "to eat things?" Well, way, actually, bypassing
homeostatic mechanisms sweet, even though might think
sweet stuff eat, sweet stuff crave, general, people

experience this. ever feel like something really, really sweet, take little sip
water little bit lemon juice vinegar, will quickly quench overly
sweet sensation perception. will disappear almost immediately. actually
practice fancy meals cleansing palate ingestion different foods,
idea cleansing palate. actually neutralizing
previous taste can bring yet another dish overindulge decadence
forth, sensory systems interact way. putting sugars foods
hiding sugary taste foods, foods, even contain artificial
sweeteners, can activate sorts neurons talked beginning
episode, like neuropod cells will signal brain release
dopamine make crave food, whereas able
perceive true sweetness food, might consumed less, indeed,
happens, hidden sugars kind diabolical. talking


context episode salt? Well, many probably
noticed, lot foods contain salty-sweet combination,
combination salty sweet can actually lead consume
salty-sweet food just sweet just salty,
sweet taste salty taste homeostatic balance,
ingest something very, salty, pretty soon appetite salty foods will
reduced, mask sweet, well, interactions
parallel pathways, somewhat shut perception much salt

01:47:13 Role Sodium Neuronal Function, Action Potentials

salty sweet interact. Now, thus far, already covered quite lot material,
completely remiss didn't emphasize crucial role sodium plays
way neurons function. fact, sodium one key elements allows
neurons function all, way engaging call action
potential. action potential firing electrical activity neurons. Now, neurons
can engage electrical activity number different ways. graded
potentials. gap junctions. whole landscape different
electrophysiologies neurons don't want go just yet, least not
episode, action potential fundamental way neurons communicate
one another. sometimes called spikes. just kind nomenclature
neuroscientists use. just going briefly describe action potential role
sodium plays, will involve little bit chemistry, promise will
accessible anyone, even don't chemistry physics background
electrophysiology background. Neurons inside outside, inside
things like genetic material. bunch things floating around
allow cells function, tend wire extending them,
sometimes long wire, sometimes short one, call axon,


end wire, axon, release little packets chemicals either cause
next neuron fire action potentials prevent next neuron firing action
potentials, kind vomit little packets chemicals either inspire
suppress action potentials neurons. way whole process occurs
given neuron needs change electrical activity, normally, neurons
hanging out, call negative charge, reason
negative charge inside cell things floating around like
potassium, little bit sodium, stuff like chloride. literally just, just
imagine little balls stuff, negative charge them,
inside cell going tend negative, outside cell, turns out,
going bunch stuff positively charged, one main
factors creating positive charge sodium. Sodium carries positive charge,
neurons can just imagine a, sake discussion, can just
imagine sphere little wire sticking it. can put little minus
inside negative. can put little plus outside positive,
neuron stimulated another neuron, stimulation, electrical stimulation
sufficiently high, meaning enough little packets neurotransmitter vomited
onto surface sufficient concentration, happens little pores, little spaces, little
gaps open membrane cell separates inside outside,
positive, lot positive charge outside, lot
negative inside, like boulder running downhill. stuff tends rush downhill.
tries create even amounts charge, negative inside, positive
outside, happens sodium rushes cell carrying lot charge
cell, consequence, charge cell goes negative, actually,
negative, quite positive, hits certain threshold positive charge
sodium ions going cell, fires called action potential,
vomits set chemicals onto next neuron, sets off chain one
neuron goes negative positive, blech, vomits chemicals onto next one.
next one, next neuron, binds receptors enters cell, cell
goes negative positive charge, [imitates vomiting] vomits contents onto
next cell, forth. Sodium rushing cell, therefore, way
action potential stimulated. words, sodium way neurons
communicate one another. Now, neurons don't stay positive charge.
Otherwise, just keep vomiting contents, [imitates vomiting],


need maintain that, need go back preparing next
time next time resting bit, turns way restore
charge pushing sodium back cell. mechanisms place
that, things like so-called sodium-potassium pump. change levels
potassium across cell membrane forth. want look

relates episode salt, sufficient levels salt system allows
brain function, allows nervous system function all. Again,
basic aspect nervous system function, cases whole
system gets disrupted, brings us topic sodium water balance.
many probably heard,

01:53:13 Dehydration

hopefully, haven't, take message seriously, drink much
water, especially short amount time, can actually kill yourself, right?
certainly don't want happen. ingest lot water short period
time, something called hypernatremia, will excrete lot sodium quickly,
ability regulate kidney function will disrupted, addition that, brain
can actually stop functioning, people actually consumed water excess,
especially sports events forth, water doesn't contain sufficient
electrolytes, can actually shut neurons' ability function disrupting
balance sodium potassium amount extracellular sodium
neurons' ability signal one another action potentials, can't emphasize
importance action potentials enough. way can lift pen right
now. way can speak. way breathe. literally
control aspects nervous system function. Now, takes quite lot water
intake excrete enough sodium nervous system going shut
down, certainly don't want give impression simply ingesting


sodium, neurons will work better, absolutely case don't ingest
enough sodium, neurons won't function well could,
sodium levels made low hemorrhage ingesting much water, fluid,
excrete excess amounts sodium mechanism, is,
indeed neurons won't able fire action potentials brain nervous
system simply won't work, one primary reasons dehydration leads
confusion dizziness lack coordination, talked bit
episode endurance, instances competitive athletes come
stadium finish final lap long endurance race completely
disoriented actually can't find way finish line. might sound like kind
silly, crazy example, examples people severe mental issues
physical issues post-exercise exercise involved ton sweating hot

keeping mind lot information runs counter typical narrative
hear around salt, nonetheless, interesting points
might want consider certainly will broaden view history
applications salt relates great number health performance metrics.
also talked perception salt, meaning perception salty tastes
perception salty tastes perception tastes, like sweet, can
interact one another drive things like increased sugar intake not
even aware it, indeed, combination salty sweet taste can bias
towards craving more, instance, processed foods, might good
thing avoid, and, course, talked salt critical role action

01:47:13 Role Sodium Neuronal Function, Action Potentials

salty sweet interact. Now, thus far, already covered quite lot material,
completely remiss didn't emphasize crucial role sodium plays
way neurons function. fact, sodium one key elements allows
neurons function all, way engaging call action
potential. action potential firing electrical activity neurons. Now, neurons
can engage electrical activity number different ways. graded
potentials. gap junctions. whole landscape different
electrophysiologies neurons don't want go just yet, least not
episode, action potential fundamental way neurons communicate
one another. sometimes called spikes. just kind nomenclature
neuroscientists use. just going briefly describe action potential role
sodium plays, will involve little bit chemistry, promise will
accessible anyone, even don't chemistry physics background
electrophysiology background. Neurons inside outside, inside
things like genetic material. bunch things floating around
allow cells function, tend wire extending them,
sometimes long wire, sometimes short one, call axon,


end wire, axon, release little packets chemicals either cause
next neuron fire action potentials prevent next neuron firing action
potentials, kind vomit little packets chemicals either inspire
suppress action potentials neurons. way whole process occurs
given neuron needs change electrical activity, normally, neurons
hanging out, call negative charge, reason
negative charge inside cell things floating around like
potassium, little bit sodium, stuff like chloride. literally just, just
imagine little balls stuff, negative charge them,
inside cell going tend negative, outside cell, turns out,
going bunch stuff positively charged, one main
factors creating positive charge sodium. Sodium carries positive charge,
neurons can just imagine a, sake discussion, can just
imagine sphere little wire sticking it. can put little minus
inside negative. can put little plus outside positive,
neuron stimulated another neuron, stimulation, electrical stimulation
sufficiently high, meaning enough little packets neurotransmitter vomited
onto surface sufficient concentration, happens little pores, little spaces, little
gaps open membrane cell separates inside outside,
positive, lot positive charge outside, lot
negative inside, like boulder running downhill. stuff tends rush downhill.
tries create even amounts charge, negative inside, positive
outside, happens sodium rushes cell carrying lot charge
cell, consequence, charge cell goes negative, actually,
negative, quite positive, hits certain threshold positive charge
sodium ions going cell, fires called action potential,
vomits set chemicals onto next neuron, sets off chain one
neuron goes negative positive, blech, vomits chemicals onto next one.
next one, next neuron, binds receptors enters cell, cell
goes negative positive charge, [imitates vomiting] vomits contents onto
next cell, forth. Sodium rushing cell, therefore, way
action potential stimulated. words, sodium way neurons
communicate one another. Now, neurons don't stay positive charge.
Otherwise, just keep vomiting contents, [imitates vomiting],


need maintain that, need go back preparing next
time next time resting bit, turns way restore

many probably heard,

01:53:13 Dehydration

hopefully, haven't, take message seriously, drink much
water, especially short amount time, can actually kill yourself, right?
certainly don't want happen. ingest lot water short period
time, something called hypernatremia, will excrete lot sodium quickly,
ability regulate kidney function will disrupted, addition that, brain
can actually stop functioning, people actually consumed water excess,
especially sports events forth, water doesn't contain sufficient
electrolytes, can actually shut neurons' ability function disrupting
balance sodium potassium amount extracellular sodium
neurons' ability signal one another action potentials, can't emphasize

now. way can speak. way breathe. literally
control aspects nervous system function. Now, takes quite lot water

down, certainly don't want give impression simply ingesting


sodium, neurons will work better, absolutely case don't ingest
enough sodium, neurons won't function well could,
sodium levels made low hemorrhage ingesting much water, fluid,
excrete excess amounts sodium mechanism, is,
indeed neurons won't able fire action potentials brain nervous

keeping mind lot information runs counter typical narrative
hear around salt, nonetheless, interesting points
might want consider certainly will broaden view history
applications salt relates great number health performance metrics.
also talked perception salt, meaning perception salty tastes
perception salty tastes perception tastes, like sweet, can
interact one another drive things like increased sugar intake not
even aware it, indeed, combination salty sweet taste can bias

01:32:28 General Recommendations Salt Intake

going want replenish fluids electrolytes lost, including

doesn't dizzying. can provide useful ranges that, people,
will work, talk ranges are, going point
resource explores ranges various contexts nutrition,
exercise, on. resource book authored Dr. James
DiNicolantonio. not medical doctor. scientist, cardiovascular
physiology well, believe, doctor pharmacy, title book "The
Salt Fix." "The Salt Fix" interesting read points to, first all, history
salt society relates health. actually emphasizes major
missteps, maybe even pretty drastic errors, made terms trying
interpret role salt various diseases emphasizes ways
which, perhaps, increasing salt can actually improve health outcomes, think
strikes pretty nice balance commonly known salt
believe known salt, least taken consideration. book
provide certain recommendations, actually reached author. never
met person talked directly, asked outright. said, "How much
salt "do recommend people take average?" gave, course,
appropriate caveats prehypertension, hypertension, et cetera, made
recommendation just share you, want learn
support recommendation, can check book. recommendation
made anywhere 8 12 grams salt day, corresponds 3.2 4.8


grams sodium, going back current recommendations talked
before, 2.3 grams sodium per day, 1 1/2 times double amount
sodium currently recommended circles, then, corresponds
1 1/2 2 teaspoons salt per day arrive 3.2 4.8 grams sodium.
Again, recommendation passed along people,
conditions, barring specific health issues. Now, also interesting pointed
sodium-to-potassium ratio, 4 grams potassium, also mentioned 400
milligrams magnesium, pointed out, generally agree here, many people
deficient magnesium, again, 3.2 4.8 grams sodium, 4 grams
potassium. might think, "Well, gosh, "that's 1 1/2 2 times current
recommendation," can go back study mentioned earlier
episode, 2011 study, describe sort J-shaped curve which,
look occurrence negative health events, fairly low low
sodium intake, lower still slightly higher sodium intake, much line
recommendations made Dr. DiNicolantonio passed along me,
then, increased quite, health risks increased quite substantially one moves
past 6 grams sodium, 7 grams sodium per day. things really
seem get hazardous, really, makes sense, think, given consensus around
this, really avoid high salt intake, "The Salt Fix" describes rationale behind
recommendations. "The Salt Fix" also describes, quite beautiful detail,
relationship salt intake, potassium intake,

grams sodium, going back current recommendations talked
before, 2.3 grams sodium per day, 1 1/2 times double amount
sodium currently recommended circles, then, corresponds
1 1/2 2 teaspoons salt per day arrive 3.2 4.8 grams sodium.
Again, recommendation passed along people,
conditions, barring specific health issues. Now, also interesting pointed
sodium-to-potassium ratio, 4 grams potassium, also mentioned 400
milligrams magnesium, pointed out, generally agree here, many people
deficient magnesium, again, 3.2 4.8 grams sodium, 4 grams
potassium. might think, "Well, gosh, "that's 1 1/2 2 times current
recommendation," can go back study mentioned earlier
episode, 2011 study, describe sort J-shaped curve which,
look occurrence negative health events, fairly low low
sodium intake, lower still slightly higher sodium intake, much line
recommendations made Dr. DiNicolantonio passed along me,
then, increased quite, health risks increased quite substantially one moves
past 6 grams sodium, 7 grams sodium per day. things really
seem get hazardous, really, makes sense, think, given consensus around
this, really avoid high salt intake, "The Salt Fix" describes rationale behind
recommendations. "The Salt Fix" also describes, quite beautiful detail,
relationship salt intake, potassium intake,

01:36:34 Perception Salt & Sugar Taste, Processed Foods

relationship sugar consumption system. like pick idea
relationship salt sugar think one key aspect way
salt can work can benefit us can harm us way sodium
sugar regulated actually perceived brain how, conditions
certain levels sodium intake, might inspired seek sugar crave
sweets less, now, talking salt substance
way regulate fluid balance blood volume on. haven't talked lot
salt taste taste things salty, yet know salt
receptors, meaning neurons, fire action potentials salty substances
detected, much way sweet detectors bitter detectors,


detectors umami, savory flavor, tongue, earlier,
beginning episode, talked fact sweet receptors, neurons
respond presence sugar even noncaloric sweet things gut,
signals brain vagus nerve, signals converge
pathways relate dopamine on. Well, also salt sensors various
locations throughout digestive tract, although sensation taste salt
actually exerts robust effect certain areas brain can either make us
crave sate, meaning fulfill, desire salt, can imagine
important. brain actually register whether not bringing
salt order know whether not going crave salt not,
beautiful work done Zuker Lab, Z-U-K-E-R, Zuker Lab Columbia
University, well many labs used imaging techniques
techniques molecular biology define so-called parallel pathways,
parallel meaning pathways represent sweet presence sweet taste
mouth gut, parallel pathways, meaning neural circuits represent presence
salty tastes mouth gut on, go brain, move
brain stem centers neocortex indeed seed

foods happen ingesting sense perception fluids
components fluids happen ingesting. Now, parallel pathways,
describing them, fundamental feature every sensory system, not just
taste system, also visual system. parallel pathways perceiving dark
objects versus light objects, perceiving red versus green, et cetera.
fundamental feature built nervous system works,
taste system, much like systems, pathways indeed parallel,
converge, can influence one another, think simplest way put
context, first, visual system, whereby ability detect color
red everything fact neurons eye absorb long
wavelengths light call reds, red wavelengths light, longer
wavelengths than, say, blue light, shorter wavelength, really
comparison electrical activity neurons absorb red light activity
neurons absorb green light actually gives perception red,
might seem little counterintuitive, indeed, not. actually
something red less greenness perceive red green,


actually way entire nervous system works aren't really
good evaluating absolute levels anything context perception.
comparison, actually, fun experiment can do, think
probably find easily online, also experiment home. can
stare something red, green, matter, while, make active
decision not blink stare something red, look away
thing, actually see green afterimage red object. Conversely,
look something green while, stare it, look away,
will see red afterimage thing. Now, taste system doesn't quite

forth, sensory systems interact way. putting sugars foods
hiding sugary taste foods, foods, even contain artificial

happens, hidden sugars kind diabolical. talking


context episode salt? Well, many probably
noticed, lot foods contain salty-sweet combination,
combination salty sweet can actually lead consume
salty-sweet food just sweet just salty,
sweet taste salty taste homeostatic balance,
ingest something very, salty, pretty soon appetite salty foods will
reduced, mask sweet, well, interactions

01:47:13 Role Sodium Neuronal Function, Action Potentials

salty sweet interact. Now, thus far, already covered quite lot material,
completely remiss didn't emphasize crucial role sodium plays
way neurons function. fact, sodium one key elements allows
neurons function all, way engaging call action
potential. action potential firing electrical activity neurons. Now, neurons
can engage electrical activity number different ways. graded
potentials. gap junctions. whole landscape different
electrophysiologies neurons don't want go just yet, least not
episode, action potential fundamental way neurons communicate
one another. sometimes called spikes. just kind nomenclature
neuroscientists use. just going briefly describe action potential role
sodium plays, will involve little bit chemistry, promise will
accessible anyone, even don't chemistry physics background
electrophysiology background. Neurons inside outside, inside
things like genetic material. bunch things floating around
allow cells function, tend wire extending them,
sometimes long wire, sometimes short one, call axon,


end wire, axon, release little packets chemicals either cause
next neuron fire action potentials prevent next neuron firing action
potentials, kind vomit little packets chemicals either inspire
suppress action potentials neurons. way whole process occurs
given neuron needs change electrical activity, normally, neurons
hanging out, call negative charge, reason
negative charge inside cell things floating around like
potassium, little bit sodium, stuff like chloride. literally just, just
imagine little balls stuff, negative charge them,
inside cell going tend negative, outside cell, turns out,
going bunch stuff positively charged, one main
factors creating positive charge sodium. Sodium carries positive charge,
neurons can just imagine a, sake discussion, can just
imagine sphere little wire sticking it. can put little minus
inside negative. can put little plus outside positive,
neuron stimulated another neuron, stimulation, electrical stimulation
sufficiently high, meaning enough little packets neurotransmitter vomited
onto surface sufficient concentration, happens little pores, little spaces, little
gaps open membrane cell separates inside outside,
positive, lot positive charge outside, lot
negative inside, like boulder running downhill. stuff tends rush downhill.
tries create even amounts charge, negative inside, positive
outside, happens sodium rushes cell carrying lot charge
cell, consequence, charge cell goes negative, actually,
negative, quite positive, hits certain threshold positive charge
sodium ions going cell, fires called action potential,
vomits set chemicals onto next neuron, sets off chain one
neuron goes negative positive, blech, vomits chemicals onto next one.
next one, next neuron, binds receptors enters cell, cell
goes negative positive charge, [imitates vomiting] vomits contents onto
next cell, forth. Sodium rushing cell, therefore, way
action potential stimulated. words, sodium way neurons
communicate one another. Now, neurons don't stay positive charge.
Otherwise, just keep vomiting contents, [imitates vomiting],


need maintain that, need go back preparing next

relates episode salt, sufficient levels salt system allows
brain function, allows nervous system function all. Again,
basic aspect nervous system function, cases whole
system gets disrupted, brings us topic sodium water balance.
many probably heard,

01:53:13 Dehydration

hopefully, haven't, take message seriously, drink much
water, especially short amount time, can actually kill yourself, right?
certainly don't want happen. ingest lot water short period
time, something called hypernatremia, will excrete lot sodium quickly,
ability regulate kidney function will disrupted, addition that, brain
can actually stop functioning, people actually consumed water excess,
especially sports events forth, water doesn't contain sufficient
electrolytes, can actually shut neurons' ability function disrupting
balance sodium potassium amount extracellular sodium
neurons' ability signal one another action potentials, can't emphasize
importance action potentials enough. way can lift pen right
now. way can speak. way breathe. literally
control aspects nervous system function. Now, takes quite lot water

down, certainly don't want give impression simply ingesting


sodium, neurons will work better, absolutely case don't ingest
enough sodium, neurons won't function well could,
sodium levels made low hemorrhage ingesting much water, fluid,
excrete excess amounts sodium mechanism, is,
indeed neurons won't able fire action potentials brain nervous
system simply won't work, one primary reasons dehydration leads

01:55:36 Salt Intake Best You?

just learned, sodium absolutely crucial neurons function, briefly
recap talked today, talked brain monitors
amount salt brain body relates thirst drive
consume fluid and/or salty fluids. also talked little bit hormones

applications salt relates great number health performance metrics.
also talked perception salt, meaning perception salty tastes
perception salty tastes perception tastes, like sweet, can
interact one another drive things like increased sugar intake not
even aware it, indeed, combination salty sweet taste can bias

thing, actually see green afterimage red object. Conversely,
look something green while, stare it, look away,
will see red afterimage thing. Now, taste system doesn't quite
aftertaste type effect, nonetheless, pathways, parallel pathways
salty parallel pathways sweet bitter can actually interact,
important relevance context food choices sugar craving. One
things commonplace nowadays many processed foods business,
literally, business putting so-called hidden sugars, hidden sugars not
always form caloric sugars. sometimes form artificial
sweeteners various foods, might say, "Well, "why put
sugar food "and disguise sugary taste "given sweet tastes often
compel people "to eat things?" Well, way, actually, bypassing
homeostatic mechanisms sweet, even though might think
sweet stuff eat, sweet stuff crave, general, people
threshold whereby say, "Okay, enough sugary stuff." can actually
experience this. ever feel like something really, really sweet, take little sip
water little bit lemon juice vinegar, will quickly quench overly
sweet sensation perception. will disappear almost immediately. actually
practice fancy meals cleansing palate ingestion different foods,
idea cleansing palate. actually neutralizing
previous taste can bring yet another dish overindulge decadence
forth, sensory systems interact way. putting sugars foods
hiding sugary taste foods, foods, even contain artificial
sweeteners, can activate sorts neurons talked beginning
episode, like neuropod cells will signal brain release
dopamine make crave food, whereas able
perceive true sweetness food, might consumed less, indeed,
happens, hidden sugars kind diabolical. talking


context episode salt? Well, many probably
noticed, lot foods contain salty-sweet combination,
combination salty sweet can actually lead consume
salty-sweet food just sweet just salty,

01:47:13 Role Sodium Neuronal Function, Action Potentials

salty sweet interact. Now, thus far, already covered quite lot material,
completely remiss didn't emphasize crucial role sodium plays
way neurons function. fact, sodium one key elements allows
neurons function all, way engaging call action

can engage electrical activity number different ways. graded
potentials. gap junctions. whole landscape different
electrophysiologies neurons don't want go just yet, least not

neuroscientists use. just going briefly describe action potential role
sodium plays, will involve little bit chemistry, promise will
accessible anyone, even don't chemistry physics background
electrophysiology background. Neurons inside outside, inside
things like genetic material. bunch things floating around
allow cells function, tend wire extending them,
sometimes long wire, sometimes short one, call axon,


end wire, axon, release little packets chemicals either cause

given neuron needs change electrical activity, normally, neurons
hanging out, call negative charge, reason
negative charge inside cell things floating around like
potassium, little bit sodium, stuff like chloride. literally just, just

cell, consequence, charge cell goes negative, actually,
negative, quite positive, hits certain threshold positive charge
sodium ions going cell, fires called action potential,
vomits set chemicals onto next neuron, sets off chain one
neuron goes negative positive, blech, vomits chemicals onto next one.
next one, next neuron, binds receptors enters cell, cell
goes negative positive charge, [imitates vomiting] vomits contents onto
next cell, forth. Sodium rushing cell, therefore, way
action potential stimulated. words, sodium way neurons
communicate one another. Now, neurons don't stay positive charge.
Otherwise, just keep vomiting contents, [imitates vomiting],


need maintain that, need go back preparing next

many probably heard,

01:53:13 Dehydration

hopefully, haven't, take message seriously, drink much
water, especially short amount time, can actually kill yourself, right?
certainly don't want happen. ingest lot water short period
time, something called hypernatremia, will excrete lot sodium quickly,
ability regulate kidney function will disrupted, addition that, brain
can actually stop functioning, people actually consumed water excess,
especially sports events forth, water doesn't contain sufficient
electrolytes, can actually shut neurons' ability function disrupting

control aspects nervous system function. Now, takes quite lot water

down, certainly don't want give impression simply ingesting


sodium, neurons will work better, absolutely case don't ingest
enough sodium, neurons won't function well could,
sodium levels made low hemorrhage ingesting much water, fluid,
excrete excess amounts sodium mechanism, is,
indeed neurons won't able fire action potentials brain nervous

01:55:36 Salt Intake Best You?

just learned, sodium absolutely crucial neurons function, briefly
recap talked today, talked brain monitors
amount salt brain body relates thirst drive
consume fluid and/or salty fluids. also talked little bit hormones
come brain operate level kidney order either retain
allow water leave system. Talked little bit function kidney itself,
beautiful organ. talked relationship salt intake various
health parameters particular range salt intake might optimal, depending
context range consumed, meaning depending whether
not hypertensive, prehypertensive, normal tension. talked fluid
intake electrolyte intake, sodium, potassium, magnesium context
athletic sports performance, also, terms maintaining cognitive function.
Talked Galpin equation, easily adapt body weight
circumstances. course, adjusting amount fluid electrolyte intake
upwards exercising working hot environments, downwards, maybe,
less hot environments sweating less on. also talked
relationship stress system salt craving system


two systems interact why, people may suffer bit anxiety
conditions stress, increasing salt intake, provided done healthy
means, might actually beneficial. also talked conditions increasing
salt intake might beneficial offsetting low blood pressure,
postural syndromes can lead people dizziness forth. things
explored individual basis, and, course, explored
support doctor. mentioned "The Salt Fix," think interesting read,
keeping mind lot information runs counter typical narrative
hear around salt, nonetheless, interesting points
might want consider certainly will broaden view history
applications salt relates great number health performance metrics.
also talked perception salt, meaning perception salty tastes
perception salty tastes perception tastes, like sweet, can
interact one another drive things like increased sugar intake not
even aware it, indeed, combination salty sweet taste can bias
towards craving more, instance, processed foods, might good
thing avoid, and, course, talked salt critical role action
potential, fundamental way nervous system functions all, hope
you, listening episode, consider question, question
salt intake best you? place question context
fluid intake, place context diet following, amount
caffeine might ingesting, diuretic effects caffeine, crucially,
place context electrolytes, generally, meaning sodium,
potassium, magnesium. Someday, will online program app,
imagine, one put bunch different parameters particular
health status, particular diet, particular exercise, et cetera. Maybe
run AI algorithm something monitor us,
spit us precise amount sodium take day.
Unfortunately, no tool device exists right now, us figure
appropriate amount sodium intake ourselves, done
contextual considerations. knows? Maybe one will design app
device. think useful. nothing else, today's discussion
illuminate fact strict recommendation salt intake cannot made
universally across board everybody. just simply no way


done, yet, think learned salt general discussions
around health evil substance. Nothing truth.
incredible substance. physiology dependent it. cognition dependent
it. Indeed, mental physical health performance essentially
aspects life dependent it, hope able illuminate
beautiful ways brain bodily organs interact order help us

next neuron fire action potentials prevent next neuron firing action
potentials, kind vomit little packets chemicals either inspire
suppress action potentials neurons. way whole process occurs
given neuron needs change electrical activity, normally, neurons
hanging out, call negative charge, reason
negative charge inside cell things floating around like
potassium, little bit sodium, stuff like chloride. literally just, just
imagine little balls stuff, negative charge them,
inside cell going tend negative, outside cell, turns out,
going bunch stuff positively charged, one main
factors creating positive charge sodium. Sodium carries positive charge,
neurons can just imagine a, sake discussion, can just
imagine sphere little wire sticking it. can put little minus
inside negative. can put little plus outside positive,
neuron stimulated another neuron, stimulation, electrical stimulation
sufficiently high, meaning enough little packets neurotransmitter vomited
onto surface sufficient concentration, happens little pores, little spaces, little
gaps open membrane cell separates inside outside,
positive, lot positive charge outside, lot
negative inside, like boulder running downhill. stuff tends rush downhill.
tries create even amounts charge, negative inside, positive
outside, happens sodium rushes cell carrying lot charge
cell, consequence, charge cell goes negative, actually,
negative, quite positive, hits certain threshold positive charge
sodium ions going cell, fires called action potential,
vomits set chemicals onto next neuron, sets off chain one
neuron goes negative positive, blech, vomits chemicals onto next one.
next one, next neuron, binds receptors enters cell, cell
goes negative positive charge, [imitates vomiting] vomits contents onto
next cell, forth. Sodium rushing cell, therefore, way
action potential stimulated. words, sodium way neurons
communicate one another. Now, neurons don't stay positive charge.
Otherwise, just keep vomiting contents, [imitates vomiting],
