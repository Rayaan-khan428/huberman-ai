00:06:30 Stress: Short & Long-Term, Good & Bad

now without ado, conversation Dr. Robert Sapolsky. Great, well,
thank much, Robert, joining us today. looking forward
long time appreciate it. - Oh yes, glad here. - enormous
range topics drill into, just start off, want return topic
near dear heart, stress. one questions get


commonly is, difference short long-term stress terms
benefits drawbacks? reason say benefits that, obviously stress
stress response can keep us alive, stress, course, can also sharpen
mental acuity things sort. conceptualize stress
conceptualize stress short-term long-term? - Well, basically
sort two graphs one draw. first one just sorts beneficial effects
stress short-term, get chronicity, just downhill there.
Short-term saves predator, short-term giving
presentation think clearly focus better, sorts aspects
that. winds argument is, long take go
short-term long-term? somewhat arbitrary, sorts chronic stressors
people deal just undeniably chronic range, like spent
last 20 years, daily traffic jams abusive boss thing. curve
sort perpendicular dealing fact sometimes stress great
thing. Like goal not cure people stress right kind, love it.
pay good money stressed way scary movie rollercoaster ride.
wind seeing right amount stress, call
stimulation. basic curve is, optimal level stimulation
little, function goes call boredom, much
function goes

00:09:11 Valence & Amygdala

call stress. optimum us aim for. - terms
benefits stress short-term, one thing really striking is,
physiologically stress response looks much like excitement response
positive event. can speculate fundamental difference short-
term stress short-term excitement neuromodulator like dopamine
something like that. anything else know biology
reveals us? really creates thing call valence experience can
terrible feel awful, can feel wonderful, exhilarating depending somewhat
subjective feature call valence? know valence resides? -
really mechanical level, circumstance requiring heart
races breathing fast using muscles thing,


going roughly brain activation profile, whether
something wonderful something terrible one exception
amygdala part activation, something going counting
adverse. Whether circumstance, adverse circumstance recruiting
amygdala it, much amygdala involved, biases towards
interpreting even awful.

00:11:00 Testosterone: Common Myths vs. Actual Truths

amygdala ways kind checkpoint whether talking
excitement terror. - use amygdala transition point another topic
spent many years working thinking about, testosterone
sex steroid hormones. heard say among brain areas
bind testosterone, testosterone can park create effects amygdala
among chockablock full parking spots, receptors. realize
lot here, think role testosterone amygdala
given engagement amygdala fundamental transition point
exhilarating, positive response negative stressful response? maybe
just broadly, think testosterone effects brain? -
pertinent transition whether stressor evoking fear revoking
aggression terms continuum, also amygdala center
four points axes. Basically, almost everybody completely wrong
idea testosterone does, testosterone makes aggressive
males, virtually every species testosterone aggressive
seasonal measures testosterone surging time year, punching
territory. take testosterone picture, castrate
mammal there, including us, levels aggression will go down. easy
thing tends conclude testosterone causes aggression. reality
testosterone no thing, doesn't cause aggression. can see
behaviorally amygdala. testosterone do? lowers threshold
sort things normally provoke [mumbles]
happens easily. makes systems already turned on, turn louder rather
turning aggressive music thing. look like
behaviorally? take five male monkeys, put together, form dominance


hierarchy. Number one great, number five miserable, number three right
between. Now take number three shoot guy tons testosterone
going involved fights. Aha, testosterone uniformly causes aggression,
look closely pattern it, number three now challenging numbers
two one place hierarchy. Absolutely not, brown-nosing
exactly much used to. going just miserable terror poor
number four five. case, testosterone amplifying
preexisting patterns aggression. Amplifying social learning, it'd gone
there. Now sort reductive level, translate
amygdala? testosterone make amygdaloid neurons action potentials?
cause neurons suddenly speak fear aggression spontaneously?
Absolutely not. is, amygdala already stimulated, increases
rate neuronal firing. worth? shortens after-hyperpolarizations.
theme exactly is, not creating aggression, just upping volume
whatever aggression already there. factor in, impossible say
anything testosterone

00:15:15 Behaviors Affect Testosterone

outside context testosterone related behaviors, get treated [laughs]
social settings. - Mm-hmm, yeah. terms status relationship
individuals, either nonhuman primates humans, can say testosterone
levels testosterone? say, can say relative levels
testosterone individuals correlated status within hierarchy? - Yes,
way winds totally uninteresting. Like go back whatever number
decades, endocrinology texts, two totally reliable findings there.
see, dog that's- - Oh, good, like dogs Huberman Lab
podcast. - Oh, okay, jingling that. - welcome, absolutely
welcome, yeah. - there'd two truisms, higher levels testosterone
predict higher levels aggression humans animals. Higher levels
testosterone predict higher levels sexual activity. Whoa, testosterone causing both,
correlation there. look closely, got cause effect stuff,
sexual behavior raises testosterone levels, aggression raises testosterone levels.
levels barely predictive going happen, response


rather cause. look though terms making sense individual
differences, don't matter whole lot. can spend entire career social
circumstances produce 3.5% testosterone circulation, expect see
sorts interesting implications. not really case, somewhat yes
no modulator much subtle social stuff already there. -
interesting.

00:17:20 Mindsets & Contexts Affect Testosterone

think lot misconceptions human biology, testosterone
seems one area least can find internet, sort
peak misunderstanding. Maybe just ask questions
testosterone sexual behavior interesting story
castration versus non-castration causality, again. address that,
just want highlight something said think vital,
behaviors, aggressive behaviors sexual behaviors can actually increase
testosterone. hear correctly? - Yeah. - reverse sort true, not
causal way. right? - opposite direction causality, yeah. - Yeah, yeah,
increase somebody's testosterone 30%, male female doesn't matter,
sexual behavior may may not change. - Essentially zero effect all. brain
not sensitive fluctuations testosterone levels. terms things like
aggression, raising testosterone, great footnote. right type
willing die trenches devotion sort thing, watching favorite team play
sport will raise testosterone levels sit potato chips
armchair. not physicality aggression, psychological framing it. So,
yeah, testosterone not causing that. great way appreciate is, okay,
testosterone sexual behavior correlations, definitive
endocrine intervention, subtraction study, removed testes.
said before, levels sexual behavior goes down. Good, just shown
testosterone somehow caused it. Critically go down, not zero,
whether rat monkey human, whatever. predicts much
residual sexual behavior there, much sexual behavior
castration? telling behavior carried social
learning context rather hormone, exact thing aggression.


Drops castration, doesn't go zero, prior history it, just
keeps coasting along even without testosterone. - interesting. Can
say exception terms early organizing effects hormones? Like,
instance, developing animal deprived testosterone estrogen
aromatized testosterone estrogen, whole story is, know.
imagine circuits brain responsible initiating sexual
behavior first place might not emerge, therefore not sensitive
testosterone later life. right?

00:20:28 Finger Length Ratios Reflect Prenatal Hormone Levels

Okay. - Yeah, exactly. great way seeing totally nutty biological
factoid, second fourth digit ratio enhanced. - Oh yeah. - Totally obscure
thing, ratio one way reflects levels testosterone, androgen
exposure fetal life. can't remember way goes minuscule
need thousand people sample size able see anything, see
primates, already fetal sonograms, that. readout
subtle differences prenatal exposure, winds predictor whole
range sort stuff adult behavior. So, yeah, fetal end, still
building everything, testosterone amount making huge difference.
time adult, just somewhat old non-signal. - Yeah,
confession, master's student Berkeley Marc Breedlove's
arena, author paper, although deep within author line,
got description exactly right D2, index finger ring finger
ratio similar females males. males, index finger tends
shorter. people listening now freaking
measuring, proper way measure this, is, eyeballing doesn't
work time unless extremes. interesting stories there.
actually replicated no fewer five times, Marc Breedlove tells me.
yes, terms early organizing effects, seem robust studies.
later effects sort activation neural circuits hormones.

00:22:30 Aggression: Male-Female, Female-Male, & Female-Female



absolutely fascinated this. couple questions, is,
normally associate testosterone males, course, females make testosterone
well adrenals presumably elsewhere too. guessing looked hard
enough, probably find sources androgens females. Can
say general contours effects aggression also pertain females?
suppose ask particular female-female aggression,
exist many species, female-male agregression well maternal aggression,
robust aspect evolution, course, mother will, angry mother
animal kind protecting young truly dangerous, best sense word.
- type post-parturition, period birth aggression estrogen,
progesterone, sorts things. Female aggression, rest time
testosterone major player much lower level average. average,
one always say, basically punchlines. females, lower
levels testosterone essential typical levels aggression sexual behavior.
Nonetheless, not causing it, not sensitive small individual differences.
exact thing. can get way over-impressed

00:24:05 Testosterone: Challenge Hypothesis

importance androgens females just readily males. - line
that, conceptualize testosterone? realize isn't single sentence
can capture hormone effects hormones many different
slow fast effects brain, glands own, glands
produce them. heard talk testosterone today years,
start get impression misunderstood molecule [laughs] human
health universe, clearly something powerful. shifting way
certain neural circuits work, adjusting gain amygdala, described,
certainly things well. truism testosterone like,
relationship effort relationship resilience, way maybe will help
people sort think think testosterone? - Yeah. Maybe
three separate answers that. first one is, think fair summary think
comes motivated strong behaviors, testosterone make
whatever already are. me, sexual arousal, libido, aggressiveness,
spontaneous aggression, reactive aggression, things sort. upping volume


things already strongly there. Second way think is, well, like
favorite finding testosterone. wonderful work guy,
John Wingfield, one best behavioral endocrinologists there.
20 years ago formulated called Challenge Hypothesis Testosterone
Action. testosterone do? Testosterone secrete
status challenged, makes likely behaviors
needed hold onto status. Okay, totally boringly straightforward
baboon. somebody challenging high rank, appropriate response
part going aggression. right, just got back door,
testosterone aggression, again. get humans, humans lots
different ways achieving maintaining status. need go like
fancy private school's annual auction, will see half-drunk alpha
males competing see can give money away show conspicuous
like property have. setting like that, mean, haven't able take
urine samples, times, unfortunately, shows flip side it.
species hands status different sort way, testosterone going
boost also. Okay, generates totally nutty prediction. Wow, take people
circumstance, say playing economic game get status trustworthy
generous interactions game. give people testosterone,
make generous? absolutely case. Totally cool
finding. showing you, don't know, basically took whole bunch Buddhist
monks shot testosterone, get competitive
random acts kindness. societal problem
much aggression, first culprit look not testosterone, first look
hand much damn elevated status aggression many
circumstances. find finding fantastic. Third thing subtlety
testosterone. Okay, like subtler behavioral effects, give testosterone
people become confident, become self-confident. Well,
good, people pay take sorts nonsensical self-help courses will boost
self-esteem. good thing unless testosterone makes confident,
inaccurate, likely barrel wrong decisions. shown
economic game play testosterone making confident makes less
cooperative needs cooperate top own.
Testosterone makes people cocky impulsive. might great one setting,


is, absolutely sure army get
country three days. hell, start World War I, get big surprise it.
Testosterone altering risk assessment beforehand probably played big role kind
miscalculation.

00:29:20 Dopamine Impacts Testosterone & Motivation

- Super-interesting. always think testosterone dopamine close cousins
brain, not just relationship pituitary
hypothalamus. That, course, also dopamine's salient role creating
bias towards exteroception. somebody takes drug, increases
dopamine, chockablock full dopamine. tend, want highlight 'tend'
is, really generalizing here, tend focus outward goals,
things beyond boundaries skin. testosterone seems bit
same, tends put us similar mode perceiving outside world ways
asking questions like, relate species? relate
goals? anything can better conceptualize relationship
testosterone dopamine motivation? just take us
alleyways of, neural pathways hypothalamus? fine too. - Well,
think got lots sort massive revisionism dopamine. Everyone,
since pharaohs got brought taught dopamine pleasure
reward. turns isn't, anticipation reward, generating
motivation, goal-directed behavior needed go get reward.
know it, using like elevated dopamine, entire life motivate
whatever going get like entry heaven after-life kind of, sort
thing. really motivation. testosterone even individuals
not aggressive testosterone replacement often helpful thing
aging males increases energy, increases sense thereness, presence
alertness increases motivation. whole aspect, takes us
motivation get like go, hand lots soup soup kitchen
homeless people, get go ethnically cleanse village. got much
makeup testosterone got onboard. activating
energetic sense, testosterone within minutes increases glucose uptake skeletal
muscle. just awake alert that, lot


dopamine does. one might predict then, getting just right levels
testosterone infused bloodstream feels great lab rats. will lever press
get infused range optimizes dopamine release. is,
absolutely right, deeply intertwined. - Yeah, beautiful biology there.

00:32:32 Estrogen: Improves Brain & Longevity TIMING KEY

love way encapsulate relationship. want ask estrogen,
don't hear estrogen often, always interesting now
public facing education, testosterone controversial molecule, just say
almost controversial. [laughs] [Robert laughs] estrogen doesn't seem hold
controversial weight, yet estrogen powerful effects
animal brain human brain males females. Men not want
estrogen go low. Terrible things happen, will lose cognitive function, libido
can drop. men need estrogen well, perhaps maybe can put filter
estrogen testosterone. general themes estrogen
people aware think generally misunderstood? really
feelings empathy making us sensitive? sense not. - No,
context dependent. estrogen giving birth playing central
role wanting shred face somebody getting close kittens kind
thing, know not just warm, fuzzy, empathic kind stuff. Estrogen lots
ways summarized by, got choice matter lot
estrogen bloodstream not, go lot estrogen. enhances
cognition, exactly said, stimulates neurogenesis hippocampus,
increases glucose oxygen delivery, protects dementia, decreases
inflammatory oxidative damage blood vessels, good protecting
cardiovascular disease contrast testosterone, making everyone
things worse. springs minefield question, is,
post-menopausal estrogen? sorts lab studies non-human primates
suggested keep estrogen levels high monkey's equivalent
menopause. going keep brain health lot better decreasing risk
dementia, stroke, every thing. Estrogen great antioxidant, that.
90s think Healy, forgetting name, first female
head NIH, Bernadine Healy set massive prospective human study,


going biggest one times, looking pluses minuses post-
menopausal estrogen. tens thousands women, was...
cut study short seeing was, estrogen not
normal bad stuff expect terms decalcification stuff,
increasing risk cardiovascular disease, increasing risk stroke,
increasing risk dementia. ground halt everybody,
stopped study front page news everybody panned point. nobody
make sense spending last 20 years studying exact
thing primates seeing protective effects. explanation turned
one things like law unexpected consequences. Okay,
menopause women, lasts different lengths time, may factor going
come. know what, not start giving study subjects estrogen
totally past menopause. got lag time between, shift
sorts estrogen receptor patterns, bad effects come from.
- Wow! - monkey studies involved just maintaining ovulatory levels
post-menopausal period. get great effects. Estrogen one
greatest predictors protection Alzheimer's disease, that, needs
physiological. Just keep continuing body long time
versus let whole thing shutdown suddenly like try fire coal stoves
bottom basement kind thing, get going, get utterly different
outcomes. caused lot human health consequences people suddenly
decided estrogen fact neurologically endangering post-menopausally. - Wow,
fascinating. never thought steroid hormone receptors not
binding estrogen, devoid estrogen binding, say, set off
opposite biochemical cascades. Fascinating. guess raises question
testosterone replacement too, whether not people [laughs] talk doctor
long. Men women talk physicians long avoid these,
whatever happening periods isn't sufficient testosterone and/or
estrogen. sounds like cause longer-term problems even therapies
introduced. - Two additional misery slash complications. So, okay, trying
understand, look women history without post-menopausal estrogen
replacement done great. seeing 20 years later, estrogen
predictor decreased risk Alzheimer's. got start trying
unpacking prospective type studies. much estrogen? times? Estrogen


catchall term bunch hormones, estrone, estradiol, estriol. much one
them? Natural synthetic? Go try figure out. second
complication is, often hard say anything estrogen outside
context progesterone doing. often not absolute levels either,
ratio two. complicated endocrine system
testosterone. generate dramatic cyclicity like no male
hypothalamus ever dream off. much, much complicated system, thus,
lot complicated understand,

00:39:40 Testosterone & Sperm Counts Males Really Dropping?

let alone like figure ideal benefits it. - Yeah. don't know
make literature dropping rates testosterone endocrine disruptors.
Berkeley Tyrone Hayes published data frogs drinking
water various locations throughout United States, not just California,
seeing severe endocrine disruption blockade or, androgen receptors
sorts issues. hear time now sperm counts
dropping, endocrine disruptors birth control
water, drinking water. starts sound little crazy, yet also
fooled by, guess good example be, lot crazy stuff
world online terrible stuff highly processed foods. yet got
respectable people, endocrinologists UCSF like Robert Lustig saying, yeah, lot
hidden sugars emulsifiers, causing real problems.
become open-minded question. so, suffering drops
sperm counts testosterone estrogen fertility consequence endocrine
disruptors environments food, social reasons? anything
can hang hat like real data confident in? just mess? -
No, phenomenon appear quite real. Cross-sectional studies, human
populations, still don't understand one first things Hayes
spotted. Decreasing testicle size crocodiles. [Andrew laughs] Go figure
one first contributions this. think phenomenon absolutely real.
left two classic challenges, correlated
something broad environmental toxins. ones, much, when, etc.?
one always being, well, okay, dropping dropping enough make difference.


big effect this? juries still out. - Yeah,
area know lot interest in, got groups people won't
touch receipt store BPAs inks the...
[laughs] got people don't care things. fascinating area.

00:42:15 Stress Mitigation & Sense Control

hope biology will done soon. like briefly return stress.
described study two rats, one running wheel voluntarily, one
basically stuck running wheel, forced run anytime, rat number one runs.
one case rat voluntarily exercising. [laughs] case, rat
forced go PE class, speak, really, seeing divergent effects
biology. like just touch use kind case study stress
mitigation general. rather obsessed colleague, David Spiegel, Associate
Chair Psychiatry Stanford obsessed question of, humans can start
mitigate stress? think stress mitigation
individuals families culture try encourage people
mitigate stress, ways not going turn us rat number two,
forced mitigate stress therefore becomes stressful.
[laughs] - see is, rat number one gets benefits exercise. Rat
number two gets downsides severe stress exact muscle
expenditure movements going on. Perfectly yoked, great example
interpretation head. haven't kept literature, bet you, rat
number two whole lot activity amygdala rat number one.
Okay, stress mitigation. Anything say preface with,
reasonably good telling people going happen don't manage
stress, terrible actually like managing stress advising manage that.
much better bad news aspect it. see is, now just classic
literature, half century old, sort showing building blocks stress. Not,
ooh, step outside gored elephant, can grow
experience? doesn't kill makes stronger.
stress response, realm gray zone ambiguous social
interactions, sort thing. people massive stress responses, others not
all, between, enjoy it. Like building blocks of, makes


psychological stress stressful? first one exactly brought
running study. sense control? sense control makes stressors less
stressful. running wheel shows studies you, lab rat
college freshman volunteer trained pressing lever, less likely
get shock. today lever working away unbeknownst
lever turned off, no effect shock frequency,
think control, less stress response. rat
day-in day-out, less likely get ulcer. sense
control. related sense predictability. Rat get shocked, human gets
shocked, whatever, scenario either shocks come now then,
shocks come now then, 10 seconds little warning light comes on.
get warning light, shocks distressful. got predictability
not getting warning lights, second half second away
next shock. get warning light, know isn't one, got
least 10 seconds worth relaxation. know coming, can prepare
coping responses, best afterward know finally safe,
can recover it. enormously protective. Others outlet frustration,
take rat getting shocked, run running wheel,
protective thing, voluntarily. got rat can gnaw bar
wood, stressor less stressful. Unfortunately, rat primate human
stressed, ability aggressively dump somebody smaller weaker
also reduces stress response. fact displacement aggression reduces
stress accounts huge percent triggers like unhappiness.
variables, get social support well. good one. Interpreting circumstances
good news rather bad. Hurray, got simple sort like take
home recipe go get much control much predictability many
outlets much social support possible, going just fine.
go that, recipe total disaster much, much
subtle that. one great example, okay, getting shocks, want
warning beforehand, get little warning light 10 seconds shock,
wonderfully protective. Get warning light one second shock doesn't
anything. not enough time get psychological benefits
anticipation. Now instead, gets little warning coming two minutes
shock, going make things worse not going sitting


like reveling sort sense predictability, soon going be, oh.
going sitting two minutes saying, damn, comes. Predictive
information works narrow domain. Similarly, control. want
sense control face stress? answer is, mild moderate
stressor happening then, sense control completely
independent reality whether control not, face mild
moderate stressors, sense control gets interpreted as, wow, look much worse
things been. Thank God, control, top master fate.
contrast, major stressor, arbitrary sense control make
think, oh God, look much better been. prevented it.
know intuitively like face people's worst stressors.
Nobody stopped car way kids suddenly jumped out. wouldn't
mattered gotten doctor month ago, instead now,
wouldn't made any... didn't actually control. see is,
absolutely want huge sense control mild moderate stressors,
especially ones result good outcome. Hooray, me, face horrible
stressors, want like self-deception, like truth beauty don't
necessarily go hand-in-hand point. stress management techniques
impact control predictability wind far worse neutral preaching
somebody homeless somebody terminal cancer, somebody
refugee. Tell neurotic middle-class person psychological tools
turn hell heaven. truth that. thing somebody
going real hell, just privileged heartlessness
doesn't work. outlets, outlets damaging,
not good way mitigate stress. Social support, confusing mere
acquaintances real social support, going rug pulled
point. mistaking social support being, going bitching
moaning demanding supportiveness everyone around rather
reciprocally, not going work well either. not simple.
not nothing lots us really lousy. It, like good friends things
like that, takes lot work right? wrong may
temporarily seem like great thing, turns completely misplaced
faith, going feeling worse started.



00:51:35 Best Buffer Stress

- Interesting. days, lot interest using physical practices mitigate
stress, trying get ruminating, extent take control neural
circuits brain using exercise using breathing hypnosis. And, course,
hypnosis mental component well. thoughts stress mitigation
standpoint of, okay, don't want rat number two, want select
something ourselves, take initiative ourselves. forced
exercising not, actually negative health effect perhaps. need
pick something like, need take control it. terms supporting
people, touched bit. best way support people?
talk stressful thing? mean, not asking play psychologist here,
find divergent data this. can spin lather ruminating
something. language seems like wonderful tool, also fairly
deprived tool doesn't really get core physiology like something
like breathing would. thoughts more, lack better way put
it, head-centered, cognitive approaches stress mitigation versus kind going
core physiology. Cold showers now even thing extent just get
people stress acclimated, voluntarily taking cold showers. - makes sense
physiologically, preconditioning real stressors come. terms
bring up, oh, transcendental meditation, mindfulness, exercise, prayer, sort reflecting
gratitude, sort thing. Collectively work average, work
terms of, can lower heart rate cholesterol levels sorts good
outcomes, compromise us. One exactly caveat comes
running wheel study is, doesn't matter many friends swear stress
management technique. makes want scream head off 10
seconds, not one going work you. read fine print
testimonials, got something works you. Another one stress
management type techniques work, can't save weekend, can't
save stuck hold phone Muzak two minutes.
got something stop virtually, daily every
day, spend 20, 30 minutes it. see coming
like 80/20 rule economics. 80/20, 80% complaints store come
20% customers, things like that. see is, entire life consists


every single thing shoulders, can't say no 24/7. stopped
finally said, wellbeing important enough finally get say no
stuff can't say no to. going every day 20 minutes,
whatever stress management technique 20 minutes sort
knows what, already 80% way simply decided
wellbeing important enough going stop every single day
priority. exactly finding find people chronic
depression untreated merely calling getting appointment see mental
health professional, people start feeling better already evidence
activated, matter enough this, conceive
actually good outcome rather hopeless one. Just something
meditative reflective every day so, hardly even matters one
doing. comes thus another warning, not trust anybody
says, scientifically proven brand stress management works
better ones. Just watch wallet point. - Yeah, amen. think one
core goals lab David Spiegel's lab, know worked
David published papers David well really try find
various entry points thing call autonomic nervous system
stress system, systems gone unchecked really can take us
dark path. idea many entry points really one keeps,
data keep telling us again. no magic breathing tool
exercise, variety one those. And, again, come back idea
one select one make space for, one
hopefully enjoy going work best terms physiology. - [mumbles]
benign people stuck around you.

00:57:04 Power Perception, Choice & Individual Differences

- Right, right, absolutely. brings question of, find amazing
perceive event, whether not chose event not can
incredible different effects circuitry brain circuitry body
biology cells. ways boggles mind, like can decision made
presumably prefrontal cortex, although parts brain well, can
change essentially polarity response body. And, mean, talked


Type personalities there. don't go detail
sake time, interesting effects endothelial cells. mean, literally
size of, [laughs] portals blood opposite direction, depending
whether not somebody wants situation highly motivated person. Maybe
just give us top contour think really illustrates
principle beautifully. maybe would, just speculate
brain might switch turn one experience terrible beneficial
beneficial terrible, really fascinating. - Well, need like tonight
going sleep lying bed nice drowsy
heart's beating nice slow, start thinking fact heart isn't going
beat forever. [Andrew laughs] imagine toes getting cold afterward
imagine flow blood coming halt clotting. going
something physiology point 99% mammals
running frantically. going turning sympathetic
stress response thought, emotions, memory. measure
just much cortex limbic system sends projections
autonomic regulators brain. can think autonomic regulatory neurons
action ways animals can like extremes environmental
circumstances. given autonomic rule, mean, big challenge
understanding gigantic individual differences. that's, talk
optimal amount stress, counts stimulation, general stress not
severe doesn't go long overall benevolence setting.
conditions, love stressed something unexpected
control predictability like really interesting plot turn movie watching.
great, get individual differences somehow accommodate
fact people, perfect stimulatory amount stress like getting
early Audubon birdwatching walk next Sunday morning. somebody else,
signing like mercenary Yemen. [Andrew laughs]

01:00:32 Context-Setting, Prefrontal Cortex & Hierarchy

tremendous individual differences swamp simple prescriptions. - Yeah,
prefrontal cortex, thinking machinery harbor, double-edged
sword. remarkable is, areas brain like hypothalamus


amygdala, sort like switches. mean, context gain
control. talked gain control testosterone, etc., really like
switches. mean, stimulate ventromedial hypothalamus, get right neurons,
animal will try kill even object sitting next it. tickle
neurons, it'll try mate object. mean, really wild. think
probably rules prefrontal cortex also, sounds like context plural
prefrontal cortex can draw probably infinite, probably learn
perceive threat anything. Whether not another group whether not
science whether not somebody's version shape earth versus
another. mean, like, can plug anything system give enough data,
think sounds like drive fear response love response.
overstepping? - [laughs] mixed horribly ambivalent one changing
millisecond, like mutually contradictory. No, absolutely case
prefrontal cortex, regretted like wasted 30 years
life studying hippocampus shoot studied prefrontal cortex
much interesting does, contextual stuff.
ways not okay lie setting, great thing another.
not okay kill unless them, get medal. not,
social context moral relativity situational ethic stuff, prefrontal cortex
got master that. winds meaning place brain
anywhere say perception things can powerfully influence
reality coming you. - Yeah. - mean, great example, just harking back
testosterone. Okay, exercise boosts testosterone levels. exercise
success exercise failure? literature back 80s looking
outcomes marathons. testosterone rise people win
losers? Wrestling matches. Things sort simple prediction answer
wound being, didn't see simple answer. Okay, win marathon, not
necessarily predictor increased testosterone. about? find
like winner testosterone decreases, find guy came 73rd
massive testosterone increase. Whoa, about?
far human subtlety. guy won race decline testosterone
came three minutes later really, really expecting.
everybody now going writing hill. guy
came 73rd boost testosterone assuming dead


heart attack third mile, [Andrew laughs] instead managed finish.
interpretive stuff going there, prefrontal cortex about. -
Amazing, raises question cognitive flexibility, Can tell
something good us even not enjoying it? can wriggle around
corners choosing exercise the... Personally not big fan long bouts
meditation, benefited tremendously things like dedicated breathing
shorter rounds meditation. Can tell good wriggle around
corner get physiology working way want? cognitive
flexibility? Can third place runner tell myself, well, least came in,
wanted win badly. primary goal, another goal beat
previous time, that. so, [laughs] mean, it's... extent can
toggle relationship prefrontal cortex primitive
systems? - Well, enormous amount. example, low hierarchy
generally bad health like every mammal there, including us,
something special, can part multiple hierarchies time.
maybe low ranking one them, extremely high ranking
another, like crappiest job corporation, captain
softball team year company. better bet somebody
going find sorts ways decide nine five Monday Fridays, just stupid
paying bills. really matters prestige weekend. poorer,
deacon church here. can play sorts psychological
games that. One like consistent, reliable ones need
use frontal cortex like crazy is, somebody something rotten need
attribute it. answer is, something wrong, hmm, rotten.
Always always will constitutional explanation. something
rotten somebody, explain afterward? situational one. tired,
stressed sort setting, misunderstood this. best excusing
bad things access inner lives got
prefrontal cortexes great coming situational explanation rather than,
hey, maybe just like selfish rotten human, need change.
prefrontal cortex, every time, don't let somebody merge lane
front us, even though curse somebody thing and...
Endlessly. - love it. statement fact can select multiple
hierarchies participate in. seems like particularly important one nowadays


social media prevalent. know not particularly active social
media although might pleasantly, don't know unpleasantly surprised find
lot positive discussion work, don't even
need there. just continue discuss [laughs] work.
interesting social media found context very, broad. mean,
one argue one selects follow news articles reading,
etc. can create kind funneling information can dangerous.
verification crazy ideas even just less exposure new ideas. also
idea social media incredibly broad context. scroll feed,
no longer like eighth grade classroom office faculty
meeting. exposed thousands, not millions contexts, meal,
soccer game, person's body, person's intellect. YouTube another example.
vast, vast landscape. context completely mishmash whereas assuming
evolved. think evolve contexts much constrained.
interacted limited number individuals limited number different domains,
seasons tended constrain us all. course, got phones televisions,
started expand, now ever, brain, prefrontal cortex
sense exist multiple hierarchies essentially wicked
infinity. think might interacting primitive
systems aspects biology? - Well, think get is, ways
punchline of, human humans, use
exact blueprint, hormones, kinases, receptors,
same, everything built exact stuff species
there, go use completely novel way. usually terms
able abstract stuff space time dramatic ways. So, okay, low
ranking baboon can feel badly just like killed rabbit
eat higher ranking guy boots off takes away you,
feel crummy stressful unhappy. exact
things like brain bodies losing sense self-esteem,
can watching movie character screen feeling inadequate compared
like wonderful attractive are. can somebody driving past us
expensive car, don't even see face, can feel belittled
socioeconomic status. can watch like Lifestyles Rich Famous
read Bezos to. reason, decide life less fulfilling


didn't fly space 11 minutes. can feel miserable
ways no organism can, simply can
meaningful social networks include like party reading Facebook
weren't invited taking place Singapore, don't know
people, nonetheless, somehow means

01:11:20 Dr. Sapolsky Accomplishes Deep Thinking

feel less content turned be. take steps life
actively restrict contexts think live contemplate order
enhance creative life, intellectual life? steps actively take? -
Well, actively don't know make use anything [laughs] social media.
guess counts thus actively chosen not learn how.
case certainly last year half, like lots people, gone stretches
managed sort enforce moratorium looking news,
wonderfully freeing. think larger sense though, addition
neurobiologist, sort spent decades spending part year studying wild
baboons national park East Africa. spend three months year without
electricity, without phone calls, going 12 hours day without saying word
somebody. finally would, somebody nomadic pastoralist guy
different language. Yeah, 90% like insightful thinking anything
laboratory three months year, not one lab, not
inundated stuff. - Well, think shifting trend towards trying create
narrowing context that... like see, niece, 14-years-old
friends good putting phones away. say, not
going phones interaction, especially after... realized still
somewhat this. unclear headed,

01:13:17 Free Will?

2020 restrictive separated friends. Now it's,
really focus together not bring elements phones.
brings great hope generation, [laughs] maybe will...
knows, maybe run off study baboons, need field researchers.


along lines choice, like shift gears slightly talk freewill,
ability make choices all. - Well, personal way left field inflammatory
stance is, don't think shred freewill despite 95% philosophers.
think probably majority neuroscientists saying freewill least
circumstances. don't think all. reason is,
something, behave, make choice, whatever. understand
that, intention come from? Part due like sensory
environment previous minute. hormone levels
bloodstream morning. whether wonderful
stressful last three months sort neuroplasticity happened. Part
hormone levels exposed fetus. Part culture ancestors
came with, thus parented kid.
there, can understand behavior coming without incorporating
those. point, not relevant factors,
ultimately one factor. talking evolution
behavior, definition also talking genetics. talking
genes behavior, definition talking brain
constructed proteins coded for. talking like mood
disorder now, talking sense efficacy getting five-year-
old. intertwined. look influences, basically like
challenge is, show neuron just caused behavior, show network
neurons just caused behavior. show nothing just
influenced anything sensory environment one second ago
evolution species. no space fit freewill concept
winds brain, not brain. simply no wiggle room
there. - can appreciate behaviors choices consequences
long line dominoes fell prior behavior. possible can
intervene domino effect, speak. words, can recognition
fact genes heritability, epigenome that, hormonal context,
historical context. Can knowledge give small shard
freewill? Meaning, allow say, ah, okay, accept choices
somewhat predetermined, yet knowing gives additional layer
control? philosophical biological universe works? - Nah.
can produce wonderfully positive belief change can happen. Even


traumatic change, even worst circumstances, unlikely people, change
can happen, things can change. Don't fatalistic, don't decide
mechanistic, biological machines nothing can ever... Change can happen,
people go off rails translating into, can change ourselves. don't,
can't no freewill. However, can changed circumstance.
point is, like look Aplysia, sea slug learned retract gill
response shock tail, can like conditioning, Pavlovian conditioning
it, learned, behavior changed environment. hear
news something like horrifically depressing going on, refugees wherever.
result, feel little bit helpless less sense efficacy
world, behaviors changed. Okay, okay, yeah, guess that,
remarkable thing is, exact neurobiology. signal transduction
pathways happening sea snail incorporate exact kinases
proteases phosphatases mammalian fear
conditioning, alert, conserved. exact thing, simply
playing obviously much, much fancier domain. learned
change possible despite understanding mechanistically can't change
volitionally, understand change possible, just
changed ability brain respond optimistic stimuli. changed
ability brain now send direction exposed
information will seem cheerful rather depressing. Oh God, amazing,
Nelson Mandela Martin Luther king folks did. Wow,
adverse circumstances, able do. Maybe can also, maybe can go
read people like get even data points change
neurochemistry, responses different now. tilted little bit
direction feeling like can make difference instead damn
hopeless. enormous change can happen, last thing come
view of, nothing less sum biology interactions
environment,

01:20:50 Apply Knowledge & Learning

throw hands say, thus no use trying change anything. -
can acknowledge change extremely hard impossible, circumstances


can change, yet striving better human beings still worthwhile
endeavor. correct? - Absolutely. simply knowledge, either
experience making end right neurobiology class taught
change can happen within framework mechanistic neurobiology.
now open made optimistic good news world around you.
likely inspired that, resistant getting
discouraged bad news, simply now understand possible. - Mm-hmm,
yeah, somebody spent much career working hippocampus,
assume believer neuroplasticity, neural circuits can change
response experience, so-called top-down mechanisms
prefrontal cortex talking can play role there,
decision try change pursuit knowledge pursuit experience
can shape circuitry, therefore make us different machines, speak. - Yeah.
not can say prenatal hormone exposure changed way brain
constructed, learning prenatal hormone exposure can change construction
brain will change brain right now, think
intentions came from. Wow, maybe something it. knowledge
knowledge effector itself. - important powerful
statement hear. think many people think tool, doesn't involve pill
protocol, useless. certainly pills protocols
useful variety context variety things, idea knowledge itself,
whereas put it, knowledge knowledge tool, think important
concept people embed minds. And, listen, grateful discussion
raising topics. think people, many people know work
testosterone, stress, covered today, work freewill
idea hopeless total control. think realizing
listening neither true, solution resides

01:23:44 Robert’s New Book: “Determined: Science Life Without Free Will”

understanding freewill lack it, [laughs] also neuroplasticity.
working book freewill, willing tell us little bit
book process can look forward to? - Yeah,
going really slow. Title is, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill."


essentially first half book trying convince reader, okay, not
no freewill whatsoever, least lot less normally assumed.
going standard arguments freewill, doesn't make sense
21st century science? led reading lot frustrating
philosophers basically willing admit stuff made like atoms
molecules. like physical reality sort world, not just relying
magic, believe freewill magical reasons, doesn't make
sense. Okay, first half book hopefully convince people
much less freewill used think. second half gigantic
juncture built around fact haven't thought freewill since like
adolescent. despite thinking way, still absolutely no idea
supposed function belief. supposed go everyday life
anything feel entitled isn't true? angers hatreds feel aren't justified,
no thing appropriate, blame punishment praise reward,
none makes sense, somebody like even compliments haircut,
conditioned say, oh, thanks, something do.
supposed function that? second half wrestling that,
punchline is, going incredibly hard. think going
hard subtract notion freewill making sense like serial murderers,
going thousand times harder making sense somebody says "good job"
you. [Andrew laughs] exact reality sort
interpretations. going incredibly hard, nonetheless look
history subtracted notion agency sorts realms
blame, starting thinking witches caused hailstorms 500 years ago notion
psychodynamically screwed mothers cause schizophrenia, done it.
done endless number times, able subtract sense volition
understanding world works around us. don't murderers running
amuck street, society hasn't collapsed puddle, fact,
humane society. good news possible done repeatedly
past, going hard hell. hard hell try write
coherently, [laughs] discovering, going slowly. - Well, speak many, many
people say really excited book done will
patiently wait, great excitement book, "Determined". said title,
correct? - Yeah, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill". seems like


can't publish book days without sub-title, it? - Fantastic. Well,
excited read book. grateful conversation today, learned
ton. Every time speak learn, really pleasure delight
interact today previous years, say, colleagues.
thank again, Robert, everything hard, hard work
thinking put work clear put lot hard work

commonly is, difference short long-term stress terms
benefits drawbacks? reason say benefits that, obviously stress
stress response can keep us alive, stress, course, can also sharpen
mental acuity things sort. conceptualize stress
conceptualize stress short-term long-term? - Well, basically
sort two graphs one draw. first one just sorts beneficial effects
stress short-term, get chronicity, just downhill there.
Short-term saves predator, short-term giving
presentation think clearly focus better, sorts aspects
that. winds argument is, long take go
short-term long-term? somewhat arbitrary, sorts chronic stressors
people deal just undeniably chronic range, like spent
last 20 years, daily traffic jams abusive boss thing. curve
sort perpendicular dealing fact sometimes stress great
thing. Like goal not cure people stress right kind, love it.
pay good money stressed way scary movie rollercoaster ride.
wind seeing right amount stress, call
stimulation. basic curve is, optimal level stimulation
little, function goes call boredom, much
function goes

00:09:11 Valence & Amygdala

call stress. optimum us aim for. - terms
benefits stress short-term, one thing really striking is,
physiologically stress response looks much like excitement response
positive event. can speculate fundamental difference short-
term stress short-term excitement neuromodulator like dopamine
something like that. anything else know biology
reveals us? really creates thing call valence experience can
terrible feel awful, can feel wonderful, exhilarating depending somewhat
subjective feature call valence? know valence resides? -
really mechanical level, circumstance requiring heart
races breathing fast using muscles thing,


going roughly brain activation profile, whether
something wonderful something terrible one exception
amygdala part activation, something going counting
adverse. Whether circumstance, adverse circumstance recruiting
amygdala it, much amygdala involved, biases towards
interpreting even awful.

00:11:00 Testosterone: Common Myths vs. Actual Truths

amygdala ways kind checkpoint whether talking
excitement terror. - use amygdala transition point another topic
spent many years working thinking about, testosterone
sex steroid hormones. heard say among brain areas
bind testosterone, testosterone can park create effects amygdala
among chockablock full parking spots, receptors. realize
lot here, think role testosterone amygdala
given engagement amygdala fundamental transition point
exhilarating, positive response negative stressful response? maybe
just broadly, think testosterone effects brain? -
pertinent transition whether stressor evoking fear revoking
aggression terms continuum, also amygdala center
four points axes. Basically, almost everybody completely wrong
idea testosterone does, testosterone makes aggressive
males, virtually every species testosterone aggressive
seasonal measures testosterone surging time year, punching
territory. take testosterone picture, castrate
mammal there, including us, levels aggression will go down. easy
thing tends conclude testosterone causes aggression. reality
testosterone no thing, doesn't cause aggression. can see
behaviorally amygdala. testosterone do? lowers threshold
sort things normally provoke [mumbles]
happens easily. makes systems already turned on, turn louder rather
turning aggressive music thing. look like
behaviorally? take five male monkeys, put together, form dominance


hierarchy. Number one great, number five miserable, number three right
between. Now take number three shoot guy tons testosterone
going involved fights. Aha, testosterone uniformly causes aggression,
look closely pattern it, number three now challenging numbers
two one place hierarchy. Absolutely not, brown-nosing
exactly much used to. going just miserable terror poor
number four five. case, testosterone amplifying
preexisting patterns aggression. Amplifying social learning, it'd gone
there. Now sort reductive level, translate
amygdala? testosterone make amygdaloid neurons action potentials?
cause neurons suddenly speak fear aggression spontaneously?
Absolutely not. is, amygdala already stimulated, increases
rate neuronal firing. worth? shortens after-hyperpolarizations.
theme exactly is, not creating aggression, just upping volume
whatever aggression already there. factor in, impossible say
anything testosterone

00:15:15 Behaviors Affect Testosterone

outside context testosterone related behaviors, get treated [laughs]
social settings. - Mm-hmm, yeah. terms status relationship
individuals, either nonhuman primates humans, can say testosterone
levels testosterone? say, can say relative levels
testosterone individuals correlated status within hierarchy? - Yes,
way winds totally uninteresting. Like go back whatever number
decades, endocrinology texts, two totally reliable findings there.
see, dog that's- - Oh, good, like dogs Huberman Lab
podcast. - Oh, okay, jingling that. - welcome, absolutely
welcome, yeah. - there'd two truisms, higher levels testosterone
predict higher levels aggression humans animals. Higher levels
testosterone predict higher levels sexual activity. Whoa, testosterone causing both,
correlation there. look closely, got cause effect stuff,
sexual behavior raises testosterone levels, aggression raises testosterone levels.
levels barely predictive going happen, response


rather cause. look though terms making sense individual
differences, don't matter whole lot. can spend entire career social
circumstances produce 3.5% testosterone circulation, expect see
sorts interesting implications. not really case, somewhat yes
no modulator much subtle social stuff already there. -
interesting.

00:17:20 Mindsets & Contexts Affect Testosterone

think lot misconceptions human biology, testosterone
seems one area least can find internet, sort
peak misunderstanding. Maybe just ask questions
testosterone sexual behavior interesting story
castration versus non-castration causality, again. address that,
just want highlight something said think vital,
behaviors, aggressive behaviors sexual behaviors can actually increase
testosterone. hear correctly? - Yeah. - reverse sort true, not
causal way. right? - opposite direction causality, yeah. - Yeah, yeah,
increase somebody's testosterone 30%, male female doesn't matter,
sexual behavior may may not change. - Essentially zero effect all. brain
not sensitive fluctuations testosterone levels. terms things like
aggression, raising testosterone, great footnote. right type
willing die trenches devotion sort thing, watching favorite team play
sport will raise testosterone levels sit potato chips
armchair. not physicality aggression, psychological framing it. So,
yeah, testosterone not causing that. great way appreciate is, okay,
testosterone sexual behavior correlations, definitive
endocrine intervention, subtraction study, removed testes.
said before, levels sexual behavior goes down. Good, just shown
testosterone somehow caused it. Critically go down, not zero,
whether rat monkey human, whatever. predicts much
residual sexual behavior there, much sexual behavior
castration? telling behavior carried social
learning context rather hormone, exact thing aggression.


Drops castration, doesn't go zero, prior history it, just
keeps coasting along even without testosterone. - interesting. Can
say exception terms early organizing effects hormones? Like,
instance, developing animal deprived testosterone estrogen
aromatized testosterone estrogen, whole story is, know.
imagine circuits brain responsible initiating sexual
behavior first place might not emerge, therefore not sensitive
testosterone later life. right?

00:20:28 Finger Length Ratios Reflect Prenatal Hormone Levels

Okay. - Yeah, exactly. great way seeing totally nutty biological
factoid, second fourth digit ratio enhanced. - Oh yeah. - Totally obscure
thing, ratio one way reflects levels testosterone, androgen
exposure fetal life. can't remember way goes minuscule
need thousand people sample size able see anything, see
primates, already fetal sonograms, that. readout
subtle differences prenatal exposure, winds predictor whole
range sort stuff adult behavior. So, yeah, fetal end, still
building everything, testosterone amount making huge difference.
time adult, just somewhat old non-signal. - Yeah,
confession, master's student Berkeley Marc Breedlove's
arena, author paper, although deep within author line,
got description exactly right D2, index finger ring finger
ratio similar females males. males, index finger tends
shorter. people listening now freaking
measuring, proper way measure this, is, eyeballing doesn't
work time unless extremes. interesting stories there.
actually replicated no fewer five times, Marc Breedlove tells me.
yes, terms early organizing effects, seem robust studies.
later effects sort activation neural circuits hormones.

00:22:30 Aggression: Male-Female, Female-Male, & Female-Female



absolutely fascinated this. couple questions, is,
normally associate testosterone males, course, females make testosterone
well adrenals presumably elsewhere too. guessing looked hard
enough, probably find sources androgens females. Can
say general contours effects aggression also pertain females?
suppose ask particular female-female aggression,
exist many species, female-male agregression well maternal aggression,
robust aspect evolution, course, mother will, angry mother
animal kind protecting young truly dangerous, best sense word.
- type post-parturition, period birth aggression estrogen,
progesterone, sorts things. Female aggression, rest time
testosterone major player much lower level average. average,
one always say, basically punchlines. females, lower
levels testosterone essential typical levels aggression sexual behavior.
Nonetheless, not causing it, not sensitive small individual differences.
exact thing. can get way over-impressed

00:24:05 Testosterone: Challenge Hypothesis

importance androgens females just readily males. - line
that, conceptualize testosterone? realize isn't single sentence
can capture hormone effects hormones many different
slow fast effects brain, glands own, glands
produce them. heard talk testosterone today years,
start get impression misunderstood molecule [laughs] human
health universe, clearly something powerful. shifting way
certain neural circuits work, adjusting gain amygdala, described,
certainly things well. truism testosterone like,
relationship effort relationship resilience, way maybe will help
people sort think think testosterone? - Yeah. Maybe
three separate answers that. first one is, think fair summary think
comes motivated strong behaviors, testosterone make
whatever already are. me, sexual arousal, libido, aggressiveness,
spontaneous aggression, reactive aggression, things sort. upping volume


things already strongly there. Second way think is, well, like
favorite finding testosterone. wonderful work guy,
John Wingfield, one best behavioral endocrinologists there.
20 years ago formulated called Challenge Hypothesis Testosterone
Action. testosterone do? Testosterone secrete
status challenged, makes likely behaviors
needed hold onto status. Okay, totally boringly straightforward
baboon. somebody challenging high rank, appropriate response
part going aggression. right, just got back door,
testosterone aggression, again. get humans, humans lots
different ways achieving maintaining status. need go like
fancy private school's annual auction, will see half-drunk alpha
males competing see can give money away show conspicuous
like property have. setting like that, mean, haven't able take
urine samples, times, unfortunately, shows flip side it.
species hands status different sort way, testosterone going
boost also. Okay, generates totally nutty prediction. Wow, take people
circumstance, say playing economic game get status trustworthy
generous interactions game. give people testosterone,
make generous? absolutely case. Totally cool
finding. showing you, don't know, basically took whole bunch Buddhist
monks shot testosterone, get competitive
random acts kindness. societal problem
much aggression, first culprit look not testosterone, first look
hand much damn elevated status aggression many
circumstances. find finding fantastic. Third thing subtlety
testosterone. Okay, like subtler behavioral effects, give testosterone
people become confident, become self-confident. Well,
good, people pay take sorts nonsensical self-help courses will boost
self-esteem. good thing unless testosterone makes confident,
inaccurate, likely barrel wrong decisions. shown
economic game play testosterone making confident makes less
cooperative needs cooperate top own.
Testosterone makes people cocky impulsive. might great one setting,


is, absolutely sure army get
country three days. hell, start World War I, get big surprise it.
Testosterone altering risk assessment beforehand probably played big role kind
miscalculation.

00:29:20 Dopamine Impacts Testosterone & Motivation

- Super-interesting. always think testosterone dopamine close cousins
brain, not just relationship pituitary
hypothalamus. That, course, also dopamine's salient role creating
bias towards exteroception. somebody takes drug, increases
dopamine, chockablock full dopamine. tend, want highlight 'tend'
is, really generalizing here, tend focus outward goals,
things beyond boundaries skin. testosterone seems bit
same, tends put us similar mode perceiving outside world ways
asking questions like, relate species? relate
goals? anything can better conceptualize relationship
testosterone dopamine motivation? just take us
alleyways of, neural pathways hypothalamus? fine too. - Well,
think got lots sort massive revisionism dopamine. Everyone,
since pharaohs got brought taught dopamine pleasure
reward. turns isn't, anticipation reward, generating
motivation, goal-directed behavior needed go get reward.
know it, using like elevated dopamine, entire life motivate
whatever going get like entry heaven after-life kind of, sort
thing. really motivation. testosterone even individuals
not aggressive testosterone replacement often helpful thing
aging males increases energy, increases sense thereness, presence
alertness increases motivation. whole aspect, takes us
motivation get like go, hand lots soup soup kitchen
homeless people, get go ethnically cleanse village. got much
makeup testosterone got onboard. activating
energetic sense, testosterone within minutes increases glucose uptake skeletal
muscle. just awake alert that, lot


dopamine does. one might predict then, getting just right levels
testosterone infused bloodstream feels great lab rats. will lever press
get infused range optimizes dopamine release. is,
absolutely right, deeply intertwined. - Yeah, beautiful biology there.

00:32:32 Estrogen: Improves Brain & Longevity TIMING KEY

love way encapsulate relationship. want ask estrogen,
don't hear estrogen often, always interesting now
public facing education, testosterone controversial molecule, just say
almost controversial. [laughs] [Robert laughs] estrogen doesn't seem hold
controversial weight, yet estrogen powerful effects
animal brain human brain males females. Men not want
estrogen go low. Terrible things happen, will lose cognitive function, libido
can drop. men need estrogen well, perhaps maybe can put filter
estrogen testosterone. general themes estrogen
people aware think generally misunderstood? really
feelings empathy making us sensitive? sense not. - No,
context dependent. estrogen giving birth playing central
role wanting shred face somebody getting close kittens kind
thing, know not just warm, fuzzy, empathic kind stuff. Estrogen lots
ways summarized by, got choice matter lot
estrogen bloodstream not, go lot estrogen. enhances
cognition, exactly said, stimulates neurogenesis hippocampus,
increases glucose oxygen delivery, protects dementia, decreases
inflammatory oxidative damage blood vessels, good protecting
cardiovascular disease contrast testosterone, making everyone
things worse. springs minefield question, is,
post-menopausal estrogen? sorts lab studies non-human primates
suggested keep estrogen levels high monkey's equivalent
menopause. going keep brain health lot better decreasing risk
dementia, stroke, every thing. Estrogen great antioxidant, that.
90s think Healy, forgetting name, first female
head NIH, Bernadine Healy set massive prospective human study,


going biggest one times, looking pluses minuses post-
menopausal estrogen. tens thousands women, was...
cut study short seeing was, estrogen not
normal bad stuff expect terms decalcification stuff,
increasing risk cardiovascular disease, increasing risk stroke,
increasing risk dementia. ground halt everybody,
stopped study front page news everybody panned point. nobody
make sense spending last 20 years studying exact
thing primates seeing protective effects. explanation turned
one things like law unexpected consequences. Okay,
menopause women, lasts different lengths time, may factor going
come. know what, not start giving study subjects estrogen
totally past menopause. got lag time between, shift
sorts estrogen receptor patterns, bad effects come from.
- Wow! - monkey studies involved just maintaining ovulatory levels
post-menopausal period. get great effects. Estrogen one
greatest predictors protection Alzheimer's disease, that, needs
physiological. Just keep continuing body long time
versus let whole thing shutdown suddenly like try fire coal stoves
bottom basement kind thing, get going, get utterly different
outcomes. caused lot human health consequences people suddenly
decided estrogen fact neurologically endangering post-menopausally. - Wow,
fascinating. never thought steroid hormone receptors not
binding estrogen, devoid estrogen binding, say, set off
opposite biochemical cascades. Fascinating. guess raises question
testosterone replacement too, whether not people [laughs] talk doctor
long. Men women talk physicians long avoid these,
whatever happening periods isn't sufficient testosterone and/or
estrogen. sounds like cause longer-term problems even therapies
introduced. - Two additional misery slash complications. So, okay, trying
understand, look women history without post-menopausal estrogen
replacement done great. seeing 20 years later, estrogen
predictor decreased risk Alzheimer's. got start trying
unpacking prospective type studies. much estrogen? times? Estrogen


catchall term bunch hormones, estrone, estradiol, estriol. much one
them? Natural synthetic? Go try figure out. second
complication is, often hard say anything estrogen outside
context progesterone doing. often not absolute levels either,
ratio two. complicated endocrine system
testosterone. generate dramatic cyclicity like no male
hypothalamus ever dream off. much, much complicated system, thus,
lot complicated understand,

00:39:40 Testosterone & Sperm Counts Males Really Dropping?

let alone like figure ideal benefits it. - Yeah. don't know
make literature dropping rates testosterone endocrine disruptors.
Berkeley Tyrone Hayes published data frogs drinking
water various locations throughout United States, not just California,
seeing severe endocrine disruption blockade or, androgen receptors
sorts issues. hear time now sperm counts
dropping, endocrine disruptors birth control
water, drinking water. starts sound little crazy, yet also
fooled by, guess good example be, lot crazy stuff
world online terrible stuff highly processed foods. yet got
respectable people, endocrinologists UCSF like Robert Lustig saying, yeah, lot
hidden sugars emulsifiers, causing real problems.
become open-minded question. so, suffering drops
sperm counts testosterone estrogen fertility consequence endocrine
disruptors environments food, social reasons? anything
can hang hat like real data confident in? just mess? -
No, phenomenon appear quite real. Cross-sectional studies, human
populations, still don't understand one first things Hayes
spotted. Decreasing testicle size crocodiles. [Andrew laughs] Go figure
one first contributions this. think phenomenon absolutely real.
left two classic challenges, correlated
something broad environmental toxins. ones, much, when, etc.?
one always being, well, okay, dropping dropping enough make difference.


big effect this? juries still out. - Yeah,
area know lot interest in, got groups people won't
touch receipt store BPAs inks the...
[laughs] got people don't care things. fascinating area.

00:42:15 Stress Mitigation & Sense Control

hope biology will done soon. like briefly return stress.
described study two rats, one running wheel voluntarily, one
basically stuck running wheel, forced run anytime, rat number one runs.
one case rat voluntarily exercising. [laughs] case, rat
forced go PE class, speak, really, seeing divergent effects
biology. like just touch use kind case study stress
mitigation general. rather obsessed colleague, David Spiegel, Associate
Chair Psychiatry Stanford obsessed question of, humans can start
mitigate stress? think stress mitigation
individuals families culture try encourage people
mitigate stress, ways not going turn us rat number two,
forced mitigate stress therefore becomes stressful.
[laughs] - see is, rat number one gets benefits exercise. Rat
number two gets downsides severe stress exact muscle
expenditure movements going on. Perfectly yoked, great example
interpretation head. haven't kept literature, bet you, rat
number two whole lot activity amygdala rat number one.
Okay, stress mitigation. Anything say preface with,
reasonably good telling people going happen don't manage
stress, terrible actually like managing stress advising manage that.
much better bad news aspect it. see is, now just classic
literature, half century old, sort showing building blocks stress. Not,
ooh, step outside gored elephant, can grow
experience? doesn't kill makes stronger.
stress response, realm gray zone ambiguous social
interactions, sort thing. people massive stress responses, others not
all, between, enjoy it. Like building blocks of, makes


psychological stress stressful? first one exactly brought
running study. sense control? sense control makes stressors less
stressful. running wheel shows studies you, lab rat
college freshman volunteer trained pressing lever, less likely
get shock. today lever working away unbeknownst
lever turned off, no effect shock frequency,
think control, less stress response. rat
day-in day-out, less likely get ulcer. sense
control. related sense predictability. Rat get shocked, human gets
shocked, whatever, scenario either shocks come now then,
shocks come now then, 10 seconds little warning light comes on.
get warning light, shocks distressful. got predictability
not getting warning lights, second half second away
next shock. get warning light, know isn't one, got
least 10 seconds worth relaxation. know coming, can prepare
coping responses, best afterward know finally safe,
can recover it. enormously protective. Others outlet frustration,
take rat getting shocked, run running wheel,
protective thing, voluntarily. got rat can gnaw bar
wood, stressor less stressful. Unfortunately, rat primate human
stressed, ability aggressively dump somebody smaller weaker
also reduces stress response. fact displacement aggression reduces
stress accounts huge percent triggers like unhappiness.
variables, get social support well. good one. Interpreting circumstances
good news rather bad. Hurray, got simple sort like take
home recipe go get much control much predictability many
outlets much social support possible, going just fine.
go that, recipe total disaster much, much
subtle that. one great example, okay, getting shocks, want
warning beforehand, get little warning light 10 seconds shock,
wonderfully protective. Get warning light one second shock doesn't
anything. not enough time get psychological benefits
anticipation. Now instead, gets little warning coming two minutes
shock, going make things worse not going sitting


like reveling sort sense predictability, soon going be, oh.
going sitting two minutes saying, damn, comes. Predictive
information works narrow domain. Similarly, control. want
sense control face stress? answer is, mild moderate
stressor happening then, sense control completely
independent reality whether control not, face mild
moderate stressors, sense control gets interpreted as, wow, look much worse
things been. Thank God, control, top master fate.
contrast, major stressor, arbitrary sense control make
think, oh God, look much better been. prevented it.
know intuitively like face people's worst stressors.
Nobody stopped car way kids suddenly jumped out. wouldn't
mattered gotten doctor month ago, instead now,
wouldn't made any... didn't actually control. see is,
absolutely want huge sense control mild moderate stressors,
especially ones result good outcome. Hooray, me, face horrible
stressors, want like self-deception, like truth beauty don't
necessarily go hand-in-hand point. stress management techniques
impact control predictability wind far worse neutral preaching
somebody homeless somebody terminal cancer, somebody
refugee. Tell neurotic middle-class person psychological tools
turn hell heaven. truth that. thing somebody
going real hell, just privileged heartlessness
doesn't work. outlets, outlets damaging,
not good way mitigate stress. Social support, confusing mere
acquaintances real social support, going rug pulled
point. mistaking social support being, going bitching
moaning demanding supportiveness everyone around rather
reciprocally, not going work well either. not simple.
not nothing lots us really lousy. It, like good friends things
like that, takes lot work right? wrong may
temporarily seem like great thing, turns completely misplaced
faith, going feeling worse started.



00:51:35 Best Buffer Stress

- Interesting. days, lot interest using physical practices mitigate
stress, trying get ruminating, extent take control neural
circuits brain using exercise using breathing hypnosis. And, course,
hypnosis mental component well. thoughts stress mitigation
standpoint of, okay, don't want rat number two, want select
something ourselves, take initiative ourselves. forced
exercising not, actually negative health effect perhaps. need
pick something like, need take control it. terms supporting
people, touched bit. best way support people?
talk stressful thing? mean, not asking play psychologist here,
find divergent data this. can spin lather ruminating
something. language seems like wonderful tool, also fairly
deprived tool doesn't really get core physiology like something
like breathing would. thoughts more, lack better way put
it, head-centered, cognitive approaches stress mitigation versus kind going
core physiology. Cold showers now even thing extent just get
people stress acclimated, voluntarily taking cold showers. - makes sense
physiologically, preconditioning real stressors come. terms
bring up, oh, transcendental meditation, mindfulness, exercise, prayer, sort reflecting
gratitude, sort thing. Collectively work average, work
terms of, can lower heart rate cholesterol levels sorts good
outcomes, compromise us. One exactly caveat comes
running wheel study is, doesn't matter many friends swear stress
management technique. makes want scream head off 10
seconds, not one going work you. read fine print
testimonials, got something works you. Another one stress
management type techniques work, can't save weekend, can't
save stuck hold phone Muzak two minutes.
got something stop virtually, daily every
day, spend 20, 30 minutes it. see coming
like 80/20 rule economics. 80/20, 80% complaints store come
20% customers, things like that. see is, entire life consists


every single thing shoulders, can't say no 24/7. stopped
finally said, wellbeing important enough finally get say no
stuff can't say no to. going every day 20 minutes,
whatever stress management technique 20 minutes sort
knows what, already 80% way simply decided
wellbeing important enough going stop every single day
priority. exactly finding find people chronic
depression untreated merely calling getting appointment see mental
health professional, people start feeling better already evidence
activated, matter enough this, conceive
actually good outcome rather hopeless one. Just something
meditative reflective every day so, hardly even matters one
doing. comes thus another warning, not trust anybody
says, scientifically proven brand stress management works
better ones. Just watch wallet point. - Yeah, amen. think one
core goals lab David Spiegel's lab, know worked
David published papers David well really try find
various entry points thing call autonomic nervous system
stress system, systems gone unchecked really can take us
dark path. idea many entry points really one keeps,
data keep telling us again. no magic breathing tool
exercise, variety one those. And, again, come back idea
one select one make space for, one
hopefully enjoy going work best terms physiology. - [mumbles]
benign people stuck around you.

00:57:04 Power Perception, Choice & Individual Differences

- Right, right, absolutely. brings question of, find amazing
perceive event, whether not chose event not can
incredible different effects circuitry brain circuitry body
biology cells. ways boggles mind, like can decision made
presumably prefrontal cortex, although parts brain well, can
change essentially polarity response body. And, mean, talked


Type personalities there. don't go detail
sake time, interesting effects endothelial cells. mean, literally
size of, [laughs] portals blood opposite direction, depending
whether not somebody wants situation highly motivated person. Maybe
just give us top contour think really illustrates
principle beautifully. maybe would, just speculate
brain might switch turn one experience terrible beneficial
beneficial terrible, really fascinating. - Well, need like tonight
going sleep lying bed nice drowsy
heart's beating nice slow, start thinking fact heart isn't going
beat forever. [Andrew laughs] imagine toes getting cold afterward
imagine flow blood coming halt clotting. going
something physiology point 99% mammals
running frantically. going turning sympathetic
stress response thought, emotions, memory. measure
just much cortex limbic system sends projections
autonomic regulators brain. can think autonomic regulatory neurons
action ways animals can like extremes environmental

understanding gigantic individual differences. that's, talk
optimal amount stress, counts stimulation, general stress not
severe doesn't go long overall benevolence setting.
conditions, love stressed something unexpected
control predictability like really interesting plot turn movie watching.
great, get individual differences somehow accommodate
fact people, perfect stimulatory amount stress like getting
early Audubon birdwatching walk next Sunday morning. somebody else,
signing like mercenary Yemen. [Andrew laughs]

01:00:32 Context-Setting, Prefrontal Cortex & Hierarchy

tremendous individual differences swamp simple prescriptions. - Yeah,
prefrontal cortex, thinking machinery harbor, double-edged
sword. remarkable is, areas brain like hypothalamus


amygdala, sort like switches. mean, context gain
control. talked gain control testosterone, etc., really like
switches. mean, stimulate ventromedial hypothalamus, get right neurons,
animal will try kill even object sitting next it. tickle
neurons, it'll try mate object. mean, really wild. think
probably rules prefrontal cortex also, sounds like context plural
prefrontal cortex can draw probably infinite, probably learn
perceive threat anything. Whether not another group whether not
science whether not somebody's version shape earth versus
another. mean, like, can plug anything system give enough data,
think sounds like drive fear response love response.
overstepping? - [laughs] mixed horribly ambivalent one changing
millisecond, like mutually contradictory. No, absolutely case
prefrontal cortex, regretted like wasted 30 years
life studying hippocampus shoot studied prefrontal cortex
much interesting does, contextual stuff.
ways not okay lie setting, great thing another.
not okay kill unless them, get medal. not,
social context moral relativity situational ethic stuff, prefrontal cortex
got master that. winds meaning place brain
anywhere say perception things can powerfully influence
reality coming you. - Yeah. - mean, great example, just harking back
testosterone. Okay, exercise boosts testosterone levels. exercise
success exercise failure? literature back 80s looking
outcomes marathons. testosterone rise people win
losers? Wrestling matches. Things sort simple prediction answer
wound being, didn't see simple answer. Okay, win marathon, not
necessarily predictor increased testosterone. about? find
like winner testosterone decreases, find guy came 73rd
massive testosterone increase. Whoa, about?
far human subtlety. guy won race decline testosterone
came three minutes later really, really expecting.
everybody now going writing hill. guy
came 73rd boost testosterone assuming dead


heart attack third mile, [Andrew laughs] instead managed finish.
interpretive stuff going there, prefrontal cortex about. -
Amazing, raises question cognitive flexibility, Can tell
something good us even not enjoying it? can wriggle around
corners choosing exercise the... Personally not big fan long bouts
meditation, benefited tremendously things like dedicated breathing
shorter rounds meditation. Can tell good wriggle around
corner get physiology working way want? cognitive
flexibility? Can third place runner tell myself, well, least came in,
wanted win badly. primary goal, another goal beat
previous time, that. so, [laughs] mean, it's... extent can
toggle relationship prefrontal cortex primitive
systems? - Well, enormous amount. example, low hierarchy
generally bad health like every mammal there, including us,
something special, can part multiple hierarchies time.
maybe low ranking one them, extremely high ranking
another, like crappiest job corporation, captain
softball team year company. better bet somebody
going find sorts ways decide nine five Monday Fridays, just stupid
paying bills. really matters prestige weekend. poorer,
deacon church here. can play sorts psychological
games that. One like consistent, reliable ones need
use frontal cortex like crazy is, somebody something rotten need
attribute it. answer is, something wrong, hmm, rotten.
Always always will constitutional explanation. something
rotten somebody, explain afterward? situational one. tired,
stressed sort setting, misunderstood this. best excusing
bad things access inner lives got
prefrontal cortexes great coming situational explanation rather than,
hey, maybe just like selfish rotten human, need change.
prefrontal cortex, every time, don't let somebody merge lane
front us, even though curse somebody thing and...
Endlessly. - love it. statement fact can select multiple
hierarchies participate in. seems like particularly important one nowadays


social media prevalent. know not particularly active social
media although might pleasantly, don't know unpleasantly surprised find
lot positive discussion work, don't even
need there. just continue discuss [laughs] work.
interesting social media found context very, broad. mean,
one argue one selects follow news articles reading,
etc. can create kind funneling information can dangerous.
verification crazy ideas even just less exposure new ideas. also
idea social media incredibly broad context. scroll feed,
no longer like eighth grade classroom office faculty
meeting. exposed thousands, not millions contexts, meal,
soccer game, person's body, person's intellect. YouTube another example.
vast, vast landscape. context completely mishmash whereas assuming
evolved. think evolve contexts much constrained.
interacted limited number individuals limited number different domains,
seasons tended constrain us all. course, got phones televisions,
started expand, now ever, brain, prefrontal cortex
sense exist multiple hierarchies essentially wicked
infinity. think might interacting primitive
systems aspects biology? - Well, think get is, ways
punchline of, human humans, use
exact blueprint, hormones, kinases, receptors,
same, everything built exact stuff species
there, go use completely novel way. usually terms
able abstract stuff space time dramatic ways. So, okay, low
ranking baboon can feel badly just like killed rabbit
eat higher ranking guy boots off takes away you,
feel crummy stressful unhappy. exact
things like brain bodies losing sense self-esteem,
can watching movie character screen feeling inadequate compared
like wonderful attractive are. can somebody driving past us
expensive car, don't even see face, can feel belittled
socioeconomic status. can watch like Lifestyles Rich Famous
read Bezos to. reason, decide life less fulfilling


didn't fly space 11 minutes. can feel miserable
ways no organism can, simply can
meaningful social networks include like party reading Facebook
weren't invited taking place Singapore, don't know
people, nonetheless, somehow means

01:11:20 Dr. Sapolsky Accomplishes Deep Thinking

feel less content turned be. take steps life
actively restrict contexts think live contemplate order
enhance creative life, intellectual life? steps actively take? -
Well, actively don't know make use anything [laughs] social media.
guess counts thus actively chosen not learn how.
case certainly last year half, like lots people, gone stretches
managed sort enforce moratorium looking news,
wonderfully freeing. think larger sense though, addition
neurobiologist, sort spent decades spending part year studying wild
baboons national park East Africa. spend three months year without
electricity, without phone calls, going 12 hours day without saying word
somebody. finally would, somebody nomadic pastoralist guy
different language. Yeah, 90% like insightful thinking anything
laboratory three months year, not one lab, not
inundated stuff. - Well, think shifting trend towards trying create
narrowing context that... like see, niece, 14-years-old
friends good putting phones away. say, not
going phones interaction, especially after... realized still
somewhat this. unclear headed,

01:13:17 Free Will?

2020 restrictive separated friends. Now it's,
really focus together not bring elements phones.
brings great hope generation, [laughs] maybe will...
knows, maybe run off study baboons, need field researchers.


along lines choice, like shift gears slightly talk freewill,
ability make choices all. - Well, personal way left field inflammatory
stance is, don't think shred freewill despite 95% philosophers.
think probably majority neuroscientists saying freewill least
circumstances. don't think all. reason is,
something, behave, make choice, whatever. understand
that, intention come from? Part due like sensory
environment previous minute. hormone levels
bloodstream morning. whether wonderful
stressful last three months sort neuroplasticity happened. Part
hormone levels exposed fetus. Part culture ancestors
came with, thus parented kid.
there, can understand behavior coming without incorporating
those. point, not relevant factors,
ultimately one factor. talking evolution
behavior, definition also talking genetics. talking
genes behavior, definition talking brain
constructed proteins coded for. talking like mood
disorder now, talking sense efficacy getting five-year-
old. intertwined. look influences, basically like
challenge is, show neuron just caused behavior, show network
neurons just caused behavior. show nothing just
influenced anything sensory environment one second ago
evolution species. no space fit freewill concept
winds brain, not brain. simply no wiggle room
there. - can appreciate behaviors choices consequences
long line dominoes fell prior behavior. possible can
intervene domino effect, speak. words, can recognition
fact genes heritability, epigenome that, hormonal context,
historical context. Can knowledge give small shard
freewill? Meaning, allow say, ah, okay, accept choices
somewhat predetermined, yet knowing gives additional layer
control? philosophical biological universe works? - Nah.
can produce wonderfully positive belief change can happen. Even


traumatic change, even worst circumstances, unlikely people, change
can happen, things can change. Don't fatalistic, don't decide
mechanistic, biological machines nothing can ever... Change can happen,
people go off rails translating into, can change ourselves. don't,
can't no freewill. However, can changed circumstance.
point is, like look Aplysia, sea slug learned retract gill
response shock tail, can like conditioning, Pavlovian conditioning
it, learned, behavior changed environment. hear
news something like horrifically depressing going on, refugees wherever.
result, feel little bit helpless less sense efficacy
world, behaviors changed. Okay, okay, yeah, guess that,
remarkable thing is, exact neurobiology. signal transduction
pathways happening sea snail incorporate exact kinases
proteases phosphatases mammalian fear
conditioning, alert, conserved. exact thing, simply
playing obviously much, much fancier domain. learned
change possible despite understanding mechanistically can't change
volitionally, understand change possible, just
changed ability brain respond optimistic stimuli. changed
ability brain now send direction exposed
information will seem cheerful rather depressing. Oh God, amazing,
Nelson Mandela Martin Luther king folks did. Wow,
adverse circumstances, able do. Maybe can also, maybe can go
read people like get even data points change
neurochemistry, responses different now. tilted little bit
direction feeling like can make difference instead damn
hopeless. enormous change can happen, last thing come
view of, nothing less sum biology interactions
environment,

01:20:50 Apply Knowledge & Learning

throw hands say, thus no use trying change anything. -
can acknowledge change extremely hard impossible, circumstances


can change, yet striving better human beings still worthwhile
endeavor. correct? - Absolutely. simply knowledge, either
experience making end right neurobiology class taught
change can happen within framework mechanistic neurobiology.
now open made optimistic good news world around you.
likely inspired that, resistant getting
discouraged bad news, simply now understand possible. - Mm-hmm,
yeah, somebody spent much career working hippocampus,
assume believer neuroplasticity, neural circuits can change
response experience, so-called top-down mechanisms
prefrontal cortex talking can play role there,
decision try change pursuit knowledge pursuit experience
can shape circuitry, therefore make us different machines, speak. - Yeah.
not can say prenatal hormone exposure changed way brain
constructed, learning prenatal hormone exposure can change construction
brain will change brain right now, think
intentions came from. Wow, maybe something it. knowledge
knowledge effector itself. - important powerful
statement hear. think many people think tool, doesn't involve pill
protocol, useless. certainly pills protocols
useful variety context variety things, idea knowledge itself,
whereas put it, knowledge knowledge tool, think important
concept people embed minds. And, listen, grateful discussion
raising topics. think people, many people know work
testosterone, stress, covered today, work freewill
idea hopeless total control. think realizing
listening neither true, solution resides

01:23:44 Robert’s New Book: “Determined: Science Life Without Free Will”

understanding freewill lack it, [laughs] also neuroplasticity.
working book freewill, willing tell us little bit
book process can look forward to? - Yeah,
going really slow. Title is, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill."


essentially first half book trying convince reader, okay, not
no freewill whatsoever, least lot less normally assumed.
going standard arguments freewill, doesn't make sense
21st century science? led reading lot frustrating
philosophers basically willing admit stuff made like atoms
molecules. like physical reality sort world, not just relying
magic, believe freewill magical reasons, doesn't make
sense. Okay, first half book hopefully convince people
much less freewill used think. second half gigantic
juncture built around fact haven't thought freewill since like
adolescent. despite thinking way, still absolutely no idea
supposed function belief. supposed go everyday life
anything feel entitled isn't true? angers hatreds feel aren't justified,
no thing appropriate, blame punishment praise reward,
none makes sense, somebody like even compliments haircut,
conditioned say, oh, thanks, something do.
supposed function that? second half wrestling that,
punchline is, going incredibly hard. think going
hard subtract notion freewill making sense like serial murderers,
going thousand times harder making sense somebody says "good job"
you. [Andrew laughs] exact reality sort
interpretations. going incredibly hard, nonetheless look
history subtracted notion agency sorts realms
blame, starting thinking witches caused hailstorms 500 years ago notion
psychodynamically screwed mothers cause schizophrenia, done it.
done endless number times, able subtract sense volition
understanding world works around us. don't murderers running
amuck street, society hasn't collapsed puddle, fact,
humane society. good news possible done repeatedly
past, going hard hell. hard hell try write
coherently, [laughs] discovering, going slowly. - Well, speak many, many
people say really excited book done will
patiently wait, great excitement book, "Determined". said title,
correct? - Yeah, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill". seems like


can't publish book days without sub-title, it? - Fantastic. Well,
excited read book. grateful conversation today, learned
ton. Every time speak learn, really pleasure delight
interact today previous years, say, colleagues.
thank again, Robert, everything hard, hard work
thinking put work clear put lot hard work

going roughly brain activation profile, whether
something wonderful something terrible one exception
amygdala part activation, something going counting
adverse. Whether circumstance, adverse circumstance recruiting
amygdala it, much amygdala involved, biases towards
interpreting even awful.

00:11:00 Testosterone: Common Myths vs. Actual Truths

amygdala ways kind checkpoint whether talking
excitement terror. - use amygdala transition point another topic
spent many years working thinking about, testosterone
sex steroid hormones. heard say among brain areas
bind testosterone, testosterone can park create effects amygdala
among chockablock full parking spots, receptors. realize
lot here, think role testosterone amygdala
given engagement amygdala fundamental transition point
exhilarating, positive response negative stressful response? maybe
just broadly, think testosterone effects brain? -
pertinent transition whether stressor evoking fear revoking
aggression terms continuum, also amygdala center
four points axes. Basically, almost everybody completely wrong
idea testosterone does, testosterone makes aggressive
males, virtually every species testosterone aggressive
seasonal measures testosterone surging time year, punching
territory. take testosterone picture, castrate
mammal there, including us, levels aggression will go down. easy
thing tends conclude testosterone causes aggression. reality
testosterone no thing, doesn't cause aggression. can see
behaviorally amygdala. testosterone do? lowers threshold
sort things normally provoke [mumbles]
happens easily. makes systems already turned on, turn louder rather
turning aggressive music thing. look like
behaviorally? take five male monkeys, put together, form dominance


hierarchy. Number one great, number five miserable, number three right
between. Now take number three shoot guy tons testosterone
going involved fights. Aha, testosterone uniformly causes aggression,
look closely pattern it, number three now challenging numbers
two one place hierarchy. Absolutely not, brown-nosing
exactly much used to. going just miserable terror poor
number four five. case, testosterone amplifying
preexisting patterns aggression. Amplifying social learning, it'd gone
there. Now sort reductive level, translate
amygdala? testosterone make amygdaloid neurons action potentials?
cause neurons suddenly speak fear aggression spontaneously?
Absolutely not. is, amygdala already stimulated, increases
rate neuronal firing. worth? shortens after-hyperpolarizations.
theme exactly is, not creating aggression, just upping volume
whatever aggression already there. factor in, impossible say
anything testosterone

00:15:15 Behaviors Affect Testosterone

outside context testosterone related behaviors, get treated [laughs]
social settings. - Mm-hmm, yeah. terms status relationship
individuals, either nonhuman primates humans, can say testosterone
levels testosterone? say, can say relative levels
testosterone individuals correlated status within hierarchy? - Yes,
way winds totally uninteresting. Like go back whatever number
decades, endocrinology texts, two totally reliable findings there.
see, dog that's- - Oh, good, like dogs Huberman Lab
podcast. - Oh, okay, jingling that. - welcome, absolutely
welcome, yeah. - there'd two truisms, higher levels testosterone
predict higher levels aggression humans animals. Higher levels
testosterone predict higher levels sexual activity. Whoa, testosterone causing both,
correlation there. look closely, got cause effect stuff,
sexual behavior raises testosterone levels, aggression raises testosterone levels.
levels barely predictive going happen, response


rather cause. look though terms making sense individual
differences, don't matter whole lot. can spend entire career social
circumstances produce 3.5% testosterone circulation, expect see
sorts interesting implications. not really case, somewhat yes
no modulator much subtle social stuff already there. -
interesting.

00:17:20 Mindsets & Contexts Affect Testosterone

think lot misconceptions human biology, testosterone
seems one area least can find internet, sort
peak misunderstanding. Maybe just ask questions
testosterone sexual behavior interesting story
castration versus non-castration causality, again. address that,
just want highlight something said think vital,
behaviors, aggressive behaviors sexual behaviors can actually increase
testosterone. hear correctly? - Yeah. - reverse sort true, not
causal way. right? - opposite direction causality, yeah. - Yeah, yeah,
increase somebody's testosterone 30%, male female doesn't matter,
sexual behavior may may not change. - Essentially zero effect all. brain
not sensitive fluctuations testosterone levels. terms things like
aggression, raising testosterone, great footnote. right type
willing die trenches devotion sort thing, watching favorite team play
sport will raise testosterone levels sit potato chips
armchair. not physicality aggression, psychological framing it. So,
yeah, testosterone not causing that. great way appreciate is, okay,
testosterone sexual behavior correlations, definitive
endocrine intervention, subtraction study, removed testes.
said before, levels sexual behavior goes down. Good, just shown
testosterone somehow caused it. Critically go down, not zero,
whether rat monkey human, whatever. predicts much
residual sexual behavior there, much sexual behavior
castration? telling behavior carried social
learning context rather hormone, exact thing aggression.


Drops castration, doesn't go zero, prior history it, just
keeps coasting along even without testosterone. - interesting. Can
say exception terms early organizing effects hormones? Like,
instance, developing animal deprived testosterone estrogen
aromatized testosterone estrogen, whole story is, know.
imagine circuits brain responsible initiating sexual
behavior first place might not emerge, therefore not sensitive
testosterone later life. right?

00:20:28 Finger Length Ratios Reflect Prenatal Hormone Levels

Okay. - Yeah, exactly. great way seeing totally nutty biological
factoid, second fourth digit ratio enhanced. - Oh yeah. - Totally obscure
thing, ratio one way reflects levels testosterone, androgen
exposure fetal life. can't remember way goes minuscule
need thousand people sample size able see anything, see
primates, already fetal sonograms, that. readout
subtle differences prenatal exposure, winds predictor whole
range sort stuff adult behavior. So, yeah, fetal end, still
building everything, testosterone amount making huge difference.
time adult, just somewhat old non-signal. - Yeah,
confession, master's student Berkeley Marc Breedlove's
arena, author paper, although deep within author line,
got description exactly right D2, index finger ring finger
ratio similar females males. males, index finger tends
shorter. people listening now freaking
measuring, proper way measure this, is, eyeballing doesn't
work time unless extremes. interesting stories there.
actually replicated no fewer five times, Marc Breedlove tells me.
yes, terms early organizing effects, seem robust studies.
later effects sort activation neural circuits hormones.

00:22:30 Aggression: Male-Female, Female-Male, & Female-Female



absolutely fascinated this. couple questions, is,
normally associate testosterone males, course, females make testosterone
well adrenals presumably elsewhere too. guessing looked hard
enough, probably find sources androgens females. Can
say general contours effects aggression also pertain females?
suppose ask particular female-female aggression,
exist many species, female-male agregression well maternal aggression,
robust aspect evolution, course, mother will, angry mother
animal kind protecting young truly dangerous, best sense word.
- type post-parturition, period birth aggression estrogen,
progesterone, sorts things. Female aggression, rest time
testosterone major player much lower level average. average,
one always say, basically punchlines. females, lower
levels testosterone essential typical levels aggression sexual behavior.
Nonetheless, not causing it, not sensitive small individual differences.
exact thing. can get way over-impressed

00:24:05 Testosterone: Challenge Hypothesis

importance androgens females just readily males. - line
that, conceptualize testosterone? realize isn't single sentence
can capture hormone effects hormones many different
slow fast effects brain, glands own, glands
produce them. heard talk testosterone today years,
start get impression misunderstood molecule [laughs] human
health universe, clearly something powerful. shifting way
certain neural circuits work, adjusting gain amygdala, described,
certainly things well. truism testosterone like,
relationship effort relationship resilience, way maybe will help
people sort think think testosterone? - Yeah. Maybe
three separate answers that. first one is, think fair summary think
comes motivated strong behaviors, testosterone make
whatever already are. me, sexual arousal, libido, aggressiveness,
spontaneous aggression, reactive aggression, things sort. upping volume


things already strongly there. Second way think is, well, like
favorite finding testosterone. wonderful work guy,
John Wingfield, one best behavioral endocrinologists there.
20 years ago formulated called Challenge Hypothesis Testosterone
Action. testosterone do? Testosterone secrete
status challenged, makes likely behaviors
needed hold onto status. Okay, totally boringly straightforward
baboon. somebody challenging high rank, appropriate response
part going aggression. right, just got back door,
testosterone aggression, again. get humans, humans lots
different ways achieving maintaining status. need go like
fancy private school's annual auction, will see half-drunk alpha
males competing see can give money away show conspicuous
like property have. setting like that, mean, haven't able take
urine samples, times, unfortunately, shows flip side it.
species hands status different sort way, testosterone going
boost also. Okay, generates totally nutty prediction. Wow, take people
circumstance, say playing economic game get status trustworthy
generous interactions game. give people testosterone,
make generous? absolutely case. Totally cool
finding. showing you, don't know, basically took whole bunch Buddhist
monks shot testosterone, get competitive
random acts kindness. societal problem
much aggression, first culprit look not testosterone, first look
hand much damn elevated status aggression many
circumstances. find finding fantastic. Third thing subtlety
testosterone. Okay, like subtler behavioral effects, give testosterone
people become confident, become self-confident. Well,
good, people pay take sorts nonsensical self-help courses will boost
self-esteem. good thing unless testosterone makes confident,
inaccurate, likely barrel wrong decisions. shown
economic game play testosterone making confident makes less
cooperative needs cooperate top own.
Testosterone makes people cocky impulsive. might great one setting,


is, absolutely sure army get
country three days. hell, start World War I, get big surprise it.
Testosterone altering risk assessment beforehand probably played big role kind
miscalculation.

00:29:20 Dopamine Impacts Testosterone & Motivation

- Super-interesting. always think testosterone dopamine close cousins
brain, not just relationship pituitary
hypothalamus. That, course, also dopamine's salient role creating
bias towards exteroception. somebody takes drug, increases
dopamine, chockablock full dopamine. tend, want highlight 'tend'
is, really generalizing here, tend focus outward goals,
things beyond boundaries skin. testosterone seems bit
same, tends put us similar mode perceiving outside world ways
asking questions like, relate species? relate
goals? anything can better conceptualize relationship
testosterone dopamine motivation? just take us
alleyways of, neural pathways hypothalamus? fine too. - Well,
think got lots sort massive revisionism dopamine. Everyone,
since pharaohs got brought taught dopamine pleasure
reward. turns isn't, anticipation reward, generating
motivation, goal-directed behavior needed go get reward.
know it, using like elevated dopamine, entire life motivate
whatever going get like entry heaven after-life kind of, sort
thing. really motivation. testosterone even individuals
not aggressive testosterone replacement often helpful thing
aging males increases energy, increases sense thereness, presence
alertness increases motivation. whole aspect, takes us
motivation get like go, hand lots soup soup kitchen
homeless people, get go ethnically cleanse village. got much
makeup testosterone got onboard. activating
energetic sense, testosterone within minutes increases glucose uptake skeletal
muscle. just awake alert that, lot


dopamine does. one might predict then, getting just right levels
testosterone infused bloodstream feels great lab rats. will lever press
get infused range optimizes dopamine release. is,
absolutely right, deeply intertwined. - Yeah, beautiful biology there.

00:32:32 Estrogen: Improves Brain & Longevity TIMING KEY

love way encapsulate relationship. want ask estrogen,
don't hear estrogen often, always interesting now
public facing education, testosterone controversial molecule, just say
almost controversial. [laughs] [Robert laughs] estrogen doesn't seem hold
controversial weight, yet estrogen powerful effects
animal brain human brain males females. Men not want
estrogen go low. Terrible things happen, will lose cognitive function, libido
can drop. men need estrogen well, perhaps maybe can put filter
estrogen testosterone. general themes estrogen
people aware think generally misunderstood? really
feelings empathy making us sensitive? sense not. - No,
context dependent. estrogen giving birth playing central
role wanting shred face somebody getting close kittens kind
thing, know not just warm, fuzzy, empathic kind stuff. Estrogen lots
ways summarized by, got choice matter lot
estrogen bloodstream not, go lot estrogen. enhances
cognition, exactly said, stimulates neurogenesis hippocampus,
increases glucose oxygen delivery, protects dementia, decreases
inflammatory oxidative damage blood vessels, good protecting
cardiovascular disease contrast testosterone, making everyone
things worse. springs minefield question, is,
post-menopausal estrogen? sorts lab studies non-human primates
suggested keep estrogen levels high monkey's equivalent
menopause. going keep brain health lot better decreasing risk
dementia, stroke, every thing. Estrogen great antioxidant, that.
90s think Healy, forgetting name, first female
head NIH, Bernadine Healy set massive prospective human study,


going biggest one times, looking pluses minuses post-
menopausal estrogen. tens thousands women, was...
cut study short seeing was, estrogen not
normal bad stuff expect terms decalcification stuff,
increasing risk cardiovascular disease, increasing risk stroke,
increasing risk dementia. ground halt everybody,
stopped study front page news everybody panned point. nobody
make sense spending last 20 years studying exact
thing primates seeing protective effects. explanation turned
one things like law unexpected consequences. Okay,
menopause women, lasts different lengths time, may factor going
come. know what, not start giving study subjects estrogen
totally past menopause. got lag time between, shift
sorts estrogen receptor patterns, bad effects come from.
- Wow! - monkey studies involved just maintaining ovulatory levels
post-menopausal period. get great effects. Estrogen one
greatest predictors protection Alzheimer's disease, that, needs
physiological. Just keep continuing body long time
versus let whole thing shutdown suddenly like try fire coal stoves
bottom basement kind thing, get going, get utterly different
outcomes. caused lot human health consequences people suddenly
decided estrogen fact neurologically endangering post-menopausally. - Wow,
fascinating. never thought steroid hormone receptors not
binding estrogen, devoid estrogen binding, say, set off
opposite biochemical cascades. Fascinating. guess raises question
testosterone replacement too, whether not people [laughs] talk doctor
long. Men women talk physicians long avoid these,
whatever happening periods isn't sufficient testosterone and/or
estrogen. sounds like cause longer-term problems even therapies
introduced. - Two additional misery slash complications. So, okay, trying
understand, look women history without post-menopausal estrogen
replacement done great. seeing 20 years later, estrogen
predictor decreased risk Alzheimer's. got start trying
unpacking prospective type studies. much estrogen? times? Estrogen


catchall term bunch hormones, estrone, estradiol, estriol. much one
them? Natural synthetic? Go try figure out. second
complication is, often hard say anything estrogen outside
context progesterone doing. often not absolute levels either,
ratio two. complicated endocrine system
testosterone. generate dramatic cyclicity like no male
hypothalamus ever dream off. much, much complicated system, thus,
lot complicated understand,

00:39:40 Testosterone & Sperm Counts Males Really Dropping?

let alone like figure ideal benefits it. - Yeah. don't know
make literature dropping rates testosterone endocrine disruptors.
Berkeley Tyrone Hayes published data frogs drinking
water various locations throughout United States, not just California,
seeing severe endocrine disruption blockade or, androgen receptors
sorts issues. hear time now sperm counts
dropping, endocrine disruptors birth control
water, drinking water. starts sound little crazy, yet also
fooled by, guess good example be, lot crazy stuff
world online terrible stuff highly processed foods. yet got
respectable people, endocrinologists UCSF like Robert Lustig saying, yeah, lot
hidden sugars emulsifiers, causing real problems.
become open-minded question. so, suffering drops
sperm counts testosterone estrogen fertility consequence endocrine
disruptors environments food, social reasons? anything
can hang hat like real data confident in? just mess? -
No, phenomenon appear quite real. Cross-sectional studies, human
populations, still don't understand one first things Hayes
spotted. Decreasing testicle size crocodiles. [Andrew laughs] Go figure
one first contributions this. think phenomenon absolutely real.
left two classic challenges, correlated
something broad environmental toxins. ones, much, when, etc.?
one always being, well, okay, dropping dropping enough make difference.


big effect this? juries still out. - Yeah,
area know lot interest in, got groups people won't
touch receipt store BPAs inks the...
[laughs] got people don't care things. fascinating area.

00:42:15 Stress Mitigation & Sense Control

hope biology will done soon. like briefly return stress.
described study two rats, one running wheel voluntarily, one
basically stuck running wheel, forced run anytime, rat number one runs.
one case rat voluntarily exercising. [laughs] case, rat
forced go PE class, speak, really, seeing divergent effects
biology. like just touch use kind case study stress
mitigation general. rather obsessed colleague, David Spiegel, Associate
Chair Psychiatry Stanford obsessed question of, humans can start
mitigate stress? think stress mitigation
individuals families culture try encourage people
mitigate stress, ways not going turn us rat number two,
forced mitigate stress therefore becomes stressful.
[laughs] - see is, rat number one gets benefits exercise. Rat
number two gets downsides severe stress exact muscle
expenditure movements going on. Perfectly yoked, great example
interpretation head. haven't kept literature, bet you, rat
number two whole lot activity amygdala rat number one.
Okay, stress mitigation. Anything say preface with,
reasonably good telling people going happen don't manage
stress, terrible actually like managing stress advising manage that.
much better bad news aspect it. see is, now just classic
literature, half century old, sort showing building blocks stress. Not,
ooh, step outside gored elephant, can grow
experience? doesn't kill makes stronger.
stress response, realm gray zone ambiguous social
interactions, sort thing. people massive stress responses, others not
all, between, enjoy it. Like building blocks of, makes


psychological stress stressful? first one exactly brought
running study. sense control? sense control makes stressors less
stressful. running wheel shows studies you, lab rat
college freshman volunteer trained pressing lever, less likely
get shock. today lever working away unbeknownst
lever turned off, no effect shock frequency,
think control, less stress response. rat
day-in day-out, less likely get ulcer. sense
control. related sense predictability. Rat get shocked, human gets
shocked, whatever, scenario either shocks come now then,
shocks come now then, 10 seconds little warning light comes on.
get warning light, shocks distressful. got predictability
not getting warning lights, second half second away
next shock. get warning light, know isn't one, got
least 10 seconds worth relaxation. know coming, can prepare
coping responses, best afterward know finally safe,
can recover it. enormously protective. Others outlet frustration,
take rat getting shocked, run running wheel,
protective thing, voluntarily. got rat can gnaw bar
wood, stressor less stressful. Unfortunately, rat primate human
stressed, ability aggressively dump somebody smaller weaker
also reduces stress response. fact displacement aggression reduces
stress accounts huge percent triggers like unhappiness.
variables, get social support well. good one. Interpreting circumstances
good news rather bad. Hurray, got simple sort like take
home recipe go get much control much predictability many
outlets much social support possible, going just fine.
go that, recipe total disaster much, much
subtle that. one great example, okay, getting shocks, want
warning beforehand, get little warning light 10 seconds shock,
wonderfully protective. Get warning light one second shock doesn't
anything. not enough time get psychological benefits
anticipation. Now instead, gets little warning coming two minutes
shock, going make things worse not going sitting


like reveling sort sense predictability, soon going be, oh.
going sitting two minutes saying, damn, comes. Predictive
information works narrow domain. Similarly, control. want
sense control face stress? answer is, mild moderate
stressor happening then, sense control completely
independent reality whether control not, face mild
moderate stressors, sense control gets interpreted as, wow, look much worse
things been. Thank God, control, top master fate.
contrast, major stressor, arbitrary sense control make
think, oh God, look much better been. prevented it.
know intuitively like face people's worst stressors.
Nobody stopped car way kids suddenly jumped out. wouldn't
mattered gotten doctor month ago, instead now,
wouldn't made any... didn't actually control. see is,
absolutely want huge sense control mild moderate stressors,
especially ones result good outcome. Hooray, me, face horrible
stressors, want like self-deception, like truth beauty don't
necessarily go hand-in-hand point. stress management techniques
impact control predictability wind far worse neutral preaching
somebody homeless somebody terminal cancer, somebody
refugee. Tell neurotic middle-class person psychological tools
turn hell heaven. truth that. thing somebody
going real hell, just privileged heartlessness
doesn't work. outlets, outlets damaging,
not good way mitigate stress. Social support, confusing mere
acquaintances real social support, going rug pulled
point. mistaking social support being, going bitching
moaning demanding supportiveness everyone around rather
reciprocally, not going work well either. not simple.
not nothing lots us really lousy. It, like good friends things
like that, takes lot work right? wrong may
temporarily seem like great thing, turns completely misplaced
faith, going feeling worse started.



00:51:35 Best Buffer Stress

- Interesting. days, lot interest using physical practices mitigate
stress, trying get ruminating, extent take control neural
circuits brain using exercise using breathing hypnosis. And, course,
hypnosis mental component well. thoughts stress mitigation
standpoint of, okay, don't want rat number two, want select
something ourselves, take initiative ourselves. forced
exercising not, actually negative health effect perhaps. need
pick something like, need take control it. terms supporting
people, touched bit. best way support people?
talk stressful thing? mean, not asking play psychologist here,
find divergent data this. can spin lather ruminating
something. language seems like wonderful tool, also fairly
deprived tool doesn't really get core physiology like something
like breathing would. thoughts more, lack better way put
it, head-centered, cognitive approaches stress mitigation versus kind going
core physiology. Cold showers now even thing extent just get
people stress acclimated, voluntarily taking cold showers. - makes sense
physiologically, preconditioning real stressors come. terms
bring up, oh, transcendental meditation, mindfulness, exercise, prayer, sort reflecting
gratitude, sort thing. Collectively work average, work
terms of, can lower heart rate cholesterol levels sorts good
outcomes, compromise us. One exactly caveat comes
running wheel study is, doesn't matter many friends swear stress
management technique. makes want scream head off 10
seconds, not one going work you. read fine print
testimonials, got something works you. Another one stress
management type techniques work, can't save weekend, can't
save stuck hold phone Muzak two minutes.
got something stop virtually, daily every
day, spend 20, 30 minutes it. see coming
like 80/20 rule economics. 80/20, 80% complaints store come
20% customers, things like that. see is, entire life consists


every single thing shoulders, can't say no 24/7. stopped
finally said, wellbeing important enough finally get say no
stuff can't say no to. going every day 20 minutes,
whatever stress management technique 20 minutes sort
knows what, already 80% way simply decided
wellbeing important enough going stop every single day
priority. exactly finding find people chronic
depression untreated merely calling getting appointment see mental
health professional, people start feeling better already evidence
activated, matter enough this, conceive
actually good outcome rather hopeless one. Just something
meditative reflective every day so, hardly even matters one
doing. comes thus another warning, not trust anybody
says, scientifically proven brand stress management works
better ones. Just watch wallet point. - Yeah, amen. think one
core goals lab David Spiegel's lab, know worked
David published papers David well really try find
various entry points thing call autonomic nervous system
stress system, systems gone unchecked really can take us
dark path. idea many entry points really one keeps,
data keep telling us again. no magic breathing tool
exercise, variety one those. And, again, come back idea
one select one make space for, one
hopefully enjoy going work best terms physiology. - [mumbles]
benign people stuck around you.

00:57:04 Power Perception, Choice & Individual Differences

- Right, right, absolutely. brings question of, find amazing
perceive event, whether not chose event not can
incredible different effects circuitry brain circuitry body
biology cells. ways boggles mind, like can decision made
presumably prefrontal cortex, although parts brain well, can
change essentially polarity response body. And, mean, talked


Type personalities there. don't go detail
sake time, interesting effects endothelial cells. mean, literally
size of, [laughs] portals blood opposite direction, depending
whether not somebody wants situation highly motivated person. Maybe
just give us top contour think really illustrates
principle beautifully. maybe would, just speculate
brain might switch turn one experience terrible beneficial
beneficial terrible, really fascinating. - Well, need like tonight
going sleep lying bed nice drowsy
heart's beating nice slow, start thinking fact heart isn't going
beat forever. [Andrew laughs] imagine toes getting cold afterward
imagine flow blood coming halt clotting. going
something physiology point 99% mammals
running frantically. going turning sympathetic
stress response thought, emotions, memory. measure
just much cortex limbic system sends projections
autonomic regulators brain. can think autonomic regulatory neurons
action ways animals can like extremes environmental
circumstances. given autonomic rule, mean, big challenge
understanding gigantic individual differences. that's, talk
optimal amount stress, counts stimulation, general stress not
severe doesn't go long overall benevolence setting.
conditions, love stressed something unexpected
control predictability like really interesting plot turn movie watching.
great, get individual differences somehow accommodate
fact people, perfect stimulatory amount stress like getting
early Audubon birdwatching walk next Sunday morning. somebody else,
signing like mercenary Yemen. [Andrew laughs]

01:00:32 Context-Setting, Prefrontal Cortex & Hierarchy

tremendous individual differences swamp simple prescriptions. - Yeah,
prefrontal cortex, thinking machinery harbor, double-edged
sword. remarkable is, areas brain like hypothalamus


amygdala, sort like switches. mean, context gain
control. talked gain control testosterone, etc., really like
switches. mean, stimulate ventromedial hypothalamus, get right neurons,
animal will try kill even object sitting next it. tickle
neurons, it'll try mate object. mean, really wild. think
probably rules prefrontal cortex also, sounds like context plural
prefrontal cortex can draw probably infinite, probably learn
perceive threat anything. Whether not another group whether not
science whether not somebody's version shape earth versus
another. mean, like, can plug anything system give enough data,
think sounds like drive fear response love response.
overstepping? - [laughs] mixed horribly ambivalent one changing
millisecond, like mutually contradictory. No, absolutely case
prefrontal cortex, regretted like wasted 30 years
life studying hippocampus shoot studied prefrontal cortex
much interesting does, contextual stuff.
ways not okay lie setting, great thing another.
not okay kill unless them, get medal. not,
social context moral relativity situational ethic stuff, prefrontal cortex
got master that. winds meaning place brain
anywhere say perception things can powerfully influence
reality coming you. - Yeah. - mean, great example, just harking back
testosterone. Okay, exercise boosts testosterone levels. exercise
success exercise failure? literature back 80s looking
outcomes marathons. testosterone rise people win
losers? Wrestling matches. Things sort simple prediction answer
wound being, didn't see simple answer. Okay, win marathon, not
necessarily predictor increased testosterone. about? find
like winner testosterone decreases, find guy came 73rd
massive testosterone increase. Whoa, about?
far human subtlety. guy won race decline testosterone
came three minutes later really, really expecting.
everybody now going writing hill. guy
came 73rd boost testosterone assuming dead


heart attack third mile, [Andrew laughs] instead managed finish.
interpretive stuff going there, prefrontal cortex about. -
Amazing, raises question cognitive flexibility, Can tell
something good us even not enjoying it? can wriggle around
corners choosing exercise the... Personally not big fan long bouts
meditation, benefited tremendously things like dedicated breathing
shorter rounds meditation. Can tell good wriggle around
corner get physiology working way want? cognitive
flexibility? Can third place runner tell myself, well, least came in,
wanted win badly. primary goal, another goal beat
previous time, that. so, [laughs] mean, it's... extent can
toggle relationship prefrontal cortex primitive
systems? - Well, enormous amount. example, low hierarchy
generally bad health like every mammal there, including us,
something special, can part multiple hierarchies time.
maybe low ranking one them, extremely high ranking
another, like crappiest job corporation, captain
softball team year company. better bet somebody
going find sorts ways decide nine five Monday Fridays, just stupid
paying bills. really matters prestige weekend. poorer,
deacon church here. can play sorts psychological
games that. One like consistent, reliable ones need
use frontal cortex like crazy is, somebody something rotten need
attribute it. answer is, something wrong, hmm, rotten.
Always always will constitutional explanation. something
rotten somebody, explain afterward? situational one. tired,
stressed sort setting, misunderstood this. best excusing
bad things access inner lives got
prefrontal cortexes great coming situational explanation rather than,
hey, maybe just like selfish rotten human, need change.
prefrontal cortex, every time, don't let somebody merge lane
front us, even though curse somebody thing and...
Endlessly. - love it. statement fact can select multiple
hierarchies participate in. seems like particularly important one nowadays


social media prevalent. know not particularly active social
media although might pleasantly, don't know unpleasantly surprised find
lot positive discussion work, don't even
need there. just continue discuss [laughs] work.
interesting social media found context very, broad. mean,
one argue one selects follow news articles reading,
etc. can create kind funneling information can dangerous.
verification crazy ideas even just less exposure new ideas. also
idea social media incredibly broad context. scroll feed,
no longer like eighth grade classroom office faculty
meeting. exposed thousands, not millions contexts, meal,
soccer game, person's body, person's intellect. YouTube another example.
vast, vast landscape. context completely mishmash whereas assuming
evolved. think evolve contexts much constrained.
interacted limited number individuals limited number different domains,
seasons tended constrain us all. course, got phones televisions,
started expand, now ever, brain, prefrontal cortex
sense exist multiple hierarchies essentially wicked
infinity. think might interacting primitive
systems aspects biology? - Well, think get is, ways
punchline of, human humans, use
exact blueprint, hormones, kinases, receptors,
same, everything built exact stuff species
there, go use completely novel way. usually terms
able abstract stuff space time dramatic ways. So, okay, low
ranking baboon can feel badly just like killed rabbit
eat higher ranking guy boots off takes away you,
feel crummy stressful unhappy. exact
things like brain bodies losing sense self-esteem,
can watching movie character screen feeling inadequate compared
like wonderful attractive are. can somebody driving past us
expensive car, don't even see face, can feel belittled
socioeconomic status. can watch like Lifestyles Rich Famous
read Bezos to. reason, decide life less fulfilling


didn't fly space 11 minutes. can feel miserable
ways no organism can, simply can
meaningful social networks include like party reading Facebook
weren't invited taking place Singapore, don't know
people, nonetheless, somehow means

01:11:20 Dr. Sapolsky Accomplishes Deep Thinking

feel less content turned be. take steps life
actively restrict contexts think live contemplate order
enhance creative life, intellectual life? steps actively take? -
Well, actively don't know make use anything [laughs] social media.
guess counts thus actively chosen not learn how.
case certainly last year half, like lots people, gone stretches
managed sort enforce moratorium looking news,
wonderfully freeing. think larger sense though, addition
neurobiologist, sort spent decades spending part year studying wild
baboons national park East Africa. spend three months year without
electricity, without phone calls, going 12 hours day without saying word
somebody. finally would, somebody nomadic pastoralist guy
different language. Yeah, 90% like insightful thinking anything
laboratory three months year, not one lab, not
inundated stuff. - Well, think shifting trend towards trying create
narrowing context that... like see, niece, 14-years-old
friends good putting phones away. say, not
going phones interaction, especially after... realized still
somewhat this. unclear headed,

01:13:17 Free Will?

2020 restrictive separated friends. Now it's,
really focus together not bring elements phones.
brings great hope generation, [laughs] maybe will...
knows, maybe run off study baboons, need field researchers.


along lines choice, like shift gears slightly talk freewill,
ability make choices all. - Well, personal way left field inflammatory
stance is, don't think shred freewill despite 95% philosophers.
think probably majority neuroscientists saying freewill least
circumstances. don't think all. reason is,
something, behave, make choice, whatever. understand
that, intention come from? Part due like sensory
environment previous minute. hormone levels
bloodstream morning. whether wonderful
stressful last three months sort neuroplasticity happened. Part
hormone levels exposed fetus. Part culture ancestors
came with, thus parented kid.
there, can understand behavior coming without incorporating
those. point, not relevant factors,
ultimately one factor. talking evolution
behavior, definition also talking genetics. talking
genes behavior, definition talking brain
constructed proteins coded for. talking like mood
disorder now, talking sense efficacy getting five-year-
old. intertwined. look influences, basically like
challenge is, show neuron just caused behavior, show network
neurons just caused behavior. show nothing just
influenced anything sensory environment one second ago
evolution species. no space fit freewill concept
winds brain, not brain. simply no wiggle room
there. - can appreciate behaviors choices consequences
long line dominoes fell prior behavior. possible can
intervene domino effect, speak. words, can recognition
fact genes heritability, epigenome that, hormonal context,
historical context. Can knowledge give small shard
freewill? Meaning, allow say, ah, okay, accept choices
somewhat predetermined, yet knowing gives additional layer
control? philosophical biological universe works? - Nah.
can produce wonderfully positive belief change can happen. Even


traumatic change, even worst circumstances, unlikely people, change
can happen, things can change. Don't fatalistic, don't decide
mechanistic, biological machines nothing can ever... Change can happen,
people go off rails translating into, can change ourselves. don't,
can't no freewill. However, can changed circumstance.
point is, like look Aplysia, sea slug learned retract gill
response shock tail, can like conditioning, Pavlovian conditioning
it, learned, behavior changed environment. hear
news something like horrifically depressing going on, refugees wherever.
result, feel little bit helpless less sense efficacy
world, behaviors changed. Okay, okay, yeah, guess that,
remarkable thing is, exact neurobiology. signal transduction
pathways happening sea snail incorporate exact kinases
proteases phosphatases mammalian fear
conditioning, alert, conserved. exact thing, simply
playing obviously much, much fancier domain. learned
change possible despite understanding mechanistically can't change
volitionally, understand change possible, just
changed ability brain respond optimistic stimuli. changed
ability brain now send direction exposed
information will seem cheerful rather depressing. Oh God, amazing,
Nelson Mandela Martin Luther king folks did. Wow,
adverse circumstances, able do. Maybe can also, maybe can go
read people like get even data points change
neurochemistry, responses different now. tilted little bit
direction feeling like can make difference instead damn
hopeless. enormous change can happen, last thing come
view of, nothing less sum biology interactions
environment,

01:20:50 Apply Knowledge & Learning

throw hands say, thus no use trying change anything. -
can acknowledge change extremely hard impossible, circumstances


can change, yet striving better human beings still worthwhile
endeavor. correct? - Absolutely. simply knowledge, either
experience making end right neurobiology class taught
change can happen within framework mechanistic neurobiology.
now open made optimistic good news world around you.
likely inspired that, resistant getting
discouraged bad news, simply now understand possible. - Mm-hmm,
yeah, somebody spent much career working hippocampus,
assume believer neuroplasticity, neural circuits can change
response experience, so-called top-down mechanisms
prefrontal cortex talking can play role there,
decision try change pursuit knowledge pursuit experience
can shape circuitry, therefore make us different machines, speak. - Yeah.
not can say prenatal hormone exposure changed way brain
constructed, learning prenatal hormone exposure can change construction
brain will change brain right now, think
intentions came from. Wow, maybe something it. knowledge
knowledge effector itself. - important powerful
statement hear. think many people think tool, doesn't involve pill
protocol, useless. certainly pills protocols
useful variety context variety things, idea knowledge itself,
whereas put it, knowledge knowledge tool, think important
concept people embed minds. And, listen, grateful discussion
raising topics. think people, many people know work
testosterone, stress, covered today, work freewill
idea hopeless total control. think realizing
listening neither true, solution resides

01:23:44 Robert’s New Book: “Determined: Science Life Without Free Will”

understanding freewill lack it, [laughs] also neuroplasticity.
working book freewill, willing tell us little bit
book process can look forward to? - Yeah,
going really slow. Title is, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill."


essentially first half book trying convince reader, okay, not
no freewill whatsoever, least lot less normally assumed.
going standard arguments freewill, doesn't make sense
21st century science? led reading lot frustrating
philosophers basically willing admit stuff made like atoms
molecules. like physical reality sort world, not just relying
magic, believe freewill magical reasons, doesn't make
sense. Okay, first half book hopefully convince people
much less freewill used think. second half gigantic
juncture built around fact haven't thought freewill since like
adolescent. despite thinking way, still absolutely no idea
supposed function belief. supposed go everyday life
anything feel entitled isn't true? angers hatreds feel aren't justified,
no thing appropriate, blame punishment praise reward,
none makes sense, somebody like even compliments haircut,
conditioned say, oh, thanks, something do.
supposed function that? second half wrestling that,
punchline is, going incredibly hard. think going
hard subtract notion freewill making sense like serial murderers,
going thousand times harder making sense somebody says "good job"
you. [Andrew laughs] exact reality sort
interpretations. going incredibly hard, nonetheless look
history subtracted notion agency sorts realms
blame, starting thinking witches caused hailstorms 500 years ago notion
psychodynamically screwed mothers cause schizophrenia, done it.
done endless number times, able subtract sense volition
understanding world works around us. don't murderers running
amuck street, society hasn't collapsed puddle, fact,
humane society. good news possible done repeatedly
past, going hard hell. hard hell try write
coherently, [laughs] discovering, going slowly. - Well, speak many, many
people say really excited book done will
patiently wait, great excitement book, "Determined". said title,
correct? - Yeah, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill". seems like


can't publish book days without sub-title, it? - Fantastic. Well,
excited read book. grateful conversation today, learned
ton. Every time speak learn, really pleasure delight
interact today previous years, say, colleagues.
thank again, Robert, everything hard, hard work
thinking put work clear put lot hard work

hierarchy. Number one great, number five miserable, number three right
between. Now take number three shoot guy tons testosterone
going involved fights. Aha, testosterone uniformly causes aggression,
look closely pattern it, number three now challenging numbers
two one place hierarchy. Absolutely not, brown-nosing
exactly much used to. going just miserable terror poor
number four five. case, testosterone amplifying
preexisting patterns aggression. Amplifying social learning, it'd gone
there. Now sort reductive level, translate
amygdala? testosterone make amygdaloid neurons action potentials?
cause neurons suddenly speak fear aggression spontaneously?
Absolutely not. is, amygdala already stimulated, increases
rate neuronal firing. worth? shortens after-hyperpolarizations.
theme exactly is, not creating aggression, just upping volume
whatever aggression already there. factor in, impossible say
anything testosterone

00:15:15 Behaviors Affect Testosterone

outside context testosterone related behaviors, get treated [laughs]
social settings. - Mm-hmm, yeah. terms status relationship
individuals, either nonhuman primates humans, can say testosterone
levels testosterone? say, can say relative levels
testosterone individuals correlated status within hierarchy? - Yes,
way winds totally uninteresting. Like go back whatever number
decades, endocrinology texts, two totally reliable findings there.
see, dog that's- - Oh, good, like dogs Huberman Lab
podcast. - Oh, okay, jingling that. - welcome, absolutely
welcome, yeah. - there'd two truisms, higher levels testosterone
predict higher levels aggression humans animals. Higher levels
testosterone predict higher levels sexual activity. Whoa, testosterone causing both,
correlation there. look closely, got cause effect stuff,
sexual behavior raises testosterone levels, aggression raises testosterone levels.
levels barely predictive going happen, response


rather cause. look though terms making sense individual
differences, don't matter whole lot. can spend entire career social
circumstances produce 3.5% testosterone circulation, expect see
sorts interesting implications. not really case, somewhat yes
no modulator much subtle social stuff already there. -
interesting.

00:17:20 Mindsets & Contexts Affect Testosterone

think lot misconceptions human biology, testosterone
seems one area least can find internet, sort
peak misunderstanding. Maybe just ask questions
testosterone sexual behavior interesting story
castration versus non-castration causality, again. address that,
just want highlight something said think vital,
behaviors, aggressive behaviors sexual behaviors can actually increase
testosterone. hear correctly? - Yeah. - reverse sort true, not
causal way. right? - opposite direction causality, yeah. - Yeah, yeah,
increase somebody's testosterone 30%, male female doesn't matter,
sexual behavior may may not change. - Essentially zero effect all. brain
not sensitive fluctuations testosterone levels. terms things like
aggression, raising testosterone, great footnote. right type
willing die trenches devotion sort thing, watching favorite team play
sport will raise testosterone levels sit potato chips
armchair. not physicality aggression, psychological framing it. So,
yeah, testosterone not causing that. great way appreciate is, okay,
testosterone sexual behavior correlations, definitive
endocrine intervention, subtraction study, removed testes.
said before, levels sexual behavior goes down. Good, just shown
testosterone somehow caused it. Critically go down, not zero,
whether rat monkey human, whatever. predicts much
residual sexual behavior there, much sexual behavior
castration? telling behavior carried social
learning context rather hormone, exact thing aggression.


Drops castration, doesn't go zero, prior history it, just
keeps coasting along even without testosterone. - interesting. Can
say exception terms early organizing effects hormones? Like,
instance, developing animal deprived testosterone estrogen
aromatized testosterone estrogen, whole story is, know.
imagine circuits brain responsible initiating sexual
behavior first place might not emerge, therefore not sensitive
testosterone later life. right?

00:20:28 Finger Length Ratios Reflect Prenatal Hormone Levels

Okay. - Yeah, exactly. great way seeing totally nutty biological
factoid, second fourth digit ratio enhanced. - Oh yeah. - Totally obscure
thing, ratio one way reflects levels testosterone, androgen
exposure fetal life. can't remember way goes minuscule
need thousand people sample size able see anything, see
primates, already fetal sonograms, that. readout
subtle differences prenatal exposure, winds predictor whole
range sort stuff adult behavior. So, yeah, fetal end, still
building everything, testosterone amount making huge difference.
time adult, just somewhat old non-signal. - Yeah,
confession, master's student Berkeley Marc Breedlove's
arena, author paper, although deep within author line,
got description exactly right D2, index finger ring finger
ratio similar females males. males, index finger tends
shorter. people listening now freaking
measuring, proper way measure this, is, eyeballing doesn't
work time unless extremes. interesting stories there.
actually replicated no fewer five times, Marc Breedlove tells me.
yes, terms early organizing effects, seem robust studies.
later effects sort activation neural circuits hormones.

00:22:30 Aggression: Male-Female, Female-Male, & Female-Female



absolutely fascinated this. couple questions, is,
normally associate testosterone males, course, females make testosterone
well adrenals presumably elsewhere too. guessing looked hard
enough, probably find sources androgens females. Can
say general contours effects aggression also pertain females?
suppose ask particular female-female aggression,
exist many species, female-male agregression well maternal aggression,
robust aspect evolution, course, mother will, angry mother
animal kind protecting young truly dangerous, best sense word.
- type post-parturition, period birth aggression estrogen,
progesterone, sorts things. Female aggression, rest time
testosterone major player much lower level average. average,
one always say, basically punchlines. females, lower
levels testosterone essential typical levels aggression sexual behavior.
Nonetheless, not causing it, not sensitive small individual differences.
exact thing. can get way over-impressed

00:24:05 Testosterone: Challenge Hypothesis

importance androgens females just readily males. - line
that, conceptualize testosterone? realize isn't single sentence
can capture hormone effects hormones many different
slow fast effects brain, glands own, glands
produce them. heard talk testosterone today years,
start get impression misunderstood molecule [laughs] human
health universe, clearly something powerful. shifting way
certain neural circuits work, adjusting gain amygdala, described,
certainly things well. truism testosterone like,
relationship effort relationship resilience, way maybe will help
people sort think think testosterone? - Yeah. Maybe
three separate answers that. first one is, think fair summary think
comes motivated strong behaviors, testosterone make
whatever already are. me, sexual arousal, libido, aggressiveness,
spontaneous aggression, reactive aggression, things sort. upping volume


things already strongly there. Second way think is, well, like
favorite finding testosterone. wonderful work guy,
John Wingfield, one best behavioral endocrinologists there.
20 years ago formulated called Challenge Hypothesis Testosterone
Action. testosterone do? Testosterone secrete
status challenged, makes likely behaviors
needed hold onto status. Okay, totally boringly straightforward
baboon. somebody challenging high rank, appropriate response
part going aggression. right, just got back door,
testosterone aggression, again. get humans, humans lots
different ways achieving maintaining status. need go like
fancy private school's annual auction, will see half-drunk alpha
males competing see can give money away show conspicuous
like property have. setting like that, mean, haven't able take
urine samples, times, unfortunately, shows flip side it.
species hands status different sort way, testosterone going
boost also. Okay, generates totally nutty prediction. Wow, take people
circumstance, say playing economic game get status trustworthy
generous interactions game. give people testosterone,
make generous? absolutely case. Totally cool
finding. showing you, don't know, basically took whole bunch Buddhist
monks shot testosterone, get competitive
random acts kindness. societal problem
much aggression, first culprit look not testosterone, first look
hand much damn elevated status aggression many
circumstances. find finding fantastic. Third thing subtlety
testosterone. Okay, like subtler behavioral effects, give testosterone
people become confident, become self-confident. Well,
good, people pay take sorts nonsensical self-help courses will boost
self-esteem. good thing unless testosterone makes confident,
inaccurate, likely barrel wrong decisions. shown
economic game play testosterone making confident makes less
cooperative needs cooperate top own.
Testosterone makes people cocky impulsive. might great one setting,


is, absolutely sure army get
country three days. hell, start World War I, get big surprise it.
Testosterone altering risk assessment beforehand probably played big role kind
miscalculation.

00:29:20 Dopamine Impacts Testosterone & Motivation

- Super-interesting. always think testosterone dopamine close cousins
brain, not just relationship pituitary
hypothalamus. That, course, also dopamine's salient role creating
bias towards exteroception. somebody takes drug, increases
dopamine, chockablock full dopamine. tend, want highlight 'tend'
is, really generalizing here, tend focus outward goals,
things beyond boundaries skin. testosterone seems bit
same, tends put us similar mode perceiving outside world ways
asking questions like, relate species? relate
goals? anything can better conceptualize relationship
testosterone dopamine motivation? just take us
alleyways of, neural pathways hypothalamus? fine too. - Well,
think got lots sort massive revisionism dopamine. Everyone,
since pharaohs got brought taught dopamine pleasure
reward. turns isn't, anticipation reward, generating
motivation, goal-directed behavior needed go get reward.
know it, using like elevated dopamine, entire life motivate
whatever going get like entry heaven after-life kind of, sort
thing. really motivation. testosterone even individuals
not aggressive testosterone replacement often helpful thing
aging males increases energy, increases sense thereness, presence
alertness increases motivation. whole aspect, takes us
motivation get like go, hand lots soup soup kitchen
homeless people, get go ethnically cleanse village. got much
makeup testosterone got onboard. activating
energetic sense, testosterone within minutes increases glucose uptake skeletal
muscle. just awake alert that, lot


dopamine does. one might predict then, getting just right levels
testosterone infused bloodstream feels great lab rats. will lever press
get infused range optimizes dopamine release. is,
absolutely right, deeply intertwined. - Yeah, beautiful biology there.

00:32:32 Estrogen: Improves Brain & Longevity TIMING KEY

love way encapsulate relationship. want ask estrogen,
don't hear estrogen often, always interesting now
public facing education, testosterone controversial molecule, just say
almost controversial. [laughs] [Robert laughs] estrogen doesn't seem hold
controversial weight, yet estrogen powerful effects
animal brain human brain males females. Men not want
estrogen go low. Terrible things happen, will lose cognitive function, libido
can drop. men need estrogen well, perhaps maybe can put filter
estrogen testosterone. general themes estrogen
people aware think generally misunderstood? really
feelings empathy making us sensitive? sense not. - No,
context dependent. estrogen giving birth playing central
role wanting shred face somebody getting close kittens kind
thing, know not just warm, fuzzy, empathic kind stuff. Estrogen lots
ways summarized by, got choice matter lot
estrogen bloodstream not, go lot estrogen. enhances
cognition, exactly said, stimulates neurogenesis hippocampus,
increases glucose oxygen delivery, protects dementia, decreases
inflammatory oxidative damage blood vessels, good protecting
cardiovascular disease contrast testosterone, making everyone
things worse. springs minefield question, is,
post-menopausal estrogen? sorts lab studies non-human primates
suggested keep estrogen levels high monkey's equivalent
menopause. going keep brain health lot better decreasing risk
dementia, stroke, every thing. Estrogen great antioxidant, that.
90s think Healy, forgetting name, first female
head NIH, Bernadine Healy set massive prospective human study,


going biggest one times, looking pluses minuses post-
menopausal estrogen. tens thousands women, was...
cut study short seeing was, estrogen not
normal bad stuff expect terms decalcification stuff,
increasing risk cardiovascular disease, increasing risk stroke,
increasing risk dementia. ground halt everybody,
stopped study front page news everybody panned point. nobody
make sense spending last 20 years studying exact
thing primates seeing protective effects. explanation turned
one things like law unexpected consequences. Okay,
menopause women, lasts different lengths time, may factor going
come. know what, not start giving study subjects estrogen
totally past menopause. got lag time between, shift
sorts estrogen receptor patterns, bad effects come from.
- Wow! - monkey studies involved just maintaining ovulatory levels
post-menopausal period. get great effects. Estrogen one
greatest predictors protection Alzheimer's disease, that, needs
physiological. Just keep continuing body long time
versus let whole thing shutdown suddenly like try fire coal stoves
bottom basement kind thing, get going, get utterly different
outcomes. caused lot human health consequences people suddenly
decided estrogen fact neurologically endangering post-menopausally. - Wow,
fascinating. never thought steroid hormone receptors not
binding estrogen, devoid estrogen binding, say, set off
opposite biochemical cascades. Fascinating. guess raises question
testosterone replacement too, whether not people [laughs] talk doctor
long. Men women talk physicians long avoid these,
whatever happening periods isn't sufficient testosterone and/or
estrogen. sounds like cause longer-term problems even therapies
introduced. - Two additional misery slash complications. So, okay, trying
understand, look women history without post-menopausal estrogen
replacement done great. seeing 20 years later, estrogen
predictor decreased risk Alzheimer's. got start trying
unpacking prospective type studies. much estrogen? times? Estrogen


catchall term bunch hormones, estrone, estradiol, estriol. much one
them? Natural synthetic? Go try figure out. second
complication is, often hard say anything estrogen outside
context progesterone doing. often not absolute levels either,
ratio two. complicated endocrine system
testosterone. generate dramatic cyclicity like no male
hypothalamus ever dream off. much, much complicated system, thus,
lot complicated understand,

00:39:40 Testosterone & Sperm Counts Males Really Dropping?

let alone like figure ideal benefits it. - Yeah. don't know
make literature dropping rates testosterone endocrine disruptors.
Berkeley Tyrone Hayes published data frogs drinking
water various locations throughout United States, not just California,
seeing severe endocrine disruption blockade or, androgen receptors
sorts issues. hear time now sperm counts
dropping, endocrine disruptors birth control
water, drinking water. starts sound little crazy, yet also
fooled by, guess good example be, lot crazy stuff
world online terrible stuff highly processed foods. yet got
respectable people, endocrinologists UCSF like Robert Lustig saying, yeah, lot
hidden sugars emulsifiers, causing real problems.
become open-minded question. so, suffering drops
sperm counts testosterone estrogen fertility consequence endocrine
disruptors environments food, social reasons? anything
can hang hat like real data confident in? just mess? -
No, phenomenon appear quite real. Cross-sectional studies, human
populations, still don't understand one first things Hayes
spotted. Decreasing testicle size crocodiles. [Andrew laughs] Go figure
one first contributions this. think phenomenon absolutely real.
left two classic challenges, correlated
something broad environmental toxins. ones, much, when, etc.?
one always being, well, okay, dropping dropping enough make difference.


big effect this? juries still out. - Yeah,
area know lot interest in, got groups people won't
touch receipt store BPAs inks the...
[laughs] got people don't care things. fascinating area.

00:42:15 Stress Mitigation & Sense Control

hope biology will done soon. like briefly return stress.
described study two rats, one running wheel voluntarily, one
basically stuck running wheel, forced run anytime, rat number one runs.
one case rat voluntarily exercising. [laughs] case, rat
forced go PE class, speak, really, seeing divergent effects
biology. like just touch use kind case study stress
mitigation general. rather obsessed colleague, David Spiegel, Associate
Chair Psychiatry Stanford obsessed question of, humans can start
mitigate stress? think stress mitigation
individuals families culture try encourage people
mitigate stress, ways not going turn us rat number two,
forced mitigate stress therefore becomes stressful.
[laughs] - see is, rat number one gets benefits exercise. Rat
number two gets downsides severe stress exact muscle
expenditure movements going on. Perfectly yoked, great example
interpretation head. haven't kept literature, bet you, rat
number two whole lot activity amygdala rat number one.
Okay, stress mitigation. Anything say preface with,
reasonably good telling people going happen don't manage
stress, terrible actually like managing stress advising manage that.
much better bad news aspect it. see is, now just classic
literature, half century old, sort showing building blocks stress. Not,
ooh, step outside gored elephant, can grow
experience? doesn't kill makes stronger.
stress response, realm gray zone ambiguous social
interactions, sort thing. people massive stress responses, others not
all, between, enjoy it. Like building blocks of, makes


psychological stress stressful? first one exactly brought
running study. sense control? sense control makes stressors less
stressful. running wheel shows studies you, lab rat
college freshman volunteer trained pressing lever, less likely
get shock. today lever working away unbeknownst
lever turned off, no effect shock frequency,
think control, less stress response. rat
day-in day-out, less likely get ulcer. sense
control. related sense predictability. Rat get shocked, human gets
shocked, whatever, scenario either shocks come now then,
shocks come now then, 10 seconds little warning light comes on.
get warning light, shocks distressful. got predictability
not getting warning lights, second half second away
next shock. get warning light, know isn't one, got
least 10 seconds worth relaxation. know coming, can prepare
coping responses, best afterward know finally safe,
can recover it. enormously protective. Others outlet frustration,
take rat getting shocked, run running wheel,
protective thing, voluntarily. got rat can gnaw bar
wood, stressor less stressful. Unfortunately, rat primate human
stressed, ability aggressively dump somebody smaller weaker
also reduces stress response. fact displacement aggression reduces
stress accounts huge percent triggers like unhappiness.
variables, get social support well. good one. Interpreting circumstances
good news rather bad. Hurray, got simple sort like take
home recipe go get much control much predictability many
outlets much social support possible, going just fine.
go that, recipe total disaster much, much
subtle that. one great example, okay, getting shocks, want
warning beforehand, get little warning light 10 seconds shock,
wonderfully protective. Get warning light one second shock doesn't
anything. not enough time get psychological benefits
anticipation. Now instead, gets little warning coming two minutes
shock, going make things worse not going sitting


like reveling sort sense predictability, soon going be, oh.
going sitting two minutes saying, damn, comes. Predictive
information works narrow domain. Similarly, control. want
sense control face stress? answer is, mild moderate
stressor happening then, sense control completely
independent reality whether control not, face mild
moderate stressors, sense control gets interpreted as, wow, look much worse
things been. Thank God, control, top master fate.
contrast, major stressor, arbitrary sense control make
think, oh God, look much better been. prevented it.
know intuitively like face people's worst stressors.
Nobody stopped car way kids suddenly jumped out. wouldn't
mattered gotten doctor month ago, instead now,
wouldn't made any... didn't actually control. see is,
absolutely want huge sense control mild moderate stressors,
especially ones result good outcome. Hooray, me, face horrible
stressors, want like self-deception, like truth beauty don't
necessarily go hand-in-hand point. stress management techniques
impact control predictability wind far worse neutral preaching
somebody homeless somebody terminal cancer, somebody
refugee. Tell neurotic middle-class person psychological tools
turn hell heaven. truth that. thing somebody
going real hell, just privileged heartlessness
doesn't work. outlets, outlets damaging,
not good way mitigate stress. Social support, confusing mere
acquaintances real social support, going rug pulled
point. mistaking social support being, going bitching
moaning demanding supportiveness everyone around rather
reciprocally, not going work well either. not simple.
not nothing lots us really lousy. It, like good friends things
like that, takes lot work right? wrong may
temporarily seem like great thing, turns completely misplaced
faith, going feeling worse started.



00:51:35 Best Buffer Stress

- Interesting. days, lot interest using physical practices mitigate
stress, trying get ruminating, extent take control neural
circuits brain using exercise using breathing hypnosis. And, course,
hypnosis mental component well. thoughts stress mitigation
standpoint of, okay, don't want rat number two, want select
something ourselves, take initiative ourselves. forced
exercising not, actually negative health effect perhaps. need
pick something like, need take control it. terms supporting
people, touched bit. best way support people?
talk stressful thing? mean, not asking play psychologist here,
find divergent data this. can spin lather ruminating
something. language seems like wonderful tool, also fairly
deprived tool doesn't really get core physiology like something
like breathing would. thoughts more, lack better way put
it, head-centered, cognitive approaches stress mitigation versus kind going
core physiology. Cold showers now even thing extent just get
people stress acclimated, voluntarily taking cold showers. - makes sense
physiologically, preconditioning real stressors come. terms
bring up, oh, transcendental meditation, mindfulness, exercise, prayer, sort reflecting
gratitude, sort thing. Collectively work average, work
terms of, can lower heart rate cholesterol levels sorts good
outcomes, compromise us. One exactly caveat comes
running wheel study is, doesn't matter many friends swear stress
management technique. makes want scream head off 10
seconds, not one going work you. read fine print
testimonials, got something works you. Another one stress
management type techniques work, can't save weekend, can't
save stuck hold phone Muzak two minutes.
got something stop virtually, daily every
day, spend 20, 30 minutes it. see coming
like 80/20 rule economics. 80/20, 80% complaints store come
20% customers, things like that. see is, entire life consists


every single thing shoulders, can't say no 24/7. stopped
finally said, wellbeing important enough finally get say no
stuff can't say no to. going every day 20 minutes,
whatever stress management technique 20 minutes sort
knows what, already 80% way simply decided
wellbeing important enough going stop every single day
priority. exactly finding find people chronic
depression untreated merely calling getting appointment see mental
health professional, people start feeling better already evidence
activated, matter enough this, conceive
actually good outcome rather hopeless one. Just something
meditative reflective every day so, hardly even matters one
doing. comes thus another warning, not trust anybody
says, scientifically proven brand stress management works
better ones. Just watch wallet point. - Yeah, amen. think one
core goals lab David Spiegel's lab, know worked
David published papers David well really try find
various entry points thing call autonomic nervous system
stress system, systems gone unchecked really can take us
dark path. idea many entry points really one keeps,
data keep telling us again. no magic breathing tool
exercise, variety one those. And, again, come back idea
one select one make space for, one
hopefully enjoy going work best terms physiology. - [mumbles]
benign people stuck around you.

00:57:04 Power Perception, Choice & Individual Differences

- Right, right, absolutely. brings question of, find amazing
perceive event, whether not chose event not can
incredible different effects circuitry brain circuitry body
biology cells. ways boggles mind, like can decision made
presumably prefrontal cortex, although parts brain well, can
change essentially polarity response body. And, mean, talked


Type personalities there. don't go detail
sake time, interesting effects endothelial cells. mean, literally
size of, [laughs] portals blood opposite direction, depending
whether not somebody wants situation highly motivated person. Maybe
just give us top contour think really illustrates
principle beautifully. maybe would, just speculate
brain might switch turn one experience terrible beneficial
beneficial terrible, really fascinating. - Well, need like tonight
going sleep lying bed nice drowsy
heart's beating nice slow, start thinking fact heart isn't going
beat forever. [Andrew laughs] imagine toes getting cold afterward
imagine flow blood coming halt clotting. going
something physiology point 99% mammals
running frantically. going turning sympathetic
stress response thought, emotions, memory. measure
just much cortex limbic system sends projections
autonomic regulators brain. can think autonomic regulatory neurons
action ways animals can like extremes environmental
circumstances. given autonomic rule, mean, big challenge
understanding gigantic individual differences. that's, talk
optimal amount stress, counts stimulation, general stress not
severe doesn't go long overall benevolence setting.
conditions, love stressed something unexpected
control predictability like really interesting plot turn movie watching.
great, get individual differences somehow accommodate
fact people, perfect stimulatory amount stress like getting
early Audubon birdwatching walk next Sunday morning. somebody else,
signing like mercenary Yemen. [Andrew laughs]

01:00:32 Context-Setting, Prefrontal Cortex & Hierarchy

tremendous individual differences swamp simple prescriptions. - Yeah,
prefrontal cortex, thinking machinery harbor, double-edged
sword. remarkable is, areas brain like hypothalamus


amygdala, sort like switches. mean, context gain
control. talked gain control testosterone, etc., really like
switches. mean, stimulate ventromedial hypothalamus, get right neurons,
animal will try kill even object sitting next it. tickle
neurons, it'll try mate object. mean, really wild. think
probably rules prefrontal cortex also, sounds like context plural
prefrontal cortex can draw probably infinite, probably learn
perceive threat anything. Whether not another group whether not
science whether not somebody's version shape earth versus
another. mean, like, can plug anything system give enough data,
think sounds like drive fear response love response.
overstepping? - [laughs] mixed horribly ambivalent one changing
millisecond, like mutually contradictory. No, absolutely case
prefrontal cortex, regretted like wasted 30 years
life studying hippocampus shoot studied prefrontal cortex
much interesting does, contextual stuff.
ways not okay lie setting, great thing another.
not okay kill unless them, get medal. not,
social context moral relativity situational ethic stuff, prefrontal cortex
got master that. winds meaning place brain
anywhere say perception things can powerfully influence
reality coming you. - Yeah. - mean, great example, just harking back
testosterone. Okay, exercise boosts testosterone levels. exercise
success exercise failure? literature back 80s looking
outcomes marathons. testosterone rise people win
losers? Wrestling matches. Things sort simple prediction answer
wound being, didn't see simple answer. Okay, win marathon, not
necessarily predictor increased testosterone. about? find
like winner testosterone decreases, find guy came 73rd
massive testosterone increase. Whoa, about?
far human subtlety. guy won race decline testosterone
came three minutes later really, really expecting.
everybody now going writing hill. guy
came 73rd boost testosterone assuming dead


heart attack third mile, [Andrew laughs] instead managed finish.
interpretive stuff going there, prefrontal cortex about. -
Amazing, raises question cognitive flexibility, Can tell
something good us even not enjoying it? can wriggle around
corners choosing exercise the... Personally not big fan long bouts
meditation, benefited tremendously things like dedicated breathing
shorter rounds meditation. Can tell good wriggle around
corner get physiology working way want? cognitive
flexibility? Can third place runner tell myself, well, least came in,
wanted win badly. primary goal, another goal beat
previous time, that. so, [laughs] mean, it's... extent can
toggle relationship prefrontal cortex primitive
systems? - Well, enormous amount. example, low hierarchy
generally bad health like every mammal there, including us,
something special, can part multiple hierarchies time.
maybe low ranking one them, extremely high ranking
another, like crappiest job corporation, captain
softball team year company. better bet somebody
going find sorts ways decide nine five Monday Fridays, just stupid
paying bills. really matters prestige weekend. poorer,
deacon church here. can play sorts psychological
games that. One like consistent, reliable ones need
use frontal cortex like crazy is, somebody something rotten need
attribute it. answer is, something wrong, hmm, rotten.
Always always will constitutional explanation. something
rotten somebody, explain afterward? situational one. tired,
stressed sort setting, misunderstood this. best excusing
bad things access inner lives got
prefrontal cortexes great coming situational explanation rather than,
hey, maybe just like selfish rotten human, need change.
prefrontal cortex, every time, don't let somebody merge lane
front us, even though curse somebody thing and...
Endlessly. - love it. statement fact can select multiple
hierarchies participate in. seems like particularly important one nowadays


social media prevalent. know not particularly active social
media although might pleasantly, don't know unpleasantly surprised find
lot positive discussion work, don't even
need there. just continue discuss [laughs] work.
interesting social media found context very, broad. mean,
one argue one selects follow news articles reading,
etc. can create kind funneling information can dangerous.
verification crazy ideas even just less exposure new ideas. also
idea social media incredibly broad context. scroll feed,
no longer like eighth grade classroom office faculty
meeting. exposed thousands, not millions contexts, meal,
soccer game, person's body, person's intellect. YouTube another example.
vast, vast landscape. context completely mishmash whereas assuming
evolved. think evolve contexts much constrained.
interacted limited number individuals limited number different domains,
seasons tended constrain us all. course, got phones televisions,
started expand, now ever, brain, prefrontal cortex
sense exist multiple hierarchies essentially wicked
infinity. think might interacting primitive
systems aspects biology? - Well, think get is, ways
punchline of, human humans, use
exact blueprint, hormones, kinases, receptors,
same, everything built exact stuff species
there, go use completely novel way. usually terms
able abstract stuff space time dramatic ways. So, okay, low
ranking baboon can feel badly just like killed rabbit
eat higher ranking guy boots off takes away you,
feel crummy stressful unhappy. exact
things like brain bodies losing sense self-esteem,
can watching movie character screen feeling inadequate compared
like wonderful attractive are. can somebody driving past us
expensive car, don't even see face, can feel belittled
socioeconomic status. can watch like Lifestyles Rich Famous
read Bezos to. reason, decide life less fulfilling


didn't fly space 11 minutes. can feel miserable
ways no organism can, simply can
meaningful social networks include like party reading Facebook
weren't invited taking place Singapore, don't know
people, nonetheless, somehow means

01:11:20 Dr. Sapolsky Accomplishes Deep Thinking

feel less content turned be. take steps life
actively restrict contexts think live contemplate order
enhance creative life, intellectual life? steps actively take? -
Well, actively don't know make use anything [laughs] social media.
guess counts thus actively chosen not learn how.
case certainly last year half, like lots people, gone stretches
managed sort enforce moratorium looking news,
wonderfully freeing. think larger sense though, addition
neurobiologist, sort spent decades spending part year studying wild
baboons national park East Africa. spend three months year without
electricity, without phone calls, going 12 hours day without saying word
somebody. finally would, somebody nomadic pastoralist guy
different language. Yeah, 90% like insightful thinking anything
laboratory three months year, not one lab, not
inundated stuff. - Well, think shifting trend towards trying create
narrowing context that... like see, niece, 14-years-old
friends good putting phones away. say, not
going phones interaction, especially after... realized still
somewhat this. unclear headed,

01:13:17 Free Will?

2020 restrictive separated friends. Now it's,
really focus together not bring elements phones.
brings great hope generation, [laughs] maybe will...
knows, maybe run off study baboons, need field researchers.


along lines choice, like shift gears slightly talk freewill,
ability make choices all. - Well, personal way left field inflammatory
stance is, don't think shred freewill despite 95% philosophers.
think probably majority neuroscientists saying freewill least
circumstances. don't think all. reason is,
something, behave, make choice, whatever. understand
that, intention come from? Part due like sensory
environment previous minute. hormone levels
bloodstream morning. whether wonderful
stressful last three months sort neuroplasticity happened. Part
hormone levels exposed fetus. Part culture ancestors
came with, thus parented kid.
there, can understand behavior coming without incorporating
those. point, not relevant factors,
ultimately one factor. talking evolution
behavior, definition also talking genetics. talking
genes behavior, definition talking brain
constructed proteins coded for. talking like mood
disorder now, talking sense efficacy getting five-year-
old. intertwined. look influences, basically like
challenge is, show neuron just caused behavior, show network
neurons just caused behavior. show nothing just
influenced anything sensory environment one second ago
evolution species. no space fit freewill concept
winds brain, not brain. simply no wiggle room
there. - can appreciate behaviors choices consequences
long line dominoes fell prior behavior. possible can
intervene domino effect, speak. words, can recognition
fact genes heritability, epigenome that, hormonal context,
historical context. Can knowledge give small shard
freewill? Meaning, allow say, ah, okay, accept choices
somewhat predetermined, yet knowing gives additional layer
control? philosophical biological universe works? - Nah.
can produce wonderfully positive belief change can happen. Even


traumatic change, even worst circumstances, unlikely people, change
can happen, things can change. Don't fatalistic, don't decide
mechanistic, biological machines nothing can ever... Change can happen,
people go off rails translating into, can change ourselves. don't,
can't no freewill. However, can changed circumstance.
point is, like look Aplysia, sea slug learned retract gill
response shock tail, can like conditioning, Pavlovian conditioning
it, learned, behavior changed environment. hear
news something like horrifically depressing going on, refugees wherever.
result, feel little bit helpless less sense efficacy
world, behaviors changed. Okay, okay, yeah, guess that,
remarkable thing is, exact neurobiology. signal transduction
pathways happening sea snail incorporate exact kinases
proteases phosphatases mammalian fear
conditioning, alert, conserved. exact thing, simply
playing obviously much, much fancier domain. learned
change possible despite understanding mechanistically can't change
volitionally, understand change possible, just
changed ability brain respond optimistic stimuli. changed
ability brain now send direction exposed
information will seem cheerful rather depressing. Oh God, amazing,
Nelson Mandela Martin Luther king folks did. Wow,
adverse circumstances, able do. Maybe can also, maybe can go
read people like get even data points change
neurochemistry, responses different now. tilted little bit
direction feeling like can make difference instead damn
hopeless. enormous change can happen, last thing come
view of, nothing less sum biology interactions
environment,

01:20:50 Apply Knowledge & Learning

throw hands say, thus no use trying change anything. -
can acknowledge change extremely hard impossible, circumstances


can change, yet striving better human beings still worthwhile
endeavor. correct? - Absolutely. simply knowledge, either
experience making end right neurobiology class taught
change can happen within framework mechanistic neurobiology.
now open made optimistic good news world around you.
likely inspired that, resistant getting
discouraged bad news, simply now understand possible. - Mm-hmm,
yeah, somebody spent much career working hippocampus,
assume believer neuroplasticity, neural circuits can change
response experience, so-called top-down mechanisms
prefrontal cortex talking can play role there,
decision try change pursuit knowledge pursuit experience
can shape circuitry, therefore make us different machines, speak. - Yeah.
not can say prenatal hormone exposure changed way brain
constructed, learning prenatal hormone exposure can change construction
brain will change brain right now, think
intentions came from. Wow, maybe something it. knowledge
knowledge effector itself. - important powerful
statement hear. think many people think tool, doesn't involve pill
protocol, useless. certainly pills protocols
useful variety context variety things, idea knowledge itself,
whereas put it, knowledge knowledge tool, think important
concept people embed minds. And, listen, grateful discussion
raising topics. think people, many people know work
testosterone, stress, covered today, work freewill
idea hopeless total control. think realizing
listening neither true, solution resides

01:23:44 Robert’s New Book: “Determined: Science Life Without Free Will”

understanding freewill lack it, [laughs] also neuroplasticity.
working book freewill, willing tell us little bit
book process can look forward to? - Yeah,
going really slow. Title is, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill."


essentially first half book trying convince reader, okay, not
no freewill whatsoever, least lot less normally assumed.
going standard arguments freewill, doesn't make sense
21st century science? led reading lot frustrating
philosophers basically willing admit stuff made like atoms
molecules. like physical reality sort world, not just relying
magic, believe freewill magical reasons, doesn't make
sense. Okay, first half book hopefully convince people
much less freewill used think. second half gigantic
juncture built around fact haven't thought freewill since like
adolescent. despite thinking way, still absolutely no idea
supposed function belief. supposed go everyday life
anything feel entitled isn't true? angers hatreds feel aren't justified,
no thing appropriate, blame punishment praise reward,
none makes sense, somebody like even compliments haircut,
conditioned say, oh, thanks, something do.
supposed function that? second half wrestling that,
punchline is, going incredibly hard. think going
hard subtract notion freewill making sense like serial murderers,
going thousand times harder making sense somebody says "good job"
you. [Andrew laughs] exact reality sort
interpretations. going incredibly hard, nonetheless look
history subtracted notion agency sorts realms
blame, starting thinking witches caused hailstorms 500 years ago notion
psychodynamically screwed mothers cause schizophrenia, done it.
done endless number times, able subtract sense volition
understanding world works around us. don't murderers running
amuck street, society hasn't collapsed puddle, fact,
humane society. good news possible done repeatedly
past, going hard hell. hard hell try write
coherently, [laughs] discovering, going slowly. - Well, speak many, many
people say really excited book done will
patiently wait, great excitement book, "Determined". said title,
correct? - Yeah, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill". seems like


can't publish book days without sub-title, it? - Fantastic. Well,
excited read book. grateful conversation today, learned
ton. Every time speak learn, really pleasure delight
interact today previous years, say, colleagues.
thank again, Robert, everything hard, hard work
thinking put work clear put lot hard work

rather cause. look though terms making sense individual
differences, don't matter whole lot. can spend entire career social
circumstances produce 3.5% testosterone circulation, expect see
sorts interesting implications. not really case, somewhat yes
no modulator much subtle social stuff already there. -
interesting.

00:17:20 Mindsets & Contexts Affect Testosterone

think lot misconceptions human biology, testosterone
seems one area least can find internet, sort
peak misunderstanding. Maybe just ask questions
testosterone sexual behavior interesting story
castration versus non-castration causality, again. address that,
just want highlight something said think vital,
behaviors, aggressive behaviors sexual behaviors can actually increase
testosterone. hear correctly? - Yeah. - reverse sort true, not
causal way. right? - opposite direction causality, yeah. - Yeah, yeah,
increase somebody's testosterone 30%, male female doesn't matter,
sexual behavior may may not change. - Essentially zero effect all. brain
not sensitive fluctuations testosterone levels. terms things like
aggression, raising testosterone, great footnote. right type
willing die trenches devotion sort thing, watching favorite team play
sport will raise testosterone levels sit potato chips
armchair. not physicality aggression, psychological framing it. So,
yeah, testosterone not causing that. great way appreciate is, okay,
testosterone sexual behavior correlations, definitive
endocrine intervention, subtraction study, removed testes.
said before, levels sexual behavior goes down. Good, just shown
testosterone somehow caused it. Critically go down, not zero,
whether rat monkey human, whatever. predicts much
residual sexual behavior there, much sexual behavior
castration? telling behavior carried social
learning context rather hormone, exact thing aggression.


Drops castration, doesn't go zero, prior history it, just
keeps coasting along even without testosterone. - interesting. Can
say exception terms early organizing effects hormones? Like,
instance, developing animal deprived testosterone estrogen
aromatized testosterone estrogen, whole story is, know.
imagine circuits brain responsible initiating sexual
behavior first place might not emerge, therefore not sensitive
testosterone later life. right?

00:20:28 Finger Length Ratios Reflect Prenatal Hormone Levels

Okay. - Yeah, exactly. great way seeing totally nutty biological
factoid, second fourth digit ratio enhanced. - Oh yeah. - Totally obscure
thing, ratio one way reflects levels testosterone, androgen
exposure fetal life. can't remember way goes minuscule
need thousand people sample size able see anything, see
primates, already fetal sonograms, that. readout
subtle differences prenatal exposure, winds predictor whole
range sort stuff adult behavior. So, yeah, fetal end, still
building everything, testosterone amount making huge difference.
time adult, just somewhat old non-signal. - Yeah,
confession, master's student Berkeley Marc Breedlove's
arena, author paper, although deep within author line,
got description exactly right D2, index finger ring finger
ratio similar females males. males, index finger tends
shorter. people listening now freaking
measuring, proper way measure this, is, eyeballing doesn't
work time unless extremes. interesting stories there.
actually replicated no fewer five times, Marc Breedlove tells me.
yes, terms early organizing effects, seem robust studies.
later effects sort activation neural circuits hormones.

00:22:30 Aggression: Male-Female, Female-Male, & Female-Female



absolutely fascinated this. couple questions, is,
normally associate testosterone males, course, females make testosterone
well adrenals presumably elsewhere too. guessing looked hard
enough, probably find sources androgens females. Can
say general contours effects aggression also pertain females?
suppose ask particular female-female aggression,
exist many species, female-male agregression well maternal aggression,
robust aspect evolution, course, mother will, angry mother
animal kind protecting young truly dangerous, best sense word.
- type post-parturition, period birth aggression estrogen,
progesterone, sorts things. Female aggression, rest time
testosterone major player much lower level average. average,
one always say, basically punchlines. females, lower
levels testosterone essential typical levels aggression sexual behavior.
Nonetheless, not causing it, not sensitive small individual differences.
exact thing. can get way over-impressed

00:24:05 Testosterone: Challenge Hypothesis

importance androgens females just readily males. - line
that, conceptualize testosterone? realize isn't single sentence
can capture hormone effects hormones many different
slow fast effects brain, glands own, glands
produce them. heard talk testosterone today years,
start get impression misunderstood molecule [laughs] human
health universe, clearly something powerful. shifting way
certain neural circuits work, adjusting gain amygdala, described,
certainly things well. truism testosterone like,
relationship effort relationship resilience, way maybe will help
people sort think think testosterone? - Yeah. Maybe
three separate answers that. first one is, think fair summary think
comes motivated strong behaviors, testosterone make
whatever already are. me, sexual arousal, libido, aggressiveness,
spontaneous aggression, reactive aggression, things sort. upping volume


things already strongly there. Second way think is, well, like
favorite finding testosterone. wonderful work guy,
John Wingfield, one best behavioral endocrinologists there.
20 years ago formulated called Challenge Hypothesis Testosterone
Action. testosterone do? Testosterone secrete
status challenged, makes likely behaviors
needed hold onto status. Okay, totally boringly straightforward
baboon. somebody challenging high rank, appropriate response
part going aggression. right, just got back door,
testosterone aggression, again. get humans, humans lots
different ways achieving maintaining status. need go like
fancy private school's annual auction, will see half-drunk alpha
males competing see can give money away show conspicuous
like property have. setting like that, mean, haven't able take
urine samples, times, unfortunately, shows flip side it.
species hands status different sort way, testosterone going
boost also. Okay, generates totally nutty prediction. Wow, take people
circumstance, say playing economic game get status trustworthy
generous interactions game. give people testosterone,
make generous? absolutely case. Totally cool
finding. showing you, don't know, basically took whole bunch Buddhist
monks shot testosterone, get competitive
random acts kindness. societal problem
much aggression, first culprit look not testosterone, first look
hand much damn elevated status aggression many
circumstances. find finding fantastic. Third thing subtlety
testosterone. Okay, like subtler behavioral effects, give testosterone
people become confident, become self-confident. Well,
good, people pay take sorts nonsensical self-help courses will boost
self-esteem. good thing unless testosterone makes confident,
inaccurate, likely barrel wrong decisions. shown
economic game play testosterone making confident makes less
cooperative needs cooperate top own.
Testosterone makes people cocky impulsive. might great one setting,


is, absolutely sure army get
country three days. hell, start World War I, get big surprise it.
Testosterone altering risk assessment beforehand probably played big role kind
miscalculation.

00:29:20 Dopamine Impacts Testosterone & Motivation

- Super-interesting. always think testosterone dopamine close cousins
brain, not just relationship pituitary
hypothalamus. That, course, also dopamine's salient role creating
bias towards exteroception. somebody takes drug, increases
dopamine, chockablock full dopamine. tend, want highlight 'tend'
is, really generalizing here, tend focus outward goals,
things beyond boundaries skin. testosterone seems bit
same, tends put us similar mode perceiving outside world ways
asking questions like, relate species? relate
goals? anything can better conceptualize relationship
testosterone dopamine motivation? just take us
alleyways of, neural pathways hypothalamus? fine too. - Well,
think got lots sort massive revisionism dopamine. Everyone,
since pharaohs got brought taught dopamine pleasure
reward. turns isn't, anticipation reward, generating
motivation, goal-directed behavior needed go get reward.
know it, using like elevated dopamine, entire life motivate
whatever going get like entry heaven after-life kind of, sort
thing. really motivation. testosterone even individuals
not aggressive testosterone replacement often helpful thing
aging males increases energy, increases sense thereness, presence
alertness increases motivation. whole aspect, takes us
motivation get like go, hand lots soup soup kitchen
homeless people, get go ethnically cleanse village. got much
makeup testosterone got onboard. activating
energetic sense, testosterone within minutes increases glucose uptake skeletal
muscle. just awake alert that, lot


dopamine does. one might predict then, getting just right levels
testosterone infused bloodstream feels great lab rats. will lever press
get infused range optimizes dopamine release. is,
absolutely right, deeply intertwined. - Yeah, beautiful biology there.

00:32:32 Estrogen: Improves Brain & Longevity TIMING KEY

love way encapsulate relationship. want ask estrogen,
don't hear estrogen often, always interesting now
public facing education, testosterone controversial molecule, just say
almost controversial. [laughs] [Robert laughs] estrogen doesn't seem hold
controversial weight, yet estrogen powerful effects
animal brain human brain males females. Men not want
estrogen go low. Terrible things happen, will lose cognitive function, libido
can drop. men need estrogen well, perhaps maybe can put filter
estrogen testosterone. general themes estrogen
people aware think generally misunderstood? really
feelings empathy making us sensitive? sense not. - No,
context dependent. estrogen giving birth playing central
role wanting shred face somebody getting close kittens kind
thing, know not just warm, fuzzy, empathic kind stuff. Estrogen lots
ways summarized by, got choice matter lot
estrogen bloodstream not, go lot estrogen. enhances
cognition, exactly said, stimulates neurogenesis hippocampus,
increases glucose oxygen delivery, protects dementia, decreases
inflammatory oxidative damage blood vessels, good protecting
cardiovascular disease contrast testosterone, making everyone
things worse. springs minefield question, is,
post-menopausal estrogen? sorts lab studies non-human primates
suggested keep estrogen levels high monkey's equivalent
menopause. going keep brain health lot better decreasing risk
dementia, stroke, every thing. Estrogen great antioxidant, that.
90s think Healy, forgetting name, first female
head NIH, Bernadine Healy set massive prospective human study,


going biggest one times, looking pluses minuses post-
menopausal estrogen. tens thousands women, was...
cut study short seeing was, estrogen not
normal bad stuff expect terms decalcification stuff,
increasing risk cardiovascular disease, increasing risk stroke,
increasing risk dementia. ground halt everybody,
stopped study front page news everybody panned point. nobody
make sense spending last 20 years studying exact
thing primates seeing protective effects. explanation turned
one things like law unexpected consequences. Okay,
menopause women, lasts different lengths time, may factor going
come. know what, not start giving study subjects estrogen
totally past menopause. got lag time between, shift
sorts estrogen receptor patterns, bad effects come from.
- Wow! - monkey studies involved just maintaining ovulatory levels
post-menopausal period. get great effects. Estrogen one
greatest predictors protection Alzheimer's disease, that, needs
physiological. Just keep continuing body long time
versus let whole thing shutdown suddenly like try fire coal stoves
bottom basement kind thing, get going, get utterly different
outcomes. caused lot human health consequences people suddenly
decided estrogen fact neurologically endangering post-menopausally. - Wow,
fascinating. never thought steroid hormone receptors not
binding estrogen, devoid estrogen binding, say, set off
opposite biochemical cascades. Fascinating. guess raises question
testosterone replacement too, whether not people [laughs] talk doctor
long. Men women talk physicians long avoid these,
whatever happening periods isn't sufficient testosterone and/or
estrogen. sounds like cause longer-term problems even therapies
introduced. - Two additional misery slash complications. So, okay, trying
understand, look women history without post-menopausal estrogen
replacement done great. seeing 20 years later, estrogen
predictor decreased risk Alzheimer's. got start trying
unpacking prospective type studies. much estrogen? times? Estrogen


catchall term bunch hormones, estrone, estradiol, estriol. much one
them? Natural synthetic? Go try figure out. second
complication is, often hard say anything estrogen outside
context progesterone doing. often not absolute levels either,
ratio two. complicated endocrine system
testosterone. generate dramatic cyclicity like no male
hypothalamus ever dream off. much, much complicated system, thus,
lot complicated understand,

00:39:40 Testosterone & Sperm Counts Males Really Dropping?

let alone like figure ideal benefits it. - Yeah. don't know
make literature dropping rates testosterone endocrine disruptors.
Berkeley Tyrone Hayes published data frogs drinking
water various locations throughout United States, not just California,
seeing severe endocrine disruption blockade or, androgen receptors
sorts issues. hear time now sperm counts
dropping, endocrine disruptors birth control
water, drinking water. starts sound little crazy, yet also
fooled by, guess good example be, lot crazy stuff
world online terrible stuff highly processed foods. yet got
respectable people, endocrinologists UCSF like Robert Lustig saying, yeah, lot
hidden sugars emulsifiers, causing real problems.
become open-minded question. so, suffering drops
sperm counts testosterone estrogen fertility consequence endocrine
disruptors environments food, social reasons? anything
can hang hat like real data confident in? just mess? -
No, phenomenon appear quite real. Cross-sectional studies, human
populations, still don't understand one first things Hayes
spotted. Decreasing testicle size crocodiles. [Andrew laughs] Go figure
one first contributions this. think phenomenon absolutely real.
left two classic challenges, correlated
something broad environmental toxins. ones, much, when, etc.?
one always being, well, okay, dropping dropping enough make difference.


big effect this? juries still out. - Yeah,
area know lot interest in, got groups people won't
touch receipt store BPAs inks the...
[laughs] got people don't care things. fascinating area.

00:42:15 Stress Mitigation & Sense Control

hope biology will done soon. like briefly return stress.
described study two rats, one running wheel voluntarily, one
basically stuck running wheel, forced run anytime, rat number one runs.
one case rat voluntarily exercising. [laughs] case, rat
forced go PE class, speak, really, seeing divergent effects
biology. like just touch use kind case study stress
mitigation general. rather obsessed colleague, David Spiegel, Associate
Chair Psychiatry Stanford obsessed question of, humans can start
mitigate stress? think stress mitigation
individuals families culture try encourage people
mitigate stress, ways not going turn us rat number two,
forced mitigate stress therefore becomes stressful.
[laughs] - see is, rat number one gets benefits exercise. Rat
number two gets downsides severe stress exact muscle
expenditure movements going on. Perfectly yoked, great example
interpretation head. haven't kept literature, bet you, rat
number two whole lot activity amygdala rat number one.
Okay, stress mitigation. Anything say preface with,
reasonably good telling people going happen don't manage
stress, terrible actually like managing stress advising manage that.
much better bad news aspect it. see is, now just classic
literature, half century old, sort showing building blocks stress. Not,
ooh, step outside gored elephant, can grow
experience? doesn't kill makes stronger.
stress response, realm gray zone ambiguous social
interactions, sort thing. people massive stress responses, others not
all, between, enjoy it. Like building blocks of, makes


psychological stress stressful? first one exactly brought
running study. sense control? sense control makes stressors less
stressful. running wheel shows studies you, lab rat
college freshman volunteer trained pressing lever, less likely
get shock. today lever working away unbeknownst
lever turned off, no effect shock frequency,
think control, less stress response. rat
day-in day-out, less likely get ulcer. sense
control. related sense predictability. Rat get shocked, human gets
shocked, whatever, scenario either shocks come now then,
shocks come now then, 10 seconds little warning light comes on.
get warning light, shocks distressful. got predictability
not getting warning lights, second half second away
next shock. get warning light, know isn't one, got
least 10 seconds worth relaxation. know coming, can prepare
coping responses, best afterward know finally safe,
can recover it. enormously protective. Others outlet frustration,
take rat getting shocked, run running wheel,
protective thing, voluntarily. got rat can gnaw bar
wood, stressor less stressful. Unfortunately, rat primate human
stressed, ability aggressively dump somebody smaller weaker
also reduces stress response. fact displacement aggression reduces
stress accounts huge percent triggers like unhappiness.
variables, get social support well. good one. Interpreting circumstances
good news rather bad. Hurray, got simple sort like take
home recipe go get much control much predictability many
outlets much social support possible, going just fine.
go that, recipe total disaster much, much
subtle that. one great example, okay, getting shocks, want
warning beforehand, get little warning light 10 seconds shock,
wonderfully protective. Get warning light one second shock doesn't
anything. not enough time get psychological benefits
anticipation. Now instead, gets little warning coming two minutes
shock, going make things worse not going sitting


like reveling sort sense predictability, soon going be, oh.
going sitting two minutes saying, damn, comes. Predictive
information works narrow domain. Similarly, control. want
sense control face stress? answer is, mild moderate
stressor happening then, sense control completely
independent reality whether control not, face mild
moderate stressors, sense control gets interpreted as, wow, look much worse
things been. Thank God, control, top master fate.
contrast, major stressor, arbitrary sense control make
think, oh God, look much better been. prevented it.
know intuitively like face people's worst stressors.
Nobody stopped car way kids suddenly jumped out. wouldn't
mattered gotten doctor month ago, instead now,
wouldn't made any... didn't actually control. see is,
absolutely want huge sense control mild moderate stressors,
especially ones result good outcome. Hooray, me, face horrible
stressors, want like self-deception, like truth beauty don't
necessarily go hand-in-hand point. stress management techniques
impact control predictability wind far worse neutral preaching
somebody homeless somebody terminal cancer, somebody
refugee. Tell neurotic middle-class person psychological tools
turn hell heaven. truth that. thing somebody
going real hell, just privileged heartlessness
doesn't work. outlets, outlets damaging,
not good way mitigate stress. Social support, confusing mere
acquaintances real social support, going rug pulled
point. mistaking social support being, going bitching
moaning demanding supportiveness everyone around rather
reciprocally, not going work well either. not simple.
not nothing lots us really lousy. It, like good friends things
like that, takes lot work right? wrong may
temporarily seem like great thing, turns completely misplaced
faith, going feeling worse started.



00:51:35 Best Buffer Stress

- Interesting. days, lot interest using physical practices mitigate
stress, trying get ruminating, extent take control neural
circuits brain using exercise using breathing hypnosis. And, course,
hypnosis mental component well. thoughts stress mitigation
standpoint of, okay, don't want rat number two, want select
something ourselves, take initiative ourselves. forced
exercising not, actually negative health effect perhaps. need
pick something like, need take control it. terms supporting
people, touched bit. best way support people?
talk stressful thing? mean, not asking play psychologist here,
find divergent data this. can spin lather ruminating
something. language seems like wonderful tool, also fairly
deprived tool doesn't really get core physiology like something
like breathing would. thoughts more, lack better way put
it, head-centered, cognitive approaches stress mitigation versus kind going
core physiology. Cold showers now even thing extent just get
people stress acclimated, voluntarily taking cold showers. - makes sense
physiologically, preconditioning real stressors come. terms
bring up, oh, transcendental meditation, mindfulness, exercise, prayer, sort reflecting
gratitude, sort thing. Collectively work average, work
terms of, can lower heart rate cholesterol levels sorts good
outcomes, compromise us. One exactly caveat comes
running wheel study is, doesn't matter many friends swear stress
management technique. makes want scream head off 10
seconds, not one going work you. read fine print
testimonials, got something works you. Another one stress
management type techniques work, can't save weekend, can't
save stuck hold phone Muzak two minutes.
got something stop virtually, daily every
day, spend 20, 30 minutes it. see coming
like 80/20 rule economics. 80/20, 80% complaints store come
20% customers, things like that. see is, entire life consists


every single thing shoulders, can't say no 24/7. stopped
finally said, wellbeing important enough finally get say no
stuff can't say no to. going every day 20 minutes,
whatever stress management technique 20 minutes sort
knows what, already 80% way simply decided
wellbeing important enough going stop every single day
priority. exactly finding find people chronic
depression untreated merely calling getting appointment see mental
health professional, people start feeling better already evidence
activated, matter enough this, conceive
actually good outcome rather hopeless one. Just something
meditative reflective every day so, hardly even matters one
doing. comes thus another warning, not trust anybody
says, scientifically proven brand stress management works
better ones. Just watch wallet point. - Yeah, amen. think one
core goals lab David Spiegel's lab, know worked
David published papers David well really try find
various entry points thing call autonomic nervous system
stress system, systems gone unchecked really can take us
dark path. idea many entry points really one keeps,
data keep telling us again. no magic breathing tool
exercise, variety one those. And, again, come back idea
one select one make space for, one
hopefully enjoy going work best terms physiology. - [mumbles]
benign people stuck around you.

00:57:04 Power Perception, Choice & Individual Differences

- Right, right, absolutely. brings question of, find amazing
perceive event, whether not chose event not can
incredible different effects circuitry brain circuitry body
biology cells. ways boggles mind, like can decision made
presumably prefrontal cortex, although parts brain well, can
change essentially polarity response body. And, mean, talked


Type personalities there. don't go detail
sake time, interesting effects endothelial cells. mean, literally
size of, [laughs] portals blood opposite direction, depending
whether not somebody wants situation highly motivated person. Maybe
just give us top contour think really illustrates
principle beautifully. maybe would, just speculate
brain might switch turn one experience terrible beneficial
beneficial terrible, really fascinating. - Well, need like tonight
going sleep lying bed nice drowsy
heart's beating nice slow, start thinking fact heart isn't going
beat forever. [Andrew laughs] imagine toes getting cold afterward
imagine flow blood coming halt clotting. going
something physiology point 99% mammals
running frantically. going turning sympathetic
stress response thought, emotions, memory. measure
just much cortex limbic system sends projections
autonomic regulators brain. can think autonomic regulatory neurons
action ways animals can like extremes environmental
circumstances. given autonomic rule, mean, big challenge
understanding gigantic individual differences. that's, talk
optimal amount stress, counts stimulation, general stress not
severe doesn't go long overall benevolence setting.
conditions, love stressed something unexpected
control predictability like really interesting plot turn movie watching.
great, get individual differences somehow accommodate
fact people, perfect stimulatory amount stress like getting
early Audubon birdwatching walk next Sunday morning. somebody else,
signing like mercenary Yemen. [Andrew laughs]

01:00:32 Context-Setting, Prefrontal Cortex & Hierarchy

tremendous individual differences swamp simple prescriptions. - Yeah,
prefrontal cortex, thinking machinery harbor, double-edged
sword. remarkable is, areas brain like hypothalamus


amygdala, sort like switches. mean, context gain
control. talked gain control testosterone, etc., really like
switches. mean, stimulate ventromedial hypothalamus, get right neurons,
animal will try kill even object sitting next it. tickle
neurons, it'll try mate object. mean, really wild. think
probably rules prefrontal cortex also, sounds like context plural
prefrontal cortex can draw probably infinite, probably learn
perceive threat anything. Whether not another group whether not
science whether not somebody's version shape earth versus
another. mean, like, can plug anything system give enough data,
think sounds like drive fear response love response.
overstepping? - [laughs] mixed horribly ambivalent one changing
millisecond, like mutually contradictory. No, absolutely case
prefrontal cortex, regretted like wasted 30 years
life studying hippocampus shoot studied prefrontal cortex
much interesting does, contextual stuff.
ways not okay lie setting, great thing another.
not okay kill unless them, get medal. not,
social context moral relativity situational ethic stuff, prefrontal cortex
got master that. winds meaning place brain
anywhere say perception things can powerfully influence
reality coming you. - Yeah. - mean, great example, just harking back
testosterone. Okay, exercise boosts testosterone levels. exercise
success exercise failure? literature back 80s looking
outcomes marathons. testosterone rise people win
losers? Wrestling matches. Things sort simple prediction answer
wound being, didn't see simple answer. Okay, win marathon, not
necessarily predictor increased testosterone. about? find
like winner testosterone decreases, find guy came 73rd
massive testosterone increase. Whoa, about?
far human subtlety. guy won race decline testosterone
came three minutes later really, really expecting.
everybody now going writing hill. guy
came 73rd boost testosterone assuming dead


heart attack third mile, [Andrew laughs] instead managed finish.
interpretive stuff going there, prefrontal cortex about. -
Amazing, raises question cognitive flexibility, Can tell
something good us even not enjoying it? can wriggle around
corners choosing exercise the... Personally not big fan long bouts
meditation, benefited tremendously things like dedicated breathing
shorter rounds meditation. Can tell good wriggle around
corner get physiology working way want? cognitive
flexibility? Can third place runner tell myself, well, least came in,
wanted win badly. primary goal, another goal beat
previous time, that. so, [laughs] mean, it's... extent can
toggle relationship prefrontal cortex primitive
systems? - Well, enormous amount. example, low hierarchy
generally bad health like every mammal there, including us,
something special, can part multiple hierarchies time.
maybe low ranking one them, extremely high ranking
another, like crappiest job corporation, captain
softball team year company. better bet somebody
going find sorts ways decide nine five Monday Fridays, just stupid
paying bills. really matters prestige weekend. poorer,
deacon church here. can play sorts psychological
games that. One like consistent, reliable ones need
use frontal cortex like crazy is, somebody something rotten need
attribute it. answer is, something wrong, hmm, rotten.
Always always will constitutional explanation. something
rotten somebody, explain afterward? situational one. tired,
stressed sort setting, misunderstood this. best excusing
bad things access inner lives got
prefrontal cortexes great coming situational explanation rather than,
hey, maybe just like selfish rotten human, need change.
prefrontal cortex, every time, don't let somebody merge lane
front us, even though curse somebody thing and...
Endlessly. - love it. statement fact can select multiple
hierarchies participate in. seems like particularly important one nowadays


social media prevalent. know not particularly active social
media although might pleasantly, don't know unpleasantly surprised find
lot positive discussion work, don't even
need there. just continue discuss [laughs] work.
interesting social media found context very, broad. mean,
one argue one selects follow news articles reading,
etc. can create kind funneling information can dangerous.
verification crazy ideas even just less exposure new ideas. also
idea social media incredibly broad context. scroll feed,
no longer like eighth grade classroom office faculty
meeting. exposed thousands, not millions contexts, meal,
soccer game, person's body, person's intellect. YouTube another example.
vast, vast landscape. context completely mishmash whereas assuming
evolved. think evolve contexts much constrained.
interacted limited number individuals limited number different domains,
seasons tended constrain us all. course, got phones televisions,
started expand, now ever, brain, prefrontal cortex
sense exist multiple hierarchies essentially wicked
infinity. think might interacting primitive
systems aspects biology? - Well, think get is, ways
punchline of, human humans, use
exact blueprint, hormones, kinases, receptors,
same, everything built exact stuff species
there, go use completely novel way. usually terms
able abstract stuff space time dramatic ways. So, okay, low
ranking baboon can feel badly just like killed rabbit
eat higher ranking guy boots off takes away you,
feel crummy stressful unhappy. exact
things like brain bodies losing sense self-esteem,
can watching movie character screen feeling inadequate compared
like wonderful attractive are. can somebody driving past us
expensive car, don't even see face, can feel belittled
socioeconomic status. can watch like Lifestyles Rich Famous
read Bezos to. reason, decide life less fulfilling


didn't fly space 11 minutes. can feel miserable
ways no organism can, simply can
meaningful social networks include like party reading Facebook
weren't invited taking place Singapore, don't know
people, nonetheless, somehow means

01:11:20 Dr. Sapolsky Accomplishes Deep Thinking

feel less content turned be. take steps life
actively restrict contexts think live contemplate order
enhance creative life, intellectual life? steps actively take? -
Well, actively don't know make use anything [laughs] social media.
guess counts thus actively chosen not learn how.
case certainly last year half, like lots people, gone stretches
managed sort enforce moratorium looking news,
wonderfully freeing. think larger sense though, addition
neurobiologist, sort spent decades spending part year studying wild
baboons national park East Africa. spend three months year without
electricity, without phone calls, going 12 hours day without saying word
somebody. finally would, somebody nomadic pastoralist guy
different language. Yeah, 90% like insightful thinking anything
laboratory three months year, not one lab, not
inundated stuff. - Well, think shifting trend towards trying create
narrowing context that... like see, niece, 14-years-old
friends good putting phones away. say, not
going phones interaction, especially after... realized still
somewhat this. unclear headed,

01:13:17 Free Will?

2020 restrictive separated friends. Now it's,
really focus together not bring elements phones.
brings great hope generation, [laughs] maybe will...
knows, maybe run off study baboons, need field researchers.


along lines choice, like shift gears slightly talk freewill,
ability make choices all. - Well, personal way left field inflammatory
stance is, don't think shred freewill despite 95% philosophers.
think probably majority neuroscientists saying freewill least
circumstances. don't think all. reason is,
something, behave, make choice, whatever. understand
that, intention come from? Part due like sensory
environment previous minute. hormone levels
bloodstream morning. whether wonderful
stressful last three months sort neuroplasticity happened. Part
hormone levels exposed fetus. Part culture ancestors
came with, thus parented kid.
there, can understand behavior coming without incorporating
those. point, not relevant factors,
ultimately one factor. talking evolution
behavior, definition also talking genetics. talking
genes behavior, definition talking brain
constructed proteins coded for. talking like mood
disorder now, talking sense efficacy getting five-year-
old. intertwined. look influences, basically like
challenge is, show neuron just caused behavior, show network
neurons just caused behavior. show nothing just
influenced anything sensory environment one second ago
evolution species. no space fit freewill concept
winds brain, not brain. simply no wiggle room
there. - can appreciate behaviors choices consequences
long line dominoes fell prior behavior. possible can
intervene domino effect, speak. words, can recognition
fact genes heritability, epigenome that, hormonal context,
historical context. Can knowledge give small shard
freewill? Meaning, allow say, ah, okay, accept choices
somewhat predetermined, yet knowing gives additional layer
control? philosophical biological universe works? - Nah.
can produce wonderfully positive belief change can happen. Even


traumatic change, even worst circumstances, unlikely people, change
can happen, things can change. Don't fatalistic, don't decide
mechanistic, biological machines nothing can ever... Change can happen,
people go off rails translating into, can change ourselves. don't,
can't no freewill. However, can changed circumstance.
point is, like look Aplysia, sea slug learned retract gill
response shock tail, can like conditioning, Pavlovian conditioning
it, learned, behavior changed environment. hear
news something like horrifically depressing going on, refugees wherever.
result, feel little bit helpless less sense efficacy
world, behaviors changed. Okay, okay, yeah, guess that,
remarkable thing is, exact neurobiology. signal transduction
pathways happening sea snail incorporate exact kinases
proteases phosphatases mammalian fear
conditioning, alert, conserved. exact thing, simply
playing obviously much, much fancier domain. learned
change possible despite understanding mechanistically can't change
volitionally, understand change possible, just
changed ability brain respond optimistic stimuli. changed
ability brain now send direction exposed
information will seem cheerful rather depressing. Oh God, amazing,
Nelson Mandela Martin Luther king folks did. Wow,
adverse circumstances, able do. Maybe can also, maybe can go
read people like get even data points change
neurochemistry, responses different now. tilted little bit
direction feeling like can make difference instead damn
hopeless. enormous change can happen, last thing come
view of, nothing less sum biology interactions
environment,

01:20:50 Apply Knowledge & Learning

throw hands say, thus no use trying change anything. -
can acknowledge change extremely hard impossible, circumstances


can change, yet striving better human beings still worthwhile
endeavor. correct? - Absolutely. simply knowledge, either
experience making end right neurobiology class taught
change can happen within framework mechanistic neurobiology.
now open made optimistic good news world around you.
likely inspired that, resistant getting
discouraged bad news, simply now understand possible. - Mm-hmm,
yeah, somebody spent much career working hippocampus,
assume believer neuroplasticity, neural circuits can change
response experience, so-called top-down mechanisms
prefrontal cortex talking can play role there,
decision try change pursuit knowledge pursuit experience
can shape circuitry, therefore make us different machines, speak. - Yeah.
not can say prenatal hormone exposure changed way brain
constructed, learning prenatal hormone exposure can change construction
brain will change brain right now, think
intentions came from. Wow, maybe something it. knowledge
knowledge effector itself. - important powerful
statement hear. think many people think tool, doesn't involve pill
protocol, useless. certainly pills protocols
useful variety context variety things, idea knowledge itself,
whereas put it, knowledge knowledge tool, think important
concept people embed minds. And, listen, grateful discussion
raising topics. think people, many people know work
testosterone, stress, covered today, work freewill
idea hopeless total control. think realizing
listening neither true, solution resides

01:23:44 Robert’s New Book: “Determined: Science Life Without Free Will”

understanding freewill lack it, [laughs] also neuroplasticity.
working book freewill, willing tell us little bit
book process can look forward to? - Yeah,
going really slow. Title is, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill."


essentially first half book trying convince reader, okay, not
no freewill whatsoever, least lot less normally assumed.
going standard arguments freewill, doesn't make sense
21st century science? led reading lot frustrating
philosophers basically willing admit stuff made like atoms
molecules. like physical reality sort world, not just relying
magic, believe freewill magical reasons, doesn't make
sense. Okay, first half book hopefully convince people
much less freewill used think. second half gigantic
juncture built around fact haven't thought freewill since like
adolescent. despite thinking way, still absolutely no idea
supposed function belief. supposed go everyday life
anything feel entitled isn't true? angers hatreds feel aren't justified,
no thing appropriate, blame punishment praise reward,
none makes sense, somebody like even compliments haircut,
conditioned say, oh, thanks, something do.
supposed function that? second half wrestling that,
punchline is, going incredibly hard. think going
hard subtract notion freewill making sense like serial murderers,
going thousand times harder making sense somebody says "good job"
you. [Andrew laughs] exact reality sort
interpretations. going incredibly hard, nonetheless look
history subtracted notion agency sorts realms
blame, starting thinking witches caused hailstorms 500 years ago notion
psychodynamically screwed mothers cause schizophrenia, done it.
done endless number times, able subtract sense volition
understanding world works around us. don't murderers running
amuck street, society hasn't collapsed puddle, fact,
humane society. good news possible done repeatedly
past, going hard hell. hard hell try write
coherently, [laughs] discovering, going slowly. - Well, speak many, many
people say really excited book done will
patiently wait, great excitement book, "Determined". said title,
correct? - Yeah, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill". seems like


can't publish book days without sub-title, it? - Fantastic. Well,
excited read book. grateful conversation today, learned
ton. Every time speak learn, really pleasure delight
interact today previous years, say, colleagues.
thank again, Robert, everything hard, hard work
thinking put work clear put lot hard work

Drops castration, doesn't go zero, prior history it, just
keeps coasting along even without testosterone. - interesting. Can
say exception terms early organizing effects hormones? Like,
instance, developing animal deprived testosterone estrogen
aromatized testosterone estrogen, whole story is, know.
imagine circuits brain responsible initiating sexual
behavior first place might not emerge, therefore not sensitive
testosterone later life. right?

00:20:28 Finger Length Ratios Reflect Prenatal Hormone Levels

Okay. - Yeah, exactly. great way seeing totally nutty biological
factoid, second fourth digit ratio enhanced. - Oh yeah. - Totally obscure
thing, ratio one way reflects levels testosterone, androgen
exposure fetal life. can't remember way goes minuscule
need thousand people sample size able see anything, see
primates, already fetal sonograms, that. readout
subtle differences prenatal exposure, winds predictor whole
range sort stuff adult behavior. So, yeah, fetal end, still
building everything, testosterone amount making huge difference.
time adult, just somewhat old non-signal. - Yeah,
confession, master's student Berkeley Marc Breedlove's
arena, author paper, although deep within author line,
got description exactly right D2, index finger ring finger
ratio similar females males. males, index finger tends
shorter. people listening now freaking
measuring, proper way measure this, is, eyeballing doesn't
work time unless extremes. interesting stories there.
actually replicated no fewer five times, Marc Breedlove tells me.
yes, terms early organizing effects, seem robust studies.
later effects sort activation neural circuits hormones.

00:22:30 Aggression: Male-Female, Female-Male, & Female-Female



absolutely fascinated this. couple questions, is,
normally associate testosterone males, course, females make testosterone
well adrenals presumably elsewhere too. guessing looked hard
enough, probably find sources androgens females. Can
say general contours effects aggression also pertain females?
suppose ask particular female-female aggression,
exist many species, female-male agregression well maternal aggression,
robust aspect evolution, course, mother will, angry mother
animal kind protecting young truly dangerous, best sense word.
- type post-parturition, period birth aggression estrogen,
progesterone, sorts things. Female aggression, rest time
testosterone major player much lower level average. average,
one always say, basically punchlines. females, lower
levels testosterone essential typical levels aggression sexual behavior.
Nonetheless, not causing it, not sensitive small individual differences.
exact thing. can get way over-impressed

00:24:05 Testosterone: Challenge Hypothesis

importance androgens females just readily males. - line
that, conceptualize testosterone? realize isn't single sentence
can capture hormone effects hormones many different
slow fast effects brain, glands own, glands
produce them. heard talk testosterone today years,
start get impression misunderstood molecule [laughs] human
health universe, clearly something powerful. shifting way
certain neural circuits work, adjusting gain amygdala, described,
certainly things well. truism testosterone like,
relationship effort relationship resilience, way maybe will help
people sort think think testosterone? - Yeah. Maybe
three separate answers that. first one is, think fair summary think
comes motivated strong behaviors, testosterone make
whatever already are. me, sexual arousal, libido, aggressiveness,
spontaneous aggression, reactive aggression, things sort. upping volume


things already strongly there. Second way think is, well, like
favorite finding testosterone. wonderful work guy,
John Wingfield, one best behavioral endocrinologists there.
20 years ago formulated called Challenge Hypothesis Testosterone
Action. testosterone do? Testosterone secrete
status challenged, makes likely behaviors
needed hold onto status. Okay, totally boringly straightforward
baboon. somebody challenging high rank, appropriate response
part going aggression. right, just got back door,
testosterone aggression, again. get humans, humans lots
different ways achieving maintaining status. need go like
fancy private school's annual auction, will see half-drunk alpha
males competing see can give money away show conspicuous
like property have. setting like that, mean, haven't able take
urine samples, times, unfortunately, shows flip side it.
species hands status different sort way, testosterone going
boost also. Okay, generates totally nutty prediction. Wow, take people
circumstance, say playing economic game get status trustworthy
generous interactions game. give people testosterone,
make generous? absolutely case. Totally cool
finding. showing you, don't know, basically took whole bunch Buddhist
monks shot testosterone, get competitive
random acts kindness. societal problem
much aggression, first culprit look not testosterone, first look
hand much damn elevated status aggression many
circumstances. find finding fantastic. Third thing subtlety
testosterone. Okay, like subtler behavioral effects, give testosterone
people become confident, become self-confident. Well,
good, people pay take sorts nonsensical self-help courses will boost
self-esteem. good thing unless testosterone makes confident,
inaccurate, likely barrel wrong decisions. shown
economic game play testosterone making confident makes less
cooperative needs cooperate top own.
Testosterone makes people cocky impulsive. might great one setting,


is, absolutely sure army get
country three days. hell, start World War I, get big surprise it.
Testosterone altering risk assessment beforehand probably played big role kind
miscalculation.

00:29:20 Dopamine Impacts Testosterone & Motivation

- Super-interesting. always think testosterone dopamine close cousins
brain, not just relationship pituitary
hypothalamus. That, course, also dopamine's salient role creating
bias towards exteroception. somebody takes drug, increases
dopamine, chockablock full dopamine. tend, want highlight 'tend'
is, really generalizing here, tend focus outward goals,
things beyond boundaries skin. testosterone seems bit
same, tends put us similar mode perceiving outside world ways
asking questions like, relate species? relate
goals? anything can better conceptualize relationship
testosterone dopamine motivation? just take us
alleyways of, neural pathways hypothalamus? fine too. - Well,
think got lots sort massive revisionism dopamine. Everyone,
since pharaohs got brought taught dopamine pleasure
reward. turns isn't, anticipation reward, generating
motivation, goal-directed behavior needed go get reward.
know it, using like elevated dopamine, entire life motivate
whatever going get like entry heaven after-life kind of, sort
thing. really motivation. testosterone even individuals
not aggressive testosterone replacement often helpful thing
aging males increases energy, increases sense thereness, presence
alertness increases motivation. whole aspect, takes us
motivation get like go, hand lots soup soup kitchen
homeless people, get go ethnically cleanse village. got much
makeup testosterone got onboard. activating
energetic sense, testosterone within minutes increases glucose uptake skeletal
muscle. just awake alert that, lot


dopamine does. one might predict then, getting just right levels
testosterone infused bloodstream feels great lab rats. will lever press
get infused range optimizes dopamine release. is,
absolutely right, deeply intertwined. - Yeah, beautiful biology there.

00:32:32 Estrogen: Improves Brain & Longevity TIMING KEY

love way encapsulate relationship. want ask estrogen,
don't hear estrogen often, always interesting now
public facing education, testosterone controversial molecule, just say
almost controversial. [laughs] [Robert laughs] estrogen doesn't seem hold
controversial weight, yet estrogen powerful effects
animal brain human brain males females. Men not want
estrogen go low. Terrible things happen, will lose cognitive function, libido
can drop. men need estrogen well, perhaps maybe can put filter
estrogen testosterone. general themes estrogen
people aware think generally misunderstood? really
feelings empathy making us sensitive? sense not. - No,
context dependent. estrogen giving birth playing central
role wanting shred face somebody getting close kittens kind
thing, know not just warm, fuzzy, empathic kind stuff. Estrogen lots
ways summarized by, got choice matter lot
estrogen bloodstream not, go lot estrogen. enhances
cognition, exactly said, stimulates neurogenesis hippocampus,
increases glucose oxygen delivery, protects dementia, decreases
inflammatory oxidative damage blood vessels, good protecting
cardiovascular disease contrast testosterone, making everyone
things worse. springs minefield question, is,
post-menopausal estrogen? sorts lab studies non-human primates
suggested keep estrogen levels high monkey's equivalent
menopause. going keep brain health lot better decreasing risk
dementia, stroke, every thing. Estrogen great antioxidant, that.
90s think Healy, forgetting name, first female
head NIH, Bernadine Healy set massive prospective human study,


going biggest one times, looking pluses minuses post-
menopausal estrogen. tens thousands women, was...
cut study short seeing was, estrogen not
normal bad stuff expect terms decalcification stuff,
increasing risk cardiovascular disease, increasing risk stroke,
increasing risk dementia. ground halt everybody,
stopped study front page news everybody panned point. nobody
make sense spending last 20 years studying exact
thing primates seeing protective effects. explanation turned
one things like law unexpected consequences. Okay,
menopause women, lasts different lengths time, may factor going
come. know what, not start giving study subjects estrogen
totally past menopause. got lag time between, shift
sorts estrogen receptor patterns, bad effects come from.
- Wow! - monkey studies involved just maintaining ovulatory levels
post-menopausal period. get great effects. Estrogen one
greatest predictors protection Alzheimer's disease, that, needs
physiological. Just keep continuing body long time
versus let whole thing shutdown suddenly like try fire coal stoves
bottom basement kind thing, get going, get utterly different
outcomes. caused lot human health consequences people suddenly
decided estrogen fact neurologically endangering post-menopausally. - Wow,
fascinating. never thought steroid hormone receptors not
binding estrogen, devoid estrogen binding, say, set off
opposite biochemical cascades. Fascinating. guess raises question
testosterone replacement too, whether not people [laughs] talk doctor
long. Men women talk physicians long avoid these,
whatever happening periods isn't sufficient testosterone and/or
estrogen. sounds like cause longer-term problems even therapies
introduced. - Two additional misery slash complications. So, okay, trying
understand, look women history without post-menopausal estrogen
replacement done great. seeing 20 years later, estrogen
predictor decreased risk Alzheimer's. got start trying
unpacking prospective type studies. much estrogen? times? Estrogen


catchall term bunch hormones, estrone, estradiol, estriol. much one
them? Natural synthetic? Go try figure out. second
complication is, often hard say anything estrogen outside
context progesterone doing. often not absolute levels either,
ratio two. complicated endocrine system
testosterone. generate dramatic cyclicity like no male
hypothalamus ever dream off. much, much complicated system, thus,
lot complicated understand,

00:39:40 Testosterone & Sperm Counts Males Really Dropping?

let alone like figure ideal benefits it. - Yeah. don't know
make literature dropping rates testosterone endocrine disruptors.
Berkeley Tyrone Hayes published data frogs drinking
water various locations throughout United States, not just California,
seeing severe endocrine disruption blockade or, androgen receptors
sorts issues. hear time now sperm counts
dropping, endocrine disruptors birth control
water, drinking water. starts sound little crazy, yet also
fooled by, guess good example be, lot crazy stuff
world online terrible stuff highly processed foods. yet got
respectable people, endocrinologists UCSF like Robert Lustig saying, yeah, lot
hidden sugars emulsifiers, causing real problems.
become open-minded question. so, suffering drops
sperm counts testosterone estrogen fertility consequence endocrine
disruptors environments food, social reasons? anything
can hang hat like real data confident in? just mess? -
No, phenomenon appear quite real. Cross-sectional studies, human
populations, still don't understand one first things Hayes
spotted. Decreasing testicle size crocodiles. [Andrew laughs] Go figure
one first contributions this. think phenomenon absolutely real.
left two classic challenges, correlated
something broad environmental toxins. ones, much, when, etc.?
one always being, well, okay, dropping dropping enough make difference.


big effect this? juries still out. - Yeah,
area know lot interest in, got groups people won't
touch receipt store BPAs inks the...
[laughs] got people don't care things. fascinating area.

00:42:15 Stress Mitigation & Sense Control

hope biology will done soon. like briefly return stress.
described study two rats, one running wheel voluntarily, one
basically stuck running wheel, forced run anytime, rat number one runs.
one case rat voluntarily exercising. [laughs] case, rat
forced go PE class, speak, really, seeing divergent effects
biology. like just touch use kind case study stress
mitigation general. rather obsessed colleague, David Spiegel, Associate
Chair Psychiatry Stanford obsessed question of, humans can start
mitigate stress? think stress mitigation
individuals families culture try encourage people
mitigate stress, ways not going turn us rat number two,
forced mitigate stress therefore becomes stressful.
[laughs] - see is, rat number one gets benefits exercise. Rat
number two gets downsides severe stress exact muscle
expenditure movements going on. Perfectly yoked, great example
interpretation head. haven't kept literature, bet you, rat
number two whole lot activity amygdala rat number one.
Okay, stress mitigation. Anything say preface with,
reasonably good telling people going happen don't manage
stress, terrible actually like managing stress advising manage that.
much better bad news aspect it. see is, now just classic
literature, half century old, sort showing building blocks stress. Not,
ooh, step outside gored elephant, can grow
experience? doesn't kill makes stronger.
stress response, realm gray zone ambiguous social
interactions, sort thing. people massive stress responses, others not
all, between, enjoy it. Like building blocks of, makes


psychological stress stressful? first one exactly brought
running study. sense control? sense control makes stressors less
stressful. running wheel shows studies you, lab rat
college freshman volunteer trained pressing lever, less likely
get shock. today lever working away unbeknownst
lever turned off, no effect shock frequency,
think control, less stress response. rat
day-in day-out, less likely get ulcer. sense
control. related sense predictability. Rat get shocked, human gets
shocked, whatever, scenario either shocks come now then,
shocks come now then, 10 seconds little warning light comes on.
get warning light, shocks distressful. got predictability
not getting warning lights, second half second away
next shock. get warning light, know isn't one, got
least 10 seconds worth relaxation. know coming, can prepare
coping responses, best afterward know finally safe,
can recover it. enormously protective. Others outlet frustration,
take rat getting shocked, run running wheel,
protective thing, voluntarily. got rat can gnaw bar
wood, stressor less stressful. Unfortunately, rat primate human
stressed, ability aggressively dump somebody smaller weaker
also reduces stress response. fact displacement aggression reduces
stress accounts huge percent triggers like unhappiness.
variables, get social support well. good one. Interpreting circumstances
good news rather bad. Hurray, got simple sort like take
home recipe go get much control much predictability many
outlets much social support possible, going just fine.
go that, recipe total disaster much, much
subtle that. one great example, okay, getting shocks, want
warning beforehand, get little warning light 10 seconds shock,
wonderfully protective. Get warning light one second shock doesn't
anything. not enough time get psychological benefits
anticipation. Now instead, gets little warning coming two minutes
shock, going make things worse not going sitting


like reveling sort sense predictability, soon going be, oh.
going sitting two minutes saying, damn, comes. Predictive
information works narrow domain. Similarly, control. want
sense control face stress? answer is, mild moderate
stressor happening then, sense control completely
independent reality whether control not, face mild
moderate stressors, sense control gets interpreted as, wow, look much worse
things been. Thank God, control, top master fate.
contrast, major stressor, arbitrary sense control make
think, oh God, look much better been. prevented it.
know intuitively like face people's worst stressors.
Nobody stopped car way kids suddenly jumped out. wouldn't
mattered gotten doctor month ago, instead now,
wouldn't made any... didn't actually control. see is,
absolutely want huge sense control mild moderate stressors,
especially ones result good outcome. Hooray, me, face horrible
stressors, want like self-deception, like truth beauty don't
necessarily go hand-in-hand point. stress management techniques
impact control predictability wind far worse neutral preaching
somebody homeless somebody terminal cancer, somebody
refugee. Tell neurotic middle-class person psychological tools
turn hell heaven. truth that. thing somebody
going real hell, just privileged heartlessness
doesn't work. outlets, outlets damaging,
not good way mitigate stress. Social support, confusing mere
acquaintances real social support, going rug pulled
point. mistaking social support being, going bitching
moaning demanding supportiveness everyone around rather
reciprocally, not going work well either. not simple.
not nothing lots us really lousy. It, like good friends things
like that, takes lot work right? wrong may
temporarily seem like great thing, turns completely misplaced
faith, going feeling worse started.



00:51:35 Best Buffer Stress

- Interesting. days, lot interest using physical practices mitigate
stress, trying get ruminating, extent take control neural
circuits brain using exercise using breathing hypnosis. And, course,
hypnosis mental component well. thoughts stress mitigation
standpoint of, okay, don't want rat number two, want select
something ourselves, take initiative ourselves. forced
exercising not, actually negative health effect perhaps. need
pick something like, need take control it. terms supporting
people, touched bit. best way support people?
talk stressful thing? mean, not asking play psychologist here,
find divergent data this. can spin lather ruminating
something. language seems like wonderful tool, also fairly
deprived tool doesn't really get core physiology like something
like breathing would. thoughts more, lack better way put
it, head-centered, cognitive approaches stress mitigation versus kind going
core physiology. Cold showers now even thing extent just get
people stress acclimated, voluntarily taking cold showers. - makes sense
physiologically, preconditioning real stressors come. terms
bring up, oh, transcendental meditation, mindfulness, exercise, prayer, sort reflecting
gratitude, sort thing. Collectively work average, work
terms of, can lower heart rate cholesterol levels sorts good
outcomes, compromise us. One exactly caveat comes
running wheel study is, doesn't matter many friends swear stress
management technique. makes want scream head off 10
seconds, not one going work you. read fine print
testimonials, got something works you. Another one stress
management type techniques work, can't save weekend, can't
save stuck hold phone Muzak two minutes.
got something stop virtually, daily every
day, spend 20, 30 minutes it. see coming
like 80/20 rule economics. 80/20, 80% complaints store come
20% customers, things like that. see is, entire life consists


every single thing shoulders, can't say no 24/7. stopped
finally said, wellbeing important enough finally get say no
stuff can't say no to. going every day 20 minutes,
whatever stress management technique 20 minutes sort
knows what, already 80% way simply decided
wellbeing important enough going stop every single day
priority. exactly finding find people chronic
depression untreated merely calling getting appointment see mental
health professional, people start feeling better already evidence
activated, matter enough this, conceive
actually good outcome rather hopeless one. Just something
meditative reflective every day so, hardly even matters one
doing. comes thus another warning, not trust anybody
says, scientifically proven brand stress management works
better ones. Just watch wallet point. - Yeah, amen. think one
core goals lab David Spiegel's lab, know worked
David published papers David well really try find
various entry points thing call autonomic nervous system
stress system, systems gone unchecked really can take us
dark path. idea many entry points really one keeps,
data keep telling us again. no magic breathing tool
exercise, variety one those. And, again, come back idea
one select one make space for, one
hopefully enjoy going work best terms physiology. - [mumbles]
benign people stuck around you.

00:57:04 Power Perception, Choice & Individual Differences

- Right, right, absolutely. brings question of, find amazing
perceive event, whether not chose event not can
incredible different effects circuitry brain circuitry body
biology cells. ways boggles mind, like can decision made
presumably prefrontal cortex, although parts brain well, can
change essentially polarity response body. And, mean, talked


Type personalities there. don't go detail
sake time, interesting effects endothelial cells. mean, literally
size of, [laughs] portals blood opposite direction, depending
whether not somebody wants situation highly motivated person. Maybe
just give us top contour think really illustrates
principle beautifully. maybe would, just speculate
brain might switch turn one experience terrible beneficial
beneficial terrible, really fascinating. - Well, need like tonight
going sleep lying bed nice drowsy
heart's beating nice slow, start thinking fact heart isn't going
beat forever. [Andrew laughs] imagine toes getting cold afterward
imagine flow blood coming halt clotting. going
something physiology point 99% mammals
running frantically. going turning sympathetic
stress response thought, emotions, memory. measure
just much cortex limbic system sends projections
autonomic regulators brain. can think autonomic regulatory neurons
action ways animals can like extremes environmental
circumstances. given autonomic rule, mean, big challenge
understanding gigantic individual differences. that's, talk
optimal amount stress, counts stimulation, general stress not
severe doesn't go long overall benevolence setting.
conditions, love stressed something unexpected
control predictability like really interesting plot turn movie watching.
great, get individual differences somehow accommodate
fact people, perfect stimulatory amount stress like getting
early Audubon birdwatching walk next Sunday morning. somebody else,
signing like mercenary Yemen. [Andrew laughs]

01:00:32 Context-Setting, Prefrontal Cortex & Hierarchy

tremendous individual differences swamp simple prescriptions. - Yeah,
prefrontal cortex, thinking machinery harbor, double-edged
sword. remarkable is, areas brain like hypothalamus


amygdala, sort like switches. mean, context gain
control. talked gain control testosterone, etc., really like
switches. mean, stimulate ventromedial hypothalamus, get right neurons,
animal will try kill even object sitting next it. tickle
neurons, it'll try mate object. mean, really wild. think
probably rules prefrontal cortex also, sounds like context plural
prefrontal cortex can draw probably infinite, probably learn
perceive threat anything. Whether not another group whether not
science whether not somebody's version shape earth versus
another. mean, like, can plug anything system give enough data,
think sounds like drive fear response love response.
overstepping? - [laughs] mixed horribly ambivalent one changing
millisecond, like mutually contradictory. No, absolutely case
prefrontal cortex, regretted like wasted 30 years
life studying hippocampus shoot studied prefrontal cortex
much interesting does, contextual stuff.
ways not okay lie setting, great thing another.
not okay kill unless them, get medal. not,
social context moral relativity situational ethic stuff, prefrontal cortex
got master that. winds meaning place brain
anywhere say perception things can powerfully influence
reality coming you. - Yeah. - mean, great example, just harking back
testosterone. Okay, exercise boosts testosterone levels. exercise
success exercise failure? literature back 80s looking
outcomes marathons. testosterone rise people win
losers? Wrestling matches. Things sort simple prediction answer
wound being, didn't see simple answer. Okay, win marathon, not
necessarily predictor increased testosterone. about? find
like winner testosterone decreases, find guy came 73rd
massive testosterone increase. Whoa, about?
far human subtlety. guy won race decline testosterone
came three minutes later really, really expecting.
everybody now going writing hill. guy
came 73rd boost testosterone assuming dead


heart attack third mile, [Andrew laughs] instead managed finish.
interpretive stuff going there, prefrontal cortex about. -
Amazing, raises question cognitive flexibility, Can tell
something good us even not enjoying it? can wriggle around
corners choosing exercise the... Personally not big fan long bouts
meditation, benefited tremendously things like dedicated breathing
shorter rounds meditation. Can tell good wriggle around
corner get physiology working way want? cognitive
flexibility? Can third place runner tell myself, well, least came in,
wanted win badly. primary goal, another goal beat
previous time, that. so, [laughs] mean, it's... extent can
toggle relationship prefrontal cortex primitive
systems? - Well, enormous amount. example, low hierarchy
generally bad health like every mammal there, including us,
something special, can part multiple hierarchies time.
maybe low ranking one them, extremely high ranking
another, like crappiest job corporation, captain
softball team year company. better bet somebody
going find sorts ways decide nine five Monday Fridays, just stupid
paying bills. really matters prestige weekend. poorer,
deacon church here. can play sorts psychological
games that. One like consistent, reliable ones need
use frontal cortex like crazy is, somebody something rotten need
attribute it. answer is, something wrong, hmm, rotten.
Always always will constitutional explanation. something
rotten somebody, explain afterward? situational one. tired,
stressed sort setting, misunderstood this. best excusing
bad things access inner lives got
prefrontal cortexes great coming situational explanation rather than,
hey, maybe just like selfish rotten human, need change.
prefrontal cortex, every time, don't let somebody merge lane
front us, even though curse somebody thing and...
Endlessly. - love it. statement fact can select multiple
hierarchies participate in. seems like particularly important one nowadays


social media prevalent. know not particularly active social
media although might pleasantly, don't know unpleasantly surprised find
lot positive discussion work, don't even
need there. just continue discuss [laughs] work.
interesting social media found context very, broad. mean,
one argue one selects follow news articles reading,
etc. can create kind funneling information can dangerous.
verification crazy ideas even just less exposure new ideas. also
idea social media incredibly broad context. scroll feed,
no longer like eighth grade classroom office faculty
meeting. exposed thousands, not millions contexts, meal,
soccer game, person's body, person's intellect. YouTube another example.
vast, vast landscape. context completely mishmash whereas assuming
evolved. think evolve contexts much constrained.
interacted limited number individuals limited number different domains,
seasons tended constrain us all. course, got phones televisions,
started expand, now ever, brain, prefrontal cortex
sense exist multiple hierarchies essentially wicked
infinity. think might interacting primitive
systems aspects biology? - Well, think get is, ways
punchline of, human humans, use
exact blueprint, hormones, kinases, receptors,
same, everything built exact stuff species
there, go use completely novel way. usually terms
able abstract stuff space time dramatic ways. So, okay, low
ranking baboon can feel badly just like killed rabbit
eat higher ranking guy boots off takes away you,
feel crummy stressful unhappy. exact
things like brain bodies losing sense self-esteem,
can watching movie character screen feeling inadequate compared
like wonderful attractive are. can somebody driving past us
expensive car, don't even see face, can feel belittled
socioeconomic status. can watch like Lifestyles Rich Famous
read Bezos to. reason, decide life less fulfilling


didn't fly space 11 minutes. can feel miserable
ways no organism can, simply can
meaningful social networks include like party reading Facebook
weren't invited taking place Singapore, don't know
people, nonetheless, somehow means

01:11:20 Dr. Sapolsky Accomplishes Deep Thinking

feel less content turned be. take steps life
actively restrict contexts think live contemplate order
enhance creative life, intellectual life? steps actively take? -
Well, actively don't know make use anything [laughs] social media.
guess counts thus actively chosen not learn how.
case certainly last year half, like lots people, gone stretches
managed sort enforce moratorium looking news,
wonderfully freeing. think larger sense though, addition
neurobiologist, sort spent decades spending part year studying wild
baboons national park East Africa. spend three months year without
electricity, without phone calls, going 12 hours day without saying word
somebody. finally would, somebody nomadic pastoralist guy
different language. Yeah, 90% like insightful thinking anything
laboratory three months year, not one lab, not
inundated stuff. - Well, think shifting trend towards trying create
narrowing context that... like see, niece, 14-years-old
friends good putting phones away. say, not
going phones interaction, especially after... realized still
somewhat this. unclear headed,

01:13:17 Free Will?

2020 restrictive separated friends. Now it's,
really focus together not bring elements phones.
brings great hope generation, [laughs] maybe will...
knows, maybe run off study baboons, need field researchers.


along lines choice, like shift gears slightly talk freewill,
ability make choices all. - Well, personal way left field inflammatory
stance is, don't think shred freewill despite 95% philosophers.
think probably majority neuroscientists saying freewill least
circumstances. don't think all. reason is,
something, behave, make choice, whatever. understand
that, intention come from? Part due like sensory
environment previous minute. hormone levels
bloodstream morning. whether wonderful
stressful last three months sort neuroplasticity happened. Part
hormone levels exposed fetus. Part culture ancestors
came with, thus parented kid.
there, can understand behavior coming without incorporating
those. point, not relevant factors,
ultimately one factor. talking evolution
behavior, definition also talking genetics. talking
genes behavior, definition talking brain
constructed proteins coded for. talking like mood
disorder now, talking sense efficacy getting five-year-
old. intertwined. look influences, basically like
challenge is, show neuron just caused behavior, show network
neurons just caused behavior. show nothing just
influenced anything sensory environment one second ago
evolution species. no space fit freewill concept
winds brain, not brain. simply no wiggle room
there. - can appreciate behaviors choices consequences
long line dominoes fell prior behavior. possible can
intervene domino effect, speak. words, can recognition
fact genes heritability, epigenome that, hormonal context,
historical context. Can knowledge give small shard
freewill? Meaning, allow say, ah, okay, accept choices
somewhat predetermined, yet knowing gives additional layer
control? philosophical biological universe works? - Nah.
can produce wonderfully positive belief change can happen. Even


traumatic change, even worst circumstances, unlikely people, change
can happen, things can change. Don't fatalistic, don't decide
mechanistic, biological machines nothing can ever... Change can happen,
people go off rails translating into, can change ourselves. don't,
can't no freewill. However, can changed circumstance.
point is, like look Aplysia, sea slug learned retract gill
response shock tail, can like conditioning, Pavlovian conditioning
it, learned, behavior changed environment. hear
news something like horrifically depressing going on, refugees wherever.
result, feel little bit helpless less sense efficacy
world, behaviors changed. Okay, okay, yeah, guess that,
remarkable thing is, exact neurobiology. signal transduction
pathways happening sea snail incorporate exact kinases
proteases phosphatases mammalian fear
conditioning, alert, conserved. exact thing, simply
playing obviously much, much fancier domain. learned
change possible despite understanding mechanistically can't change
volitionally, understand change possible, just
changed ability brain respond optimistic stimuli. changed
ability brain now send direction exposed
information will seem cheerful rather depressing. Oh God, amazing,
Nelson Mandela Martin Luther king folks did. Wow,
adverse circumstances, able do. Maybe can also, maybe can go
read people like get even data points change
neurochemistry, responses different now. tilted little bit
direction feeling like can make difference instead damn
hopeless. enormous change can happen, last thing come
view of, nothing less sum biology interactions
environment,

01:20:50 Apply Knowledge & Learning

throw hands say, thus no use trying change anything. -
can acknowledge change extremely hard impossible, circumstances


can change, yet striving better human beings still worthwhile
endeavor. correct? - Absolutely. simply knowledge, either
experience making end right neurobiology class taught
change can happen within framework mechanistic neurobiology.
now open made optimistic good news world around you.
likely inspired that, resistant getting
discouraged bad news, simply now understand possible. - Mm-hmm,
yeah, somebody spent much career working hippocampus,
assume believer neuroplasticity, neural circuits can change
response experience, so-called top-down mechanisms
prefrontal cortex talking can play role there,
decision try change pursuit knowledge pursuit experience
can shape circuitry, therefore make us different machines, speak. - Yeah.
not can say prenatal hormone exposure changed way brain
constructed, learning prenatal hormone exposure can change construction
brain will change brain right now, think
intentions came from. Wow, maybe something it. knowledge
knowledge effector itself. - important powerful
statement hear. think many people think tool, doesn't involve pill
protocol, useless. certainly pills protocols
useful variety context variety things, idea knowledge itself,
whereas put it, knowledge knowledge tool, think important
concept people embed minds. And, listen, grateful discussion
raising topics. think people, many people know work
testosterone, stress, covered today, work freewill
idea hopeless total control. think realizing
listening neither true, solution resides

01:23:44 Robert’s New Book: “Determined: Science Life Without Free Will”

understanding freewill lack it, [laughs] also neuroplasticity.
working book freewill, willing tell us little bit
book process can look forward to? - Yeah,
going really slow. Title is, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill."


essentially first half book trying convince reader, okay, not
no freewill whatsoever, least lot less normally assumed.
going standard arguments freewill, doesn't make sense
21st century science? led reading lot frustrating
philosophers basically willing admit stuff made like atoms
molecules. like physical reality sort world, not just relying
magic, believe freewill magical reasons, doesn't make
sense. Okay, first half book hopefully convince people
much less freewill used think. second half gigantic
juncture built around fact haven't thought freewill since like
adolescent. despite thinking way, still absolutely no idea
supposed function belief. supposed go everyday life
anything feel entitled isn't true? angers hatreds feel aren't justified,
no thing appropriate, blame punishment praise reward,
none makes sense, somebody like even compliments haircut,
conditioned say, oh, thanks, something do.
supposed function that? second half wrestling that,
punchline is, going incredibly hard. think going
hard subtract notion freewill making sense like serial murderers,
going thousand times harder making sense somebody says "good job"
you. [Andrew laughs] exact reality sort
interpretations. going incredibly hard, nonetheless look
history subtracted notion agency sorts realms
blame, starting thinking witches caused hailstorms 500 years ago notion
psychodynamically screwed mothers cause schizophrenia, done it.
done endless number times, able subtract sense volition
understanding world works around us. don't murderers running
amuck street, society hasn't collapsed puddle, fact,
humane society. good news possible done repeatedly
past, going hard hell. hard hell try write
coherently, [laughs] discovering, going slowly. - Well, speak many, many
people say really excited book done will
patiently wait, great excitement book, "Determined". said title,
correct? - Yeah, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill". seems like


can't publish book days without sub-title, it? - Fantastic. Well,
excited read book. grateful conversation today, learned
ton. Every time speak learn, really pleasure delight
interact today previous years, say, colleagues.
thank again, Robert, everything hard, hard work
thinking put work clear put lot hard work

absolutely fascinated this. couple questions, is,
normally associate testosterone males, course, females make testosterone
well adrenals presumably elsewhere too. guessing looked hard
enough, probably find sources androgens females. Can
say general contours effects aggression also pertain females?
suppose ask particular female-female aggression,
exist many species, female-male agregression well maternal aggression,
robust aspect evolution, course, mother will, angry mother
animal kind protecting young truly dangerous, best sense word.
- type post-parturition, period birth aggression estrogen,
progesterone, sorts things. Female aggression, rest time
testosterone major player much lower level average. average,
one always say, basically punchlines. females, lower
levels testosterone essential typical levels aggression sexual behavior.
Nonetheless, not causing it, not sensitive small individual differences.
exact thing. can get way over-impressed

00:24:05 Testosterone: Challenge Hypothesis

importance androgens females just readily males. - line
that, conceptualize testosterone? realize isn't single sentence
can capture hormone effects hormones many different
slow fast effects brain, glands own, glands
produce them. heard talk testosterone today years,
start get impression misunderstood molecule [laughs] human
health universe, clearly something powerful. shifting way
certain neural circuits work, adjusting gain amygdala, described,
certainly things well. truism testosterone like,
relationship effort relationship resilience, way maybe will help
people sort think think testosterone? - Yeah. Maybe
three separate answers that. first one is, think fair summary think
comes motivated strong behaviors, testosterone make
whatever already are. me, sexual arousal, libido, aggressiveness,
spontaneous aggression, reactive aggression, things sort. upping volume


things already strongly there. Second way think is, well, like
favorite finding testosterone. wonderful work guy,
John Wingfield, one best behavioral endocrinologists there.
20 years ago formulated called Challenge Hypothesis Testosterone
Action. testosterone do? Testosterone secrete
status challenged, makes likely behaviors
needed hold onto status. Okay, totally boringly straightforward
baboon. somebody challenging high rank, appropriate response
part going aggression. right, just got back door,
testosterone aggression, again. get humans, humans lots
different ways achieving maintaining status. need go like
fancy private school's annual auction, will see half-drunk alpha
males competing see can give money away show conspicuous
like property have. setting like that, mean, haven't able take
urine samples, times, unfortunately, shows flip side it.
species hands status different sort way, testosterone going
boost also. Okay, generates totally nutty prediction. Wow, take people
circumstance, say playing economic game get status trustworthy
generous interactions game. give people testosterone,
make generous? absolutely case. Totally cool
finding. showing you, don't know, basically took whole bunch Buddhist
monks shot testosterone, get competitive
random acts kindness. societal problem
much aggression, first culprit look not testosterone, first look
hand much damn elevated status aggression many
circumstances. find finding fantastic. Third thing subtlety
testosterone. Okay, like subtler behavioral effects, give testosterone
people become confident, become self-confident. Well,
good, people pay take sorts nonsensical self-help courses will boost
self-esteem. good thing unless testosterone makes confident,
inaccurate, likely barrel wrong decisions. shown
economic game play testosterone making confident makes less
cooperative needs cooperate top own.
Testosterone makes people cocky impulsive. might great one setting,


is, absolutely sure army get
country three days. hell, start World War I, get big surprise it.
Testosterone altering risk assessment beforehand probably played big role kind
miscalculation.

00:29:20 Dopamine Impacts Testosterone & Motivation

- Super-interesting. always think testosterone dopamine close cousins
brain, not just relationship pituitary
hypothalamus. That, course, also dopamine's salient role creating
bias towards exteroception. somebody takes drug, increases
dopamine, chockablock full dopamine. tend, want highlight 'tend'
is, really generalizing here, tend focus outward goals,
things beyond boundaries skin. testosterone seems bit
same, tends put us similar mode perceiving outside world ways
asking questions like, relate species? relate
goals? anything can better conceptualize relationship
testosterone dopamine motivation? just take us
alleyways of, neural pathways hypothalamus? fine too. - Well,
think got lots sort massive revisionism dopamine. Everyone,
since pharaohs got brought taught dopamine pleasure
reward. turns isn't, anticipation reward, generating
motivation, goal-directed behavior needed go get reward.
know it, using like elevated dopamine, entire life motivate
whatever going get like entry heaven after-life kind of, sort
thing. really motivation. testosterone even individuals
not aggressive testosterone replacement often helpful thing
aging males increases energy, increases sense thereness, presence
alertness increases motivation. whole aspect, takes us
motivation get like go, hand lots soup soup kitchen
homeless people, get go ethnically cleanse village. got much
makeup testosterone got onboard. activating
energetic sense, testosterone within minutes increases glucose uptake skeletal
muscle. just awake alert that, lot


dopamine does. one might predict then, getting just right levels
testosterone infused bloodstream feels great lab rats. will lever press
get infused range optimizes dopamine release. is,
absolutely right, deeply intertwined. - Yeah, beautiful biology there.

00:32:32 Estrogen: Improves Brain & Longevity TIMING KEY

love way encapsulate relationship. want ask estrogen,
don't hear estrogen often, always interesting now
public facing education, testosterone controversial molecule, just say
almost controversial. [laughs] [Robert laughs] estrogen doesn't seem hold
controversial weight, yet estrogen powerful effects
animal brain human brain males females. Men not want
estrogen go low. Terrible things happen, will lose cognitive function, libido
can drop. men need estrogen well, perhaps maybe can put filter
estrogen testosterone. general themes estrogen
people aware think generally misunderstood? really
feelings empathy making us sensitive? sense not. - No,
context dependent. estrogen giving birth playing central
role wanting shred face somebody getting close kittens kind
thing, know not just warm, fuzzy, empathic kind stuff. Estrogen lots
ways summarized by, got choice matter lot
estrogen bloodstream not, go lot estrogen. enhances
cognition, exactly said, stimulates neurogenesis hippocampus,
increases glucose oxygen delivery, protects dementia, decreases
inflammatory oxidative damage blood vessels, good protecting
cardiovascular disease contrast testosterone, making everyone
things worse. springs minefield question, is,
post-menopausal estrogen? sorts lab studies non-human primates
suggested keep estrogen levels high monkey's equivalent
menopause. going keep brain health lot better decreasing risk
dementia, stroke, every thing. Estrogen great antioxidant, that.
90s think Healy, forgetting name, first female
head NIH, Bernadine Healy set massive prospective human study,


going biggest one times, looking pluses minuses post-
menopausal estrogen. tens thousands women, was...
cut study short seeing was, estrogen not
normal bad stuff expect terms decalcification stuff,
increasing risk cardiovascular disease, increasing risk stroke,
increasing risk dementia. ground halt everybody,
stopped study front page news everybody panned point. nobody
make sense spending last 20 years studying exact
thing primates seeing protective effects. explanation turned
one things like law unexpected consequences. Okay,
menopause women, lasts different lengths time, may factor going
come. know what, not start giving study subjects estrogen
totally past menopause. got lag time between, shift
sorts estrogen receptor patterns, bad effects come from.
- Wow! - monkey studies involved just maintaining ovulatory levels
post-menopausal period. get great effects. Estrogen one
greatest predictors protection Alzheimer's disease, that, needs
physiological. Just keep continuing body long time
versus let whole thing shutdown suddenly like try fire coal stoves
bottom basement kind thing, get going, get utterly different
outcomes. caused lot human health consequences people suddenly
decided estrogen fact neurologically endangering post-menopausally. - Wow,
fascinating. never thought steroid hormone receptors not
binding estrogen, devoid estrogen binding, say, set off
opposite biochemical cascades. Fascinating. guess raises question
testosterone replacement too, whether not people [laughs] talk doctor
long. Men women talk physicians long avoid these,
whatever happening periods isn't sufficient testosterone and/or
estrogen. sounds like cause longer-term problems even therapies
introduced. - Two additional misery slash complications. So, okay, trying
understand, look women history without post-menopausal estrogen
replacement done great. seeing 20 years later, estrogen
predictor decreased risk Alzheimer's. got start trying
unpacking prospective type studies. much estrogen? times? Estrogen


catchall term bunch hormones, estrone, estradiol, estriol. much one
them? Natural synthetic? Go try figure out. second
complication is, often hard say anything estrogen outside
context progesterone doing. often not absolute levels either,
ratio two. complicated endocrine system
testosterone. generate dramatic cyclicity like no male
hypothalamus ever dream off. much, much complicated system, thus,
lot complicated understand,

00:39:40 Testosterone & Sperm Counts Males Really Dropping?

let alone like figure ideal benefits it. - Yeah. don't know
make literature dropping rates testosterone endocrine disruptors.
Berkeley Tyrone Hayes published data frogs drinking
water various locations throughout United States, not just California,
seeing severe endocrine disruption blockade or, androgen receptors
sorts issues. hear time now sperm counts
dropping, endocrine disruptors birth control
water, drinking water. starts sound little crazy, yet also
fooled by, guess good example be, lot crazy stuff
world online terrible stuff highly processed foods. yet got
respectable people, endocrinologists UCSF like Robert Lustig saying, yeah, lot
hidden sugars emulsifiers, causing real problems.
become open-minded question. so, suffering drops
sperm counts testosterone estrogen fertility consequence endocrine
disruptors environments food, social reasons? anything
can hang hat like real data confident in? just mess? -
No, phenomenon appear quite real. Cross-sectional studies, human
populations, still don't understand one first things Hayes
spotted. Decreasing testicle size crocodiles. [Andrew laughs] Go figure
one first contributions this. think phenomenon absolutely real.
left two classic challenges, correlated
something broad environmental toxins. ones, much, when, etc.?
one always being, well, okay, dropping dropping enough make difference.


big effect this? juries still out. - Yeah,
area know lot interest in, got groups people won't
touch receipt store BPAs inks the...
[laughs] got people don't care things. fascinating area.

00:42:15 Stress Mitigation & Sense Control

hope biology will done soon. like briefly return stress.
described study two rats, one running wheel voluntarily, one
basically stuck running wheel, forced run anytime, rat number one runs.
one case rat voluntarily exercising. [laughs] case, rat
forced go PE class, speak, really, seeing divergent effects
biology. like just touch use kind case study stress
mitigation general. rather obsessed colleague, David Spiegel, Associate
Chair Psychiatry Stanford obsessed question of, humans can start
mitigate stress? think stress mitigation
individuals families culture try encourage people
mitigate stress, ways not going turn us rat number two,
forced mitigate stress therefore becomes stressful.
[laughs] - see is, rat number one gets benefits exercise. Rat
number two gets downsides severe stress exact muscle
expenditure movements going on. Perfectly yoked, great example
interpretation head. haven't kept literature, bet you, rat
number two whole lot activity amygdala rat number one.
Okay, stress mitigation. Anything say preface with,
reasonably good telling people going happen don't manage
stress, terrible actually like managing stress advising manage that.
much better bad news aspect it. see is, now just classic
literature, half century old, sort showing building blocks stress. Not,
ooh, step outside gored elephant, can grow
experience? doesn't kill makes stronger.
stress response, realm gray zone ambiguous social
interactions, sort thing. people massive stress responses, others not
all, between, enjoy it. Like building blocks of, makes


psychological stress stressful? first one exactly brought
running study. sense control? sense control makes stressors less
stressful. running wheel shows studies you, lab rat
college freshman volunteer trained pressing lever, less likely
get shock. today lever working away unbeknownst
lever turned off, no effect shock frequency,
think control, less stress response. rat
day-in day-out, less likely get ulcer. sense
control. related sense predictability. Rat get shocked, human gets
shocked, whatever, scenario either shocks come now then,
shocks come now then, 10 seconds little warning light comes on.
get warning light, shocks distressful. got predictability
not getting warning lights, second half second away
next shock. get warning light, know isn't one, got
least 10 seconds worth relaxation. know coming, can prepare
coping responses, best afterward know finally safe,
can recover it. enormously protective. Others outlet frustration,
take rat getting shocked, run running wheel,
protective thing, voluntarily. got rat can gnaw bar
wood, stressor less stressful. Unfortunately, rat primate human
stressed, ability aggressively dump somebody smaller weaker
also reduces stress response. fact displacement aggression reduces
stress accounts huge percent triggers like unhappiness.
variables, get social support well. good one. Interpreting circumstances
good news rather bad. Hurray, got simple sort like take
home recipe go get much control much predictability many
outlets much social support possible, going just fine.
go that, recipe total disaster much, much
subtle that. one great example, okay, getting shocks, want
warning beforehand, get little warning light 10 seconds shock,
wonderfully protective. Get warning light one second shock doesn't
anything. not enough time get psychological benefits
anticipation. Now instead, gets little warning coming two minutes
shock, going make things worse not going sitting


like reveling sort sense predictability, soon going be, oh.
going sitting two minutes saying, damn, comes. Predictive
information works narrow domain. Similarly, control. want
sense control face stress? answer is, mild moderate
stressor happening then, sense control completely
independent reality whether control not, face mild
moderate stressors, sense control gets interpreted as, wow, look much worse
things been. Thank God, control, top master fate.
contrast, major stressor, arbitrary sense control make
think, oh God, look much better been. prevented it.
know intuitively like face people's worst stressors.
Nobody stopped car way kids suddenly jumped out. wouldn't
mattered gotten doctor month ago, instead now,
wouldn't made any... didn't actually control. see is,
absolutely want huge sense control mild moderate stressors,
especially ones result good outcome. Hooray, me, face horrible
stressors, want like self-deception, like truth beauty don't
necessarily go hand-in-hand point. stress management techniques
impact control predictability wind far worse neutral preaching
somebody homeless somebody terminal cancer, somebody
refugee. Tell neurotic middle-class person psychological tools
turn hell heaven. truth that. thing somebody
going real hell, just privileged heartlessness
doesn't work. outlets, outlets damaging,
not good way mitigate stress. Social support, confusing mere
acquaintances real social support, going rug pulled
point. mistaking social support being, going bitching
moaning demanding supportiveness everyone around rather
reciprocally, not going work well either. not simple.
not nothing lots us really lousy. It, like good friends things
like that, takes lot work right? wrong may
temporarily seem like great thing, turns completely misplaced
faith, going feeling worse started.



00:51:35 Best Buffer Stress

- Interesting. days, lot interest using physical practices mitigate
stress, trying get ruminating, extent take control neural
circuits brain using exercise using breathing hypnosis. And, course,
hypnosis mental component well. thoughts stress mitigation
standpoint of, okay, don't want rat number two, want select
something ourselves, take initiative ourselves. forced
exercising not, actually negative health effect perhaps. need
pick something like, need take control it. terms supporting
people, touched bit. best way support people?
talk stressful thing? mean, not asking play psychologist here,
find divergent data this. can spin lather ruminating
something. language seems like wonderful tool, also fairly
deprived tool doesn't really get core physiology like something
like breathing would. thoughts more, lack better way put
it, head-centered, cognitive approaches stress mitigation versus kind going
core physiology. Cold showers now even thing extent just get
people stress acclimated, voluntarily taking cold showers. - makes sense
physiologically, preconditioning real stressors come. terms
bring up, oh, transcendental meditation, mindfulness, exercise, prayer, sort reflecting
gratitude, sort thing. Collectively work average, work
terms of, can lower heart rate cholesterol levels sorts good
outcomes, compromise us. One exactly caveat comes
running wheel study is, doesn't matter many friends swear stress
management technique. makes want scream head off 10
seconds, not one going work you. read fine print
testimonials, got something works you. Another one stress
management type techniques work, can't save weekend, can't
save stuck hold phone Muzak two minutes.
got something stop virtually, daily every
day, spend 20, 30 minutes it. see coming
like 80/20 rule economics. 80/20, 80% complaints store come
20% customers, things like that. see is, entire life consists


every single thing shoulders, can't say no 24/7. stopped
finally said, wellbeing important enough finally get say no
stuff can't say no to. going every day 20 minutes,
whatever stress management technique 20 minutes sort
knows what, already 80% way simply decided
wellbeing important enough going stop every single day
priority. exactly finding find people chronic
depression untreated merely calling getting appointment see mental
health professional, people start feeling better already evidence
activated, matter enough this, conceive
actually good outcome rather hopeless one. Just something
meditative reflective every day so, hardly even matters one
doing. comes thus another warning, not trust anybody
says, scientifically proven brand stress management works
better ones. Just watch wallet point. - Yeah, amen. think one
core goals lab David Spiegel's lab, know worked
David published papers David well really try find
various entry points thing call autonomic nervous system
stress system, systems gone unchecked really can take us
dark path. idea many entry points really one keeps,
data keep telling us again. no magic breathing tool
exercise, variety one those. And, again, come back idea
one select one make space for, one
hopefully enjoy going work best terms physiology. - [mumbles]
benign people stuck around you.

00:57:04 Power Perception, Choice & Individual Differences

- Right, right, absolutely. brings question of, find amazing
perceive event, whether not chose event not can
incredible different effects circuitry brain circuitry body
biology cells. ways boggles mind, like can decision made
presumably prefrontal cortex, although parts brain well, can
change essentially polarity response body. And, mean, talked


Type personalities there. don't go detail
sake time, interesting effects endothelial cells. mean, literally
size of, [laughs] portals blood opposite direction, depending
whether not somebody wants situation highly motivated person. Maybe
just give us top contour think really illustrates
principle beautifully. maybe would, just speculate
brain might switch turn one experience terrible beneficial
beneficial terrible, really fascinating. - Well, need like tonight
going sleep lying bed nice drowsy
heart's beating nice slow, start thinking fact heart isn't going
beat forever. [Andrew laughs] imagine toes getting cold afterward
imagine flow blood coming halt clotting. going
something physiology point 99% mammals
running frantically. going turning sympathetic
stress response thought, emotions, memory. measure
just much cortex limbic system sends projections
autonomic regulators brain. can think autonomic regulatory neurons
action ways animals can like extremes environmental
circumstances. given autonomic rule, mean, big challenge
understanding gigantic individual differences. that's, talk
optimal amount stress, counts stimulation, general stress not
severe doesn't go long overall benevolence setting.
conditions, love stressed something unexpected
control predictability like really interesting plot turn movie watching.
great, get individual differences somehow accommodate
fact people, perfect stimulatory amount stress like getting
early Audubon birdwatching walk next Sunday morning. somebody else,
signing like mercenary Yemen. [Andrew laughs]

01:00:32 Context-Setting, Prefrontal Cortex & Hierarchy

tremendous individual differences swamp simple prescriptions. - Yeah,
prefrontal cortex, thinking machinery harbor, double-edged
sword. remarkable is, areas brain like hypothalamus


amygdala, sort like switches. mean, context gain
control. talked gain control testosterone, etc., really like
switches. mean, stimulate ventromedial hypothalamus, get right neurons,
animal will try kill even object sitting next it. tickle
neurons, it'll try mate object. mean, really wild. think
probably rules prefrontal cortex also, sounds like context plural
prefrontal cortex can draw probably infinite, probably learn
perceive threat anything. Whether not another group whether not
science whether not somebody's version shape earth versus
another. mean, like, can plug anything system give enough data,
think sounds like drive fear response love response.
overstepping? - [laughs] mixed horribly ambivalent one changing
millisecond, like mutually contradictory. No, absolutely case
prefrontal cortex, regretted like wasted 30 years
life studying hippocampus shoot studied prefrontal cortex
much interesting does, contextual stuff.
ways not okay lie setting, great thing another.
not okay kill unless them, get medal. not,
social context moral relativity situational ethic stuff, prefrontal cortex
got master that. winds meaning place brain
anywhere say perception things can powerfully influence
reality coming you. - Yeah. - mean, great example, just harking back
testosterone. Okay, exercise boosts testosterone levels. exercise
success exercise failure? literature back 80s looking
outcomes marathons. testosterone rise people win
losers? Wrestling matches. Things sort simple prediction answer
wound being, didn't see simple answer. Okay, win marathon, not
necessarily predictor increased testosterone. about? find
like winner testosterone decreases, find guy came 73rd
massive testosterone increase. Whoa, about?
far human subtlety. guy won race decline testosterone
came three minutes later really, really expecting.
everybody now going writing hill. guy
came 73rd boost testosterone assuming dead


heart attack third mile, [Andrew laughs] instead managed finish.
interpretive stuff going there, prefrontal cortex about. -
Amazing, raises question cognitive flexibility, Can tell
something good us even not enjoying it? can wriggle around
corners choosing exercise the... Personally not big fan long bouts
meditation, benefited tremendously things like dedicated breathing
shorter rounds meditation. Can tell good wriggle around
corner get physiology working way want? cognitive
flexibility? Can third place runner tell myself, well, least came in,
wanted win badly. primary goal, another goal beat
previous time, that. so, [laughs] mean, it's... extent can
toggle relationship prefrontal cortex primitive
systems? - Well, enormous amount. example, low hierarchy
generally bad health like every mammal there, including us,
something special, can part multiple hierarchies time.
maybe low ranking one them, extremely high ranking
another, like crappiest job corporation, captain
softball team year company. better bet somebody
going find sorts ways decide nine five Monday Fridays, just stupid
paying bills. really matters prestige weekend. poorer,
deacon church here. can play sorts psychological
games that. One like consistent, reliable ones need
use frontal cortex like crazy is, somebody something rotten need
attribute it. answer is, something wrong, hmm, rotten.
Always always will constitutional explanation. something
rotten somebody, explain afterward? situational one. tired,
stressed sort setting, misunderstood this. best excusing
bad things access inner lives got
prefrontal cortexes great coming situational explanation rather than,
hey, maybe just like selfish rotten human, need change.
prefrontal cortex, every time, don't let somebody merge lane
front us, even though curse somebody thing and...
Endlessly. - love it. statement fact can select multiple
hierarchies participate in. seems like particularly important one nowadays


social media prevalent. know not particularly active social
media although might pleasantly, don't know unpleasantly surprised find
lot positive discussion work, don't even
need there. just continue discuss [laughs] work.
interesting social media found context very, broad. mean,
one argue one selects follow news articles reading,
etc. can create kind funneling information can dangerous.
verification crazy ideas even just less exposure new ideas. also
idea social media incredibly broad context. scroll feed,
no longer like eighth grade classroom office faculty
meeting. exposed thousands, not millions contexts, meal,
soccer game, person's body, person's intellect. YouTube another example.
vast, vast landscape. context completely mishmash whereas assuming
evolved. think evolve contexts much constrained.
interacted limited number individuals limited number different domains,
seasons tended constrain us all. course, got phones televisions,
started expand, now ever, brain, prefrontal cortex
sense exist multiple hierarchies essentially wicked
infinity. think might interacting primitive
systems aspects biology? - Well, think get is, ways
punchline of, human humans, use
exact blueprint, hormones, kinases, receptors,
same, everything built exact stuff species
there, go use completely novel way. usually terms
able abstract stuff space time dramatic ways. So, okay, low
ranking baboon can feel badly just like killed rabbit
eat higher ranking guy boots off takes away you,
feel crummy stressful unhappy. exact
things like brain bodies losing sense self-esteem,
can watching movie character screen feeling inadequate compared
like wonderful attractive are. can somebody driving past us
expensive car, don't even see face, can feel belittled
socioeconomic status. can watch like Lifestyles Rich Famous
read Bezos to. reason, decide life less fulfilling


didn't fly space 11 minutes. can feel miserable
ways no organism can, simply can
meaningful social networks include like party reading Facebook
weren't invited taking place Singapore, don't know
people, nonetheless, somehow means

01:11:20 Dr. Sapolsky Accomplishes Deep Thinking

feel less content turned be. take steps life
actively restrict contexts think live contemplate order
enhance creative life, intellectual life? steps actively take? -
Well, actively don't know make use anything [laughs] social media.
guess counts thus actively chosen not learn how.
case certainly last year half, like lots people, gone stretches
managed sort enforce moratorium looking news,
wonderfully freeing. think larger sense though, addition
neurobiologist, sort spent decades spending part year studying wild
baboons national park East Africa. spend three months year without
electricity, without phone calls, going 12 hours day without saying word
somebody. finally would, somebody nomadic pastoralist guy
different language. Yeah, 90% like insightful thinking anything
laboratory three months year, not one lab, not
inundated stuff. - Well, think shifting trend towards trying create
narrowing context that... like see, niece, 14-years-old
friends good putting phones away. say, not
going phones interaction, especially after... realized still
somewhat this. unclear headed,

01:13:17 Free Will?

2020 restrictive separated friends. Now it's,
really focus together not bring elements phones.
brings great hope generation, [laughs] maybe will...
knows, maybe run off study baboons, need field researchers.


along lines choice, like shift gears slightly talk freewill,
ability make choices all. - Well, personal way left field inflammatory
stance is, don't think shred freewill despite 95% philosophers.
think probably majority neuroscientists saying freewill least
circumstances. don't think all. reason is,
something, behave, make choice, whatever. understand
that, intention come from? Part due like sensory
environment previous minute. hormone levels
bloodstream morning. whether wonderful
stressful last three months sort neuroplasticity happened. Part
hormone levels exposed fetus. Part culture ancestors
came with, thus parented kid.
there, can understand behavior coming without incorporating
those. point, not relevant factors,
ultimately one factor. talking evolution
behavior, definition also talking genetics. talking
genes behavior, definition talking brain
constructed proteins coded for. talking like mood
disorder now, talking sense efficacy getting five-year-
old. intertwined. look influences, basically like
challenge is, show neuron just caused behavior, show network
neurons just caused behavior. show nothing just
influenced anything sensory environment one second ago
evolution species. no space fit freewill concept
winds brain, not brain. simply no wiggle room
there. - can appreciate behaviors choices consequences
long line dominoes fell prior behavior. possible can
intervene domino effect, speak. words, can recognition
fact genes heritability, epigenome that, hormonal context,
historical context. Can knowledge give small shard
freewill? Meaning, allow say, ah, okay, accept choices
somewhat predetermined, yet knowing gives additional layer
control? philosophical biological universe works? - Nah.
can produce wonderfully positive belief change can happen. Even


traumatic change, even worst circumstances, unlikely people, change
can happen, things can change. Don't fatalistic, don't decide
mechanistic, biological machines nothing can ever... Change can happen,
people go off rails translating into, can change ourselves. don't,
can't no freewill. However, can changed circumstance.
point is, like look Aplysia, sea slug learned retract gill
response shock tail, can like conditioning, Pavlovian conditioning
it, learned, behavior changed environment. hear
news something like horrifically depressing going on, refugees wherever.
result, feel little bit helpless less sense efficacy
world, behaviors changed. Okay, okay, yeah, guess that,
remarkable thing is, exact neurobiology. signal transduction
pathways happening sea snail incorporate exact kinases
proteases phosphatases mammalian fear
conditioning, alert, conserved. exact thing, simply
playing obviously much, much fancier domain. learned
change possible despite understanding mechanistically can't change
volitionally, understand change possible, just
changed ability brain respond optimistic stimuli. changed
ability brain now send direction exposed
information will seem cheerful rather depressing. Oh God, amazing,
Nelson Mandela Martin Luther king folks did. Wow,
adverse circumstances, able do. Maybe can also, maybe can go
read people like get even data points change
neurochemistry, responses different now. tilted little bit
direction feeling like can make difference instead damn
hopeless. enormous change can happen, last thing come
view of, nothing less sum biology interactions
environment,

01:20:50 Apply Knowledge & Learning

throw hands say, thus no use trying change anything. -
can acknowledge change extremely hard impossible, circumstances


can change, yet striving better human beings still worthwhile
endeavor. correct? - Absolutely. simply knowledge, either
experience making end right neurobiology class taught
change can happen within framework mechanistic neurobiology.
now open made optimistic good news world around you.
likely inspired that, resistant getting
discouraged bad news, simply now understand possible. - Mm-hmm,
yeah, somebody spent much career working hippocampus,
assume believer neuroplasticity, neural circuits can change
response experience, so-called top-down mechanisms
prefrontal cortex talking can play role there,
decision try change pursuit knowledge pursuit experience
can shape circuitry, therefore make us different machines, speak. - Yeah.
not can say prenatal hormone exposure changed way brain
constructed, learning prenatal hormone exposure can change construction
brain will change brain right now, think
intentions came from. Wow, maybe something it. knowledge
knowledge effector itself. - important powerful
statement hear. think many people think tool, doesn't involve pill
protocol, useless. certainly pills protocols
useful variety context variety things, idea knowledge itself,
whereas put it, knowledge knowledge tool, think important
concept people embed minds. And, listen, grateful discussion
raising topics. think people, many people know work
testosterone, stress, covered today, work freewill
idea hopeless total control. think realizing
listening neither true, solution resides

01:23:44 Robert’s New Book: “Determined: Science Life Without Free Will”

understanding freewill lack it, [laughs] also neuroplasticity.
working book freewill, willing tell us little bit
book process can look forward to? - Yeah,
going really slow. Title is, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill."


essentially first half book trying convince reader, okay, not
no freewill whatsoever, least lot less normally assumed.
going standard arguments freewill, doesn't make sense
21st century science? led reading lot frustrating
philosophers basically willing admit stuff made like atoms
molecules. like physical reality sort world, not just relying
magic, believe freewill magical reasons, doesn't make
sense. Okay, first half book hopefully convince people
much less freewill used think. second half gigantic
juncture built around fact haven't thought freewill since like
adolescent. despite thinking way, still absolutely no idea
supposed function belief. supposed go everyday life
anything feel entitled isn't true? angers hatreds feel aren't justified,
no thing appropriate, blame punishment praise reward,
none makes sense, somebody like even compliments haircut,
conditioned say, oh, thanks, something do.
supposed function that? second half wrestling that,
punchline is, going incredibly hard. think going
hard subtract notion freewill making sense like serial murderers,
going thousand times harder making sense somebody says "good job"
you. [Andrew laughs] exact reality sort
interpretations. going incredibly hard, nonetheless look
history subtracted notion agency sorts realms
blame, starting thinking witches caused hailstorms 500 years ago notion
psychodynamically screwed mothers cause schizophrenia, done it.
done endless number times, able subtract sense volition
understanding world works around us. don't murderers running
amuck street, society hasn't collapsed puddle, fact,
humane society. good news possible done repeatedly
past, going hard hell. hard hell try write
coherently, [laughs] discovering, going slowly. - Well, speak many, many
people say really excited book done will
patiently wait, great excitement book, "Determined". said title,
correct? - Yeah, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill". seems like


can't publish book days without sub-title, it? - Fantastic. Well,
excited read book. grateful conversation today, learned
ton. Every time speak learn, really pleasure delight
interact today previous years, say, colleagues.
thank again, Robert, everything hard, hard work
thinking put work clear put lot hard work

things already strongly there. Second way think is, well, like
favorite finding testosterone. wonderful work guy,
John Wingfield, one best behavioral endocrinologists there.
20 years ago formulated called Challenge Hypothesis Testosterone
Action. testosterone do? Testosterone secrete
status challenged, makes likely behaviors
needed hold onto status. Okay, totally boringly straightforward
baboon. somebody challenging high rank, appropriate response
part going aggression. right, just got back door,
testosterone aggression, again. get humans, humans lots
different ways achieving maintaining status. need go like
fancy private school's annual auction, will see half-drunk alpha
males competing see can give money away show conspicuous
like property have. setting like that, mean, haven't able take
urine samples, times, unfortunately, shows flip side it.
species hands status different sort way, testosterone going
boost also. Okay, generates totally nutty prediction. Wow, take people
circumstance, say playing economic game get status trustworthy
generous interactions game. give people testosterone,
make generous? absolutely case. Totally cool
finding. showing you, don't know, basically took whole bunch Buddhist
monks shot testosterone, get competitive
random acts kindness. societal problem
much aggression, first culprit look not testosterone, first look
hand much damn elevated status aggression many
circumstances. find finding fantastic. Third thing subtlety
testosterone. Okay, like subtler behavioral effects, give testosterone
people become confident, become self-confident. Well,
good, people pay take sorts nonsensical self-help courses will boost
self-esteem. good thing unless testosterone makes confident,
inaccurate, likely barrel wrong decisions. shown
economic game play testosterone making confident makes less
cooperative needs cooperate top own.
Testosterone makes people cocky impulsive. might great one setting,


is, absolutely sure army get
country three days. hell, start World War I, get big surprise it.
Testosterone altering risk assessment beforehand probably played big role kind
miscalculation.

00:29:20 Dopamine Impacts Testosterone & Motivation

- Super-interesting. always think testosterone dopamine close cousins
brain, not just relationship pituitary
hypothalamus. That, course, also dopamine's salient role creating
bias towards exteroception. somebody takes drug, increases
dopamine, chockablock full dopamine. tend, want highlight 'tend'
is, really generalizing here, tend focus outward goals,
things beyond boundaries skin. testosterone seems bit
same, tends put us similar mode perceiving outside world ways
asking questions like, relate species? relate
goals? anything can better conceptualize relationship
testosterone dopamine motivation? just take us
alleyways of, neural pathways hypothalamus? fine too. - Well,
think got lots sort massive revisionism dopamine. Everyone,
since pharaohs got brought taught dopamine pleasure
reward. turns isn't, anticipation reward, generating
motivation, goal-directed behavior needed go get reward.
know it, using like elevated dopamine, entire life motivate
whatever going get like entry heaven after-life kind of, sort
thing. really motivation. testosterone even individuals
not aggressive testosterone replacement often helpful thing
aging males increases energy, increases sense thereness, presence
alertness increases motivation. whole aspect, takes us
motivation get like go, hand lots soup soup kitchen
homeless people, get go ethnically cleanse village. got much
makeup testosterone got onboard. activating
energetic sense, testosterone within minutes increases glucose uptake skeletal
muscle. just awake alert that, lot


dopamine does. one might predict then, getting just right levels
testosterone infused bloodstream feels great lab rats. will lever press
get infused range optimizes dopamine release. is,
absolutely right, deeply intertwined. - Yeah, beautiful biology there.

00:32:32 Estrogen: Improves Brain & Longevity TIMING KEY

love way encapsulate relationship. want ask estrogen,
don't hear estrogen often, always interesting now
public facing education, testosterone controversial molecule, just say
almost controversial. [laughs] [Robert laughs] estrogen doesn't seem hold
controversial weight, yet estrogen powerful effects
animal brain human brain males females. Men not want
estrogen go low. Terrible things happen, will lose cognitive function, libido
can drop. men need estrogen well, perhaps maybe can put filter
estrogen testosterone. general themes estrogen
people aware think generally misunderstood? really
feelings empathy making us sensitive? sense not. - No,
context dependent. estrogen giving birth playing central
role wanting shred face somebody getting close kittens kind
thing, know not just warm, fuzzy, empathic kind stuff. Estrogen lots
ways summarized by, got choice matter lot
estrogen bloodstream not, go lot estrogen. enhances
cognition, exactly said, stimulates neurogenesis hippocampus,
increases glucose oxygen delivery, protects dementia, decreases
inflammatory oxidative damage blood vessels, good protecting
cardiovascular disease contrast testosterone, making everyone
things worse. springs minefield question, is,
post-menopausal estrogen? sorts lab studies non-human primates
suggested keep estrogen levels high monkey's equivalent
menopause. going keep brain health lot better decreasing risk
dementia, stroke, every thing. Estrogen great antioxidant, that.
90s think Healy, forgetting name, first female
head NIH, Bernadine Healy set massive prospective human study,


going biggest one times, looking pluses minuses post-
menopausal estrogen. tens thousands women, was...
cut study short seeing was, estrogen not
normal bad stuff expect terms decalcification stuff,
increasing risk cardiovascular disease, increasing risk stroke,
increasing risk dementia. ground halt everybody,
stopped study front page news everybody panned point. nobody
make sense spending last 20 years studying exact
thing primates seeing protective effects. explanation turned
one things like law unexpected consequences. Okay,
menopause women, lasts different lengths time, may factor going
come. know what, not start giving study subjects estrogen
totally past menopause. got lag time between, shift
sorts estrogen receptor patterns, bad effects come from.
- Wow! - monkey studies involved just maintaining ovulatory levels
post-menopausal period. get great effects. Estrogen one
greatest predictors protection Alzheimer's disease, that, needs
physiological. Just keep continuing body long time
versus let whole thing shutdown suddenly like try fire coal stoves
bottom basement kind thing, get going, get utterly different
outcomes. caused lot human health consequences people suddenly
decided estrogen fact neurologically endangering post-menopausally. - Wow,
fascinating. never thought steroid hormone receptors not
binding estrogen, devoid estrogen binding, say, set off
opposite biochemical cascades. Fascinating. guess raises question
testosterone replacement too, whether not people [laughs] talk doctor
long. Men women talk physicians long avoid these,
whatever happening periods isn't sufficient testosterone and/or
estrogen. sounds like cause longer-term problems even therapies
introduced. - Two additional misery slash complications. So, okay, trying
understand, look women history without post-menopausal estrogen
replacement done great. seeing 20 years later, estrogen
predictor decreased risk Alzheimer's. got start trying
unpacking prospective type studies. much estrogen? times? Estrogen


catchall term bunch hormones, estrone, estradiol, estriol. much one
them? Natural synthetic? Go try figure out. second
complication is, often hard say anything estrogen outside
context progesterone doing. often not absolute levels either,
ratio two. complicated endocrine system
testosterone. generate dramatic cyclicity like no male
hypothalamus ever dream off. much, much complicated system, thus,
lot complicated understand,

00:39:40 Testosterone & Sperm Counts Males Really Dropping?

let alone like figure ideal benefits it. - Yeah. don't know
make literature dropping rates testosterone endocrine disruptors.
Berkeley Tyrone Hayes published data frogs drinking
water various locations throughout United States, not just California,
seeing severe endocrine disruption blockade or, androgen receptors
sorts issues. hear time now sperm counts
dropping, endocrine disruptors birth control
water, drinking water. starts sound little crazy, yet also
fooled by, guess good example be, lot crazy stuff
world online terrible stuff highly processed foods. yet got
respectable people, endocrinologists UCSF like Robert Lustig saying, yeah, lot
hidden sugars emulsifiers, causing real problems.
become open-minded question. so, suffering drops
sperm counts testosterone estrogen fertility consequence endocrine
disruptors environments food, social reasons? anything
can hang hat like real data confident in? just mess? -
No, phenomenon appear quite real. Cross-sectional studies, human
populations, still don't understand one first things Hayes
spotted. Decreasing testicle size crocodiles. [Andrew laughs] Go figure
one first contributions this. think phenomenon absolutely real.
left two classic challenges, correlated
something broad environmental toxins. ones, much, when, etc.?
one always being, well, okay, dropping dropping enough make difference.


big effect this? juries still out. - Yeah,
area know lot interest in, got groups people won't
touch receipt store BPAs inks the...
[laughs] got people don't care things. fascinating area.

00:42:15 Stress Mitigation & Sense Control

hope biology will done soon. like briefly return stress.
described study two rats, one running wheel voluntarily, one
basically stuck running wheel, forced run anytime, rat number one runs.
one case rat voluntarily exercising. [laughs] case, rat
forced go PE class, speak, really, seeing divergent effects
biology. like just touch use kind case study stress
mitigation general. rather obsessed colleague, David Spiegel, Associate
Chair Psychiatry Stanford obsessed question of, humans can start
mitigate stress? think stress mitigation
individuals families culture try encourage people
mitigate stress, ways not going turn us rat number two,
forced mitigate stress therefore becomes stressful.
[laughs] - see is, rat number one gets benefits exercise. Rat
number two gets downsides severe stress exact muscle
expenditure movements going on. Perfectly yoked, great example
interpretation head. haven't kept literature, bet you, rat
number two whole lot activity amygdala rat number one.
Okay, stress mitigation. Anything say preface with,
reasonably good telling people going happen don't manage
stress, terrible actually like managing stress advising manage that.
much better bad news aspect it. see is, now just classic
literature, half century old, sort showing building blocks stress. Not,
ooh, step outside gored elephant, can grow
experience? doesn't kill makes stronger.
stress response, realm gray zone ambiguous social
interactions, sort thing. people massive stress responses, others not
all, between, enjoy it. Like building blocks of, makes


psychological stress stressful? first one exactly brought
running study. sense control? sense control makes stressors less
stressful. running wheel shows studies you, lab rat
college freshman volunteer trained pressing lever, less likely
get shock. today lever working away unbeknownst
lever turned off, no effect shock frequency,
think control, less stress response. rat
day-in day-out, less likely get ulcer. sense
control. related sense predictability. Rat get shocked, human gets
shocked, whatever, scenario either shocks come now then,
shocks come now then, 10 seconds little warning light comes on.
get warning light, shocks distressful. got predictability
not getting warning lights, second half second away
next shock. get warning light, know isn't one, got
least 10 seconds worth relaxation. know coming, can prepare
coping responses, best afterward know finally safe,
can recover it. enormously protective. Others outlet frustration,
take rat getting shocked, run running wheel,
protective thing, voluntarily. got rat can gnaw bar
wood, stressor less stressful. Unfortunately, rat primate human
stressed, ability aggressively dump somebody smaller weaker
also reduces stress response. fact displacement aggression reduces
stress accounts huge percent triggers like unhappiness.
variables, get social support well. good one. Interpreting circumstances
good news rather bad. Hurray, got simple sort like take
home recipe go get much control much predictability many
outlets much social support possible, going just fine.
go that, recipe total disaster much, much
subtle that. one great example, okay, getting shocks, want
warning beforehand, get little warning light 10 seconds shock,
wonderfully protective. Get warning light one second shock doesn't
anything. not enough time get psychological benefits
anticipation. Now instead, gets little warning coming two minutes
shock, going make things worse not going sitting


like reveling sort sense predictability, soon going be, oh.
going sitting two minutes saying, damn, comes. Predictive
information works narrow domain. Similarly, control. want
sense control face stress? answer is, mild moderate
stressor happening then, sense control completely
independent reality whether control not, face mild
moderate stressors, sense control gets interpreted as, wow, look much worse
things been. Thank God, control, top master fate.
contrast, major stressor, arbitrary sense control make
think, oh God, look much better been. prevented it.
know intuitively like face people's worst stressors.
Nobody stopped car way kids suddenly jumped out. wouldn't
mattered gotten doctor month ago, instead now,
wouldn't made any... didn't actually control. see is,
absolutely want huge sense control mild moderate stressors,
especially ones result good outcome. Hooray, me, face horrible
stressors, want like self-deception, like truth beauty don't
necessarily go hand-in-hand point. stress management techniques
impact control predictability wind far worse neutral preaching
somebody homeless somebody terminal cancer, somebody
refugee. Tell neurotic middle-class person psychological tools
turn hell heaven. truth that. thing somebody
going real hell, just privileged heartlessness
doesn't work. outlets, outlets damaging,
not good way mitigate stress. Social support, confusing mere
acquaintances real social support, going rug pulled
point. mistaking social support being, going bitching
moaning demanding supportiveness everyone around rather
reciprocally, not going work well either. not simple.
not nothing lots us really lousy. It, like good friends things
like that, takes lot work right? wrong may
temporarily seem like great thing, turns completely misplaced
faith, going feeling worse started.



00:51:35 Best Buffer Stress

- Interesting. days, lot interest using physical practices mitigate
stress, trying get ruminating, extent take control neural
circuits brain using exercise using breathing hypnosis. And, course,
hypnosis mental component well. thoughts stress mitigation
standpoint of, okay, don't want rat number two, want select
something ourselves, take initiative ourselves. forced
exercising not, actually negative health effect perhaps. need
pick something like, need take control it. terms supporting
people, touched bit. best way support people?
talk stressful thing? mean, not asking play psychologist here,
find divergent data this. can spin lather ruminating
something. language seems like wonderful tool, also fairly
deprived tool doesn't really get core physiology like something
like breathing would. thoughts more, lack better way put
it, head-centered, cognitive approaches stress mitigation versus kind going
core physiology. Cold showers now even thing extent just get
people stress acclimated, voluntarily taking cold showers. - makes sense
physiologically, preconditioning real stressors come. terms
bring up, oh, transcendental meditation, mindfulness, exercise, prayer, sort reflecting
gratitude, sort thing. Collectively work average, work
terms of, can lower heart rate cholesterol levels sorts good
outcomes, compromise us. One exactly caveat comes
running wheel study is, doesn't matter many friends swear stress
management technique. makes want scream head off 10
seconds, not one going work you. read fine print
testimonials, got something works you. Another one stress
management type techniques work, can't save weekend, can't
save stuck hold phone Muzak two minutes.
got something stop virtually, daily every
day, spend 20, 30 minutes it. see coming
like 80/20 rule economics. 80/20, 80% complaints store come
20% customers, things like that. see is, entire life consists


every single thing shoulders, can't say no 24/7. stopped
finally said, wellbeing important enough finally get say no
stuff can't say no to. going every day 20 minutes,
whatever stress management technique 20 minutes sort
knows what, already 80% way simply decided
wellbeing important enough going stop every single day
priority. exactly finding find people chronic
depression untreated merely calling getting appointment see mental
health professional, people start feeling better already evidence
activated, matter enough this, conceive
actually good outcome rather hopeless one. Just something
meditative reflective every day so, hardly even matters one
doing. comes thus another warning, not trust anybody
says, scientifically proven brand stress management works
better ones. Just watch wallet point. - Yeah, amen. think one
core goals lab David Spiegel's lab, know worked
David published papers David well really try find
various entry points thing call autonomic nervous system
stress system, systems gone unchecked really can take us
dark path. idea many entry points really one keeps,
data keep telling us again. no magic breathing tool
exercise, variety one those. And, again, come back idea
one select one make space for, one
hopefully enjoy going work best terms physiology. - [mumbles]
benign people stuck around you.

00:57:04 Power Perception, Choice & Individual Differences

- Right, right, absolutely. brings question of, find amazing
perceive event, whether not chose event not can
incredible different effects circuitry brain circuitry body
biology cells. ways boggles mind, like can decision made
presumably prefrontal cortex, although parts brain well, can
change essentially polarity response body. And, mean, talked


Type personalities there. don't go detail
sake time, interesting effects endothelial cells. mean, literally
size of, [laughs] portals blood opposite direction, depending
whether not somebody wants situation highly motivated person. Maybe
just give us top contour think really illustrates
principle beautifully. maybe would, just speculate
brain might switch turn one experience terrible beneficial
beneficial terrible, really fascinating. - Well, need like tonight
going sleep lying bed nice drowsy
heart's beating nice slow, start thinking fact heart isn't going
beat forever. [Andrew laughs] imagine toes getting cold afterward
imagine flow blood coming halt clotting. going
something physiology point 99% mammals
running frantically. going turning sympathetic
stress response thought, emotions, memory. measure
just much cortex limbic system sends projections
autonomic regulators brain. can think autonomic regulatory neurons
action ways animals can like extremes environmental
circumstances. given autonomic rule, mean, big challenge
understanding gigantic individual differences. that's, talk
optimal amount stress, counts stimulation, general stress not
severe doesn't go long overall benevolence setting.
conditions, love stressed something unexpected
control predictability like really interesting plot turn movie watching.
great, get individual differences somehow accommodate
fact people, perfect stimulatory amount stress like getting
early Audubon birdwatching walk next Sunday morning. somebody else,
signing like mercenary Yemen. [Andrew laughs]

01:00:32 Context-Setting, Prefrontal Cortex & Hierarchy

tremendous individual differences swamp simple prescriptions. - Yeah,
prefrontal cortex, thinking machinery harbor, double-edged
sword. remarkable is, areas brain like hypothalamus


amygdala, sort like switches. mean, context gain
control. talked gain control testosterone, etc., really like
switches. mean, stimulate ventromedial hypothalamus, get right neurons,
animal will try kill even object sitting next it. tickle
neurons, it'll try mate object. mean, really wild. think
probably rules prefrontal cortex also, sounds like context plural
prefrontal cortex can draw probably infinite, probably learn
perceive threat anything. Whether not another group whether not
science whether not somebody's version shape earth versus
another. mean, like, can plug anything system give enough data,
think sounds like drive fear response love response.
overstepping? - [laughs] mixed horribly ambivalent one changing
millisecond, like mutually contradictory. No, absolutely case
prefrontal cortex, regretted like wasted 30 years
life studying hippocampus shoot studied prefrontal cortex
much interesting does, contextual stuff.
ways not okay lie setting, great thing another.
not okay kill unless them, get medal. not,
social context moral relativity situational ethic stuff, prefrontal cortex
got master that. winds meaning place brain
anywhere say perception things can powerfully influence
reality coming you. - Yeah. - mean, great example, just harking back
testosterone. Okay, exercise boosts testosterone levels. exercise
success exercise failure? literature back 80s looking
outcomes marathons. testosterone rise people win
losers? Wrestling matches. Things sort simple prediction answer
wound being, didn't see simple answer. Okay, win marathon, not
necessarily predictor increased testosterone. about? find
like winner testosterone decreases, find guy came 73rd
massive testosterone increase. Whoa, about?
far human subtlety. guy won race decline testosterone
came three minutes later really, really expecting.
everybody now going writing hill. guy
came 73rd boost testosterone assuming dead


heart attack third mile, [Andrew laughs] instead managed finish.
interpretive stuff going there, prefrontal cortex about. -
Amazing, raises question cognitive flexibility, Can tell
something good us even not enjoying it? can wriggle around
corners choosing exercise the... Personally not big fan long bouts
meditation, benefited tremendously things like dedicated breathing
shorter rounds meditation. Can tell good wriggle around
corner get physiology working way want? cognitive
flexibility? Can third place runner tell myself, well, least came in,
wanted win badly. primary goal, another goal beat
previous time, that. so, [laughs] mean, it's... extent can
toggle relationship prefrontal cortex primitive
systems? - Well, enormous amount. example, low hierarchy
generally bad health like every mammal there, including us,
something special, can part multiple hierarchies time.
maybe low ranking one them, extremely high ranking
another, like crappiest job corporation, captain
softball team year company. better bet somebody
going find sorts ways decide nine five Monday Fridays, just stupid
paying bills. really matters prestige weekend. poorer,
deacon church here. can play sorts psychological
games that. One like consistent, reliable ones need
use frontal cortex like crazy is, somebody something rotten need
attribute it. answer is, something wrong, hmm, rotten.
Always always will constitutional explanation. something
rotten somebody, explain afterward? situational one. tired,
stressed sort setting, misunderstood this. best excusing
bad things access inner lives got
prefrontal cortexes great coming situational explanation rather than,
hey, maybe just like selfish rotten human, need change.
prefrontal cortex, every time, don't let somebody merge lane
front us, even though curse somebody thing and...
Endlessly. - love it. statement fact can select multiple
hierarchies participate in. seems like particularly important one nowadays


social media prevalent. know not particularly active social
media although might pleasantly, don't know unpleasantly surprised find
lot positive discussion work, don't even
need there. just continue discuss [laughs] work.
interesting social media found context very, broad. mean,
one argue one selects follow news articles reading,
etc. can create kind funneling information can dangerous.
verification crazy ideas even just less exposure new ideas. also
idea social media incredibly broad context. scroll feed,
no longer like eighth grade classroom office faculty
meeting. exposed thousands, not millions contexts, meal,
soccer game, person's body, person's intellect. YouTube another example.
vast, vast landscape. context completely mishmash whereas assuming
evolved. think evolve contexts much constrained.
interacted limited number individuals limited number different domains,
seasons tended constrain us all. course, got phones televisions,
started expand, now ever, brain, prefrontal cortex
sense exist multiple hierarchies essentially wicked
infinity. think might interacting primitive
systems aspects biology? - Well, think get is, ways
punchline of, human humans, use
exact blueprint, hormones, kinases, receptors,
same, everything built exact stuff species
there, go use completely novel way. usually terms
able abstract stuff space time dramatic ways. So, okay, low
ranking baboon can feel badly just like killed rabbit
eat higher ranking guy boots off takes away you,
feel crummy stressful unhappy. exact
things like brain bodies losing sense self-esteem,
can watching movie character screen feeling inadequate compared
like wonderful attractive are. can somebody driving past us
expensive car, don't even see face, can feel belittled
socioeconomic status. can watch like Lifestyles Rich Famous
read Bezos to. reason, decide life less fulfilling


didn't fly space 11 minutes. can feel miserable
ways no organism can, simply can
meaningful social networks include like party reading Facebook
weren't invited taking place Singapore, don't know
people, nonetheless, somehow means

01:11:20 Dr. Sapolsky Accomplishes Deep Thinking

feel less content turned be. take steps life
actively restrict contexts think live contemplate order
enhance creative life, intellectual life? steps actively take? -
Well, actively don't know make use anything [laughs] social media.
guess counts thus actively chosen not learn how.
case certainly last year half, like lots people, gone stretches
managed sort enforce moratorium looking news,
wonderfully freeing. think larger sense though, addition
neurobiologist, sort spent decades spending part year studying wild
baboons national park East Africa. spend three months year without
electricity, without phone calls, going 12 hours day without saying word
somebody. finally would, somebody nomadic pastoralist guy
different language. Yeah, 90% like insightful thinking anything
laboratory three months year, not one lab, not
inundated stuff. - Well, think shifting trend towards trying create
narrowing context that... like see, niece, 14-years-old
friends good putting phones away. say, not
going phones interaction, especially after... realized still
somewhat this. unclear headed,

01:13:17 Free Will?

2020 restrictive separated friends. Now it's,
really focus together not bring elements phones.
brings great hope generation, [laughs] maybe will...
knows, maybe run off study baboons, need field researchers.


along lines choice, like shift gears slightly talk freewill,
ability make choices all. - Well, personal way left field inflammatory
stance is, don't think shred freewill despite 95% philosophers.
think probably majority neuroscientists saying freewill least
circumstances. don't think all. reason is,
something, behave, make choice, whatever. understand
that, intention come from? Part due like sensory
environment previous minute. hormone levels
bloodstream morning. whether wonderful
stressful last three months sort neuroplasticity happened. Part
hormone levels exposed fetus. Part culture ancestors
came with, thus parented kid.
there, can understand behavior coming without incorporating
those. point, not relevant factors,
ultimately one factor. talking evolution
behavior, definition also talking genetics. talking
genes behavior, definition talking brain
constructed proteins coded for. talking like mood
disorder now, talking sense efficacy getting five-year-
old. intertwined. look influences, basically like
challenge is, show neuron just caused behavior, show network
neurons just caused behavior. show nothing just
influenced anything sensory environment one second ago
evolution species. no space fit freewill concept
winds brain, not brain. simply no wiggle room
there. - can appreciate behaviors choices consequences
long line dominoes fell prior behavior. possible can
intervene domino effect, speak. words, can recognition
fact genes heritability, epigenome that, hormonal context,
historical context. Can knowledge give small shard
freewill? Meaning, allow say, ah, okay, accept choices
somewhat predetermined, yet knowing gives additional layer
control? philosophical biological universe works? - Nah.
can produce wonderfully positive belief change can happen. Even


traumatic change, even worst circumstances, unlikely people, change
can happen, things can change. Don't fatalistic, don't decide
mechanistic, biological machines nothing can ever... Change can happen,
people go off rails translating into, can change ourselves. don't,
can't no freewill. However, can changed circumstance.
point is, like look Aplysia, sea slug learned retract gill
response shock tail, can like conditioning, Pavlovian conditioning
it, learned, behavior changed environment. hear
news something like horrifically depressing going on, refugees wherever.
result, feel little bit helpless less sense efficacy
world, behaviors changed. Okay, okay, yeah, guess that,
remarkable thing is, exact neurobiology. signal transduction
pathways happening sea snail incorporate exact kinases
proteases phosphatases mammalian fear
conditioning, alert, conserved. exact thing, simply
playing obviously much, much fancier domain. learned
change possible despite understanding mechanistically can't change
volitionally, understand change possible, just
changed ability brain respond optimistic stimuli. changed
ability brain now send direction exposed
information will seem cheerful rather depressing. Oh God, amazing,
Nelson Mandela Martin Luther king folks did. Wow,
adverse circumstances, able do. Maybe can also, maybe can go
read people like get even data points change
neurochemistry, responses different now. tilted little bit
direction feeling like can make difference instead damn
hopeless. enormous change can happen, last thing come
view of, nothing less sum biology interactions
environment,

01:20:50 Apply Knowledge & Learning

throw hands say, thus no use trying change anything. -
can acknowledge change extremely hard impossible, circumstances


can change, yet striving better human beings still worthwhile
endeavor. correct? - Absolutely. simply knowledge, either
experience making end right neurobiology class taught
change can happen within framework mechanistic neurobiology.
now open made optimistic good news world around you.
likely inspired that, resistant getting
discouraged bad news, simply now understand possible. - Mm-hmm,
yeah, somebody spent much career working hippocampus,
assume believer neuroplasticity, neural circuits can change
response experience, so-called top-down mechanisms
prefrontal cortex talking can play role there,
decision try change pursuit knowledge pursuit experience
can shape circuitry, therefore make us different machines, speak. - Yeah.
not can say prenatal hormone exposure changed way brain
constructed, learning prenatal hormone exposure can change construction
brain will change brain right now, think
intentions came from. Wow, maybe something it. knowledge
knowledge effector itself. - important powerful
statement hear. think many people think tool, doesn't involve pill
protocol, useless. certainly pills protocols
useful variety context variety things, idea knowledge itself,
whereas put it, knowledge knowledge tool, think important
concept people embed minds. And, listen, grateful discussion
raising topics. think people, many people know work
testosterone, stress, covered today, work freewill
idea hopeless total control. think realizing
listening neither true, solution resides

01:23:44 Robert’s New Book: “Determined: Science Life Without Free Will”

understanding freewill lack it, [laughs] also neuroplasticity.
working book freewill, willing tell us little bit
book process can look forward to? - Yeah,
going really slow. Title is, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill."


essentially first half book trying convince reader, okay, not
no freewill whatsoever, least lot less normally assumed.
going standard arguments freewill, doesn't make sense
21st century science? led reading lot frustrating
philosophers basically willing admit stuff made like atoms
molecules. like physical reality sort world, not just relying
magic, believe freewill magical reasons, doesn't make
sense. Okay, first half book hopefully convince people
much less freewill used think. second half gigantic
juncture built around fact haven't thought freewill since like
adolescent. despite thinking way, still absolutely no idea
supposed function belief. supposed go everyday life
anything feel entitled isn't true? angers hatreds feel aren't justified,
no thing appropriate, blame punishment praise reward,
none makes sense, somebody like even compliments haircut,
conditioned say, oh, thanks, something do.
supposed function that? second half wrestling that,
punchline is, going incredibly hard. think going
hard subtract notion freewill making sense like serial murderers,
going thousand times harder making sense somebody says "good job"
you. [Andrew laughs] exact reality sort
interpretations. going incredibly hard, nonetheless look
history subtracted notion agency sorts realms
blame, starting thinking witches caused hailstorms 500 years ago notion
psychodynamically screwed mothers cause schizophrenia, done it.
done endless number times, able subtract sense volition
understanding world works around us. don't murderers running
amuck street, society hasn't collapsed puddle, fact,
humane society. good news possible done repeatedly
past, going hard hell. hard hell try write
coherently, [laughs] discovering, going slowly. - Well, speak many, many
people say really excited book done will
patiently wait, great excitement book, "Determined". said title,
correct? - Yeah, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill". seems like


can't publish book days without sub-title, it? - Fantastic. Well,
excited read book. grateful conversation today, learned
ton. Every time speak learn, really pleasure delight
interact today previous years, say, colleagues.
thank again, Robert, everything hard, hard work
thinking put work clear put lot hard work

is, absolutely sure army get
country three days. hell, start World War I, get big surprise it.
Testosterone altering risk assessment beforehand probably played big role kind
miscalculation.

00:29:20 Dopamine Impacts Testosterone & Motivation

- Super-interesting. always think testosterone dopamine close cousins
brain, not just relationship pituitary
hypothalamus. That, course, also dopamine's salient role creating
bias towards exteroception. somebody takes drug, increases
dopamine, chockablock full dopamine. tend, want highlight 'tend'
is, really generalizing here, tend focus outward goals,
things beyond boundaries skin. testosterone seems bit
same, tends put us similar mode perceiving outside world ways
asking questions like, relate species? relate
goals? anything can better conceptualize relationship
testosterone dopamine motivation? just take us
alleyways of, neural pathways hypothalamus? fine too. - Well,
think got lots sort massive revisionism dopamine. Everyone,
since pharaohs got brought taught dopamine pleasure
reward. turns isn't, anticipation reward, generating
motivation, goal-directed behavior needed go get reward.
know it, using like elevated dopamine, entire life motivate
whatever going get like entry heaven after-life kind of, sort
thing. really motivation. testosterone even individuals
not aggressive testosterone replacement often helpful thing
aging males increases energy, increases sense thereness, presence
alertness increases motivation. whole aspect, takes us
motivation get like go, hand lots soup soup kitchen
homeless people, get go ethnically cleanse village. got much
makeup testosterone got onboard. activating
energetic sense, testosterone within minutes increases glucose uptake skeletal
muscle. just awake alert that, lot


dopamine does. one might predict then, getting just right levels
testosterone infused bloodstream feels great lab rats. will lever press
get infused range optimizes dopamine release. is,
absolutely right, deeply intertwined. - Yeah, beautiful biology there.

00:32:32 Estrogen: Improves Brain & Longevity TIMING KEY

love way encapsulate relationship. want ask estrogen,
don't hear estrogen often, always interesting now
public facing education, testosterone controversial molecule, just say
almost controversial. [laughs] [Robert laughs] estrogen doesn't seem hold
controversial weight, yet estrogen powerful effects
animal brain human brain males females. Men not want
estrogen go low. Terrible things happen, will lose cognitive function, libido
can drop. men need estrogen well, perhaps maybe can put filter
estrogen testosterone. general themes estrogen
people aware think generally misunderstood? really
feelings empathy making us sensitive? sense not. - No,
context dependent. estrogen giving birth playing central
role wanting shred face somebody getting close kittens kind
thing, know not just warm, fuzzy, empathic kind stuff. Estrogen lots
ways summarized by, got choice matter lot
estrogen bloodstream not, go lot estrogen. enhances
cognition, exactly said, stimulates neurogenesis hippocampus,
increases glucose oxygen delivery, protects dementia, decreases
inflammatory oxidative damage blood vessels, good protecting
cardiovascular disease contrast testosterone, making everyone
things worse. springs minefield question, is,
post-menopausal estrogen? sorts lab studies non-human primates
suggested keep estrogen levels high monkey's equivalent
menopause. going keep brain health lot better decreasing risk
dementia, stroke, every thing. Estrogen great antioxidant, that.
90s think Healy, forgetting name, first female
head NIH, Bernadine Healy set massive prospective human study,


going biggest one times, looking pluses minuses post-
menopausal estrogen. tens thousands women, was...
cut study short seeing was, estrogen not
normal bad stuff expect terms decalcification stuff,
increasing risk cardiovascular disease, increasing risk stroke,
increasing risk dementia. ground halt everybody,
stopped study front page news everybody panned point. nobody
make sense spending last 20 years studying exact
thing primates seeing protective effects. explanation turned
one things like law unexpected consequences. Okay,
menopause women, lasts different lengths time, may factor going
come. know what, not start giving study subjects estrogen
totally past menopause. got lag time between, shift
sorts estrogen receptor patterns, bad effects come from.
- Wow! - monkey studies involved just maintaining ovulatory levels
post-menopausal period. get great effects. Estrogen one
greatest predictors protection Alzheimer's disease, that, needs
physiological. Just keep continuing body long time
versus let whole thing shutdown suddenly like try fire coal stoves
bottom basement kind thing, get going, get utterly different
outcomes. caused lot human health consequences people suddenly
decided estrogen fact neurologically endangering post-menopausally. - Wow,
fascinating. never thought steroid hormone receptors not
binding estrogen, devoid estrogen binding, say, set off
opposite biochemical cascades. Fascinating. guess raises question
testosterone replacement too, whether not people [laughs] talk doctor
long. Men women talk physicians long avoid these,
whatever happening periods isn't sufficient testosterone and/or
estrogen. sounds like cause longer-term problems even therapies
introduced. - Two additional misery slash complications. So, okay, trying
understand, look women history without post-menopausal estrogen
replacement done great. seeing 20 years later, estrogen
predictor decreased risk Alzheimer's. got start trying
unpacking prospective type studies. much estrogen? times? Estrogen


catchall term bunch hormones, estrone, estradiol, estriol. much one
them? Natural synthetic? Go try figure out. second
complication is, often hard say anything estrogen outside
context progesterone doing. often not absolute levels either,
ratio two. complicated endocrine system
testosterone. generate dramatic cyclicity like no male
hypothalamus ever dream off. much, much complicated system, thus,
lot complicated understand,

00:39:40 Testosterone & Sperm Counts Males Really Dropping?

let alone like figure ideal benefits it. - Yeah. don't know
make literature dropping rates testosterone endocrine disruptors.
Berkeley Tyrone Hayes published data frogs drinking
water various locations throughout United States, not just California,
seeing severe endocrine disruption blockade or, androgen receptors
sorts issues. hear time now sperm counts
dropping, endocrine disruptors birth control
water, drinking water. starts sound little crazy, yet also
fooled by, guess good example be, lot crazy stuff
world online terrible stuff highly processed foods. yet got
respectable people, endocrinologists UCSF like Robert Lustig saying, yeah, lot
hidden sugars emulsifiers, causing real problems.
become open-minded question. so, suffering drops
sperm counts testosterone estrogen fertility consequence endocrine
disruptors environments food, social reasons? anything
can hang hat like real data confident in? just mess? -
No, phenomenon appear quite real. Cross-sectional studies, human
populations, still don't understand one first things Hayes
spotted. Decreasing testicle size crocodiles. [Andrew laughs] Go figure
one first contributions this. think phenomenon absolutely real.
left two classic challenges, correlated
something broad environmental toxins. ones, much, when, etc.?
one always being, well, okay, dropping dropping enough make difference.


big effect this? juries still out. - Yeah,
area know lot interest in, got groups people won't
touch receipt store BPAs inks the...
[laughs] got people don't care things. fascinating area.

00:42:15 Stress Mitigation & Sense Control

hope biology will done soon. like briefly return stress.
described study two rats, one running wheel voluntarily, one
basically stuck running wheel, forced run anytime, rat number one runs.
one case rat voluntarily exercising. [laughs] case, rat
forced go PE class, speak, really, seeing divergent effects
biology. like just touch use kind case study stress
mitigation general. rather obsessed colleague, David Spiegel, Associate
Chair Psychiatry Stanford obsessed question of, humans can start
mitigate stress? think stress mitigation
individuals families culture try encourage people
mitigate stress, ways not going turn us rat number two,
forced mitigate stress therefore becomes stressful.
[laughs] - see is, rat number one gets benefits exercise. Rat
number two gets downsides severe stress exact muscle
expenditure movements going on. Perfectly yoked, great example
interpretation head. haven't kept literature, bet you, rat
number two whole lot activity amygdala rat number one.
Okay, stress mitigation. Anything say preface with,
reasonably good telling people going happen don't manage
stress, terrible actually like managing stress advising manage that.
much better bad news aspect it. see is, now just classic
literature, half century old, sort showing building blocks stress. Not,
ooh, step outside gored elephant, can grow
experience? doesn't kill makes stronger.
stress response, realm gray zone ambiguous social
interactions, sort thing. people massive stress responses, others not
all, between, enjoy it. Like building blocks of, makes


psychological stress stressful? first one exactly brought
running study. sense control? sense control makes stressors less
stressful. running wheel shows studies you, lab rat
college freshman volunteer trained pressing lever, less likely
get shock. today lever working away unbeknownst
lever turned off, no effect shock frequency,
think control, less stress response. rat
day-in day-out, less likely get ulcer. sense
control. related sense predictability. Rat get shocked, human gets
shocked, whatever, scenario either shocks come now then,
shocks come now then, 10 seconds little warning light comes on.
get warning light, shocks distressful. got predictability
not getting warning lights, second half second away
next shock. get warning light, know isn't one, got
least 10 seconds worth relaxation. know coming, can prepare
coping responses, best afterward know finally safe,
can recover it. enormously protective. Others outlet frustration,
take rat getting shocked, run running wheel,
protective thing, voluntarily. got rat can gnaw bar
wood, stressor less stressful. Unfortunately, rat primate human
stressed, ability aggressively dump somebody smaller weaker
also reduces stress response. fact displacement aggression reduces
stress accounts huge percent triggers like unhappiness.
variables, get social support well. good one. Interpreting circumstances
good news rather bad. Hurray, got simple sort like take
home recipe go get much control much predictability many
outlets much social support possible, going just fine.
go that, recipe total disaster much, much
subtle that. one great example, okay, getting shocks, want
warning beforehand, get little warning light 10 seconds shock,
wonderfully protective. Get warning light one second shock doesn't
anything. not enough time get psychological benefits
anticipation. Now instead, gets little warning coming two minutes
shock, going make things worse not going sitting


like reveling sort sense predictability, soon going be, oh.
going sitting two minutes saying, damn, comes. Predictive
information works narrow domain. Similarly, control. want
sense control face stress? answer is, mild moderate
stressor happening then, sense control completely
independent reality whether control not, face mild
moderate stressors, sense control gets interpreted as, wow, look much worse
things been. Thank God, control, top master fate.
contrast, major stressor, arbitrary sense control make
think, oh God, look much better been. prevented it.
know intuitively like face people's worst stressors.
Nobody stopped car way kids suddenly jumped out. wouldn't
mattered gotten doctor month ago, instead now,
wouldn't made any... didn't actually control. see is,
absolutely want huge sense control mild moderate stressors,
especially ones result good outcome. Hooray, me, face horrible
stressors, want like self-deception, like truth beauty don't
necessarily go hand-in-hand point. stress management techniques
impact control predictability wind far worse neutral preaching
somebody homeless somebody terminal cancer, somebody
refugee. Tell neurotic middle-class person psychological tools
turn hell heaven. truth that. thing somebody
going real hell, just privileged heartlessness
doesn't work. outlets, outlets damaging,
not good way mitigate stress. Social support, confusing mere
acquaintances real social support, going rug pulled
point. mistaking social support being, going bitching
moaning demanding supportiveness everyone around rather
reciprocally, not going work well either. not simple.
not nothing lots us really lousy. It, like good friends things
like that, takes lot work right? wrong may
temporarily seem like great thing, turns completely misplaced
faith, going feeling worse started.



00:51:35 Best Buffer Stress

- Interesting. days, lot interest using physical practices mitigate
stress, trying get ruminating, extent take control neural
circuits brain using exercise using breathing hypnosis. And, course,
hypnosis mental component well. thoughts stress mitigation
standpoint of, okay, don't want rat number two, want select
something ourselves, take initiative ourselves. forced
exercising not, actually negative health effect perhaps. need
pick something like, need take control it. terms supporting
people, touched bit. best way support people?
talk stressful thing? mean, not asking play psychologist here,
find divergent data this. can spin lather ruminating
something. language seems like wonderful tool, also fairly
deprived tool doesn't really get core physiology like something
like breathing would. thoughts more, lack better way put
it, head-centered, cognitive approaches stress mitigation versus kind going
core physiology. Cold showers now even thing extent just get
people stress acclimated, voluntarily taking cold showers. - makes sense
physiologically, preconditioning real stressors come. terms
bring up, oh, transcendental meditation, mindfulness, exercise, prayer, sort reflecting
gratitude, sort thing. Collectively work average, work
terms of, can lower heart rate cholesterol levels sorts good
outcomes, compromise us. One exactly caveat comes
running wheel study is, doesn't matter many friends swear stress
management technique. makes want scream head off 10
seconds, not one going work you. read fine print
testimonials, got something works you. Another one stress
management type techniques work, can't save weekend, can't
save stuck hold phone Muzak two minutes.
got something stop virtually, daily every
day, spend 20, 30 minutes it. see coming
like 80/20 rule economics. 80/20, 80% complaints store come
20% customers, things like that. see is, entire life consists


every single thing shoulders, can't say no 24/7. stopped
finally said, wellbeing important enough finally get say no
stuff can't say no to. going every day 20 minutes,
whatever stress management technique 20 minutes sort
knows what, already 80% way simply decided
wellbeing important enough going stop every single day
priority. exactly finding find people chronic
depression untreated merely calling getting appointment see mental
health professional, people start feeling better already evidence
activated, matter enough this, conceive
actually good outcome rather hopeless one. Just something
meditative reflective every day so, hardly even matters one
doing. comes thus another warning, not trust anybody
says, scientifically proven brand stress management works
better ones. Just watch wallet point. - Yeah, amen. think one
core goals lab David Spiegel's lab, know worked
David published papers David well really try find
various entry points thing call autonomic nervous system
stress system, systems gone unchecked really can take us
dark path. idea many entry points really one keeps,
data keep telling us again. no magic breathing tool
exercise, variety one those. And, again, come back idea
one select one make space for, one
hopefully enjoy going work best terms physiology. - [mumbles]
benign people stuck around you.

00:57:04 Power Perception, Choice & Individual Differences

- Right, right, absolutely. brings question of, find amazing
perceive event, whether not chose event not can
incredible different effects circuitry brain circuitry body
biology cells. ways boggles mind, like can decision made
presumably prefrontal cortex, although parts brain well, can
change essentially polarity response body. And, mean, talked


Type personalities there. don't go detail
sake time, interesting effects endothelial cells. mean, literally
size of, [laughs] portals blood opposite direction, depending
whether not somebody wants situation highly motivated person. Maybe
just give us top contour think really illustrates
principle beautifully. maybe would, just speculate
brain might switch turn one experience terrible beneficial
beneficial terrible, really fascinating. - Well, need like tonight
going sleep lying bed nice drowsy
heart's beating nice slow, start thinking fact heart isn't going
beat forever. [Andrew laughs] imagine toes getting cold afterward
imagine flow blood coming halt clotting. going
something physiology point 99% mammals
running frantically. going turning sympathetic
stress response thought, emotions, memory. measure
just much cortex limbic system sends projections
autonomic regulators brain. can think autonomic regulatory neurons
action ways animals can like extremes environmental
circumstances. given autonomic rule, mean, big challenge
understanding gigantic individual differences. that's, talk
optimal amount stress, counts stimulation, general stress not
severe doesn't go long overall benevolence setting.
conditions, love stressed something unexpected
control predictability like really interesting plot turn movie watching.
great, get individual differences somehow accommodate
fact people, perfect stimulatory amount stress like getting
early Audubon birdwatching walk next Sunday morning. somebody else,
signing like mercenary Yemen. [Andrew laughs]

01:00:32 Context-Setting, Prefrontal Cortex & Hierarchy

tremendous individual differences swamp simple prescriptions. - Yeah,
prefrontal cortex, thinking machinery harbor, double-edged
sword. remarkable is, areas brain like hypothalamus


amygdala, sort like switches. mean, context gain
control. talked gain control testosterone, etc., really like
switches. mean, stimulate ventromedial hypothalamus, get right neurons,
animal will try kill even object sitting next it. tickle
neurons, it'll try mate object. mean, really wild. think
probably rules prefrontal cortex also, sounds like context plural
prefrontal cortex can draw probably infinite, probably learn
perceive threat anything. Whether not another group whether not
science whether not somebody's version shape earth versus
another. mean, like, can plug anything system give enough data,
think sounds like drive fear response love response.
overstepping? - [laughs] mixed horribly ambivalent one changing
millisecond, like mutually contradictory. No, absolutely case
prefrontal cortex, regretted like wasted 30 years
life studying hippocampus shoot studied prefrontal cortex
much interesting does, contextual stuff.
ways not okay lie setting, great thing another.
not okay kill unless them, get medal. not,
social context moral relativity situational ethic stuff, prefrontal cortex
got master that. winds meaning place brain
anywhere say perception things can powerfully influence
reality coming you. - Yeah. - mean, great example, just harking back
testosterone. Okay, exercise boosts testosterone levels. exercise
success exercise failure? literature back 80s looking
outcomes marathons. testosterone rise people win
losers? Wrestling matches. Things sort simple prediction answer
wound being, didn't see simple answer. Okay, win marathon, not
necessarily predictor increased testosterone. about? find
like winner testosterone decreases, find guy came 73rd
massive testosterone increase. Whoa, about?
far human subtlety. guy won race decline testosterone
came three minutes later really, really expecting.
everybody now going writing hill. guy
came 73rd boost testosterone assuming dead


heart attack third mile, [Andrew laughs] instead managed finish.
interpretive stuff going there, prefrontal cortex about. -
Amazing, raises question cognitive flexibility, Can tell
something good us even not enjoying it? can wriggle around
corners choosing exercise the... Personally not big fan long bouts
meditation, benefited tremendously things like dedicated breathing
shorter rounds meditation. Can tell good wriggle around
corner get physiology working way want? cognitive
flexibility? Can third place runner tell myself, well, least came in,
wanted win badly. primary goal, another goal beat
previous time, that. so, [laughs] mean, it's... extent can
toggle relationship prefrontal cortex primitive
systems? - Well, enormous amount. example, low hierarchy
generally bad health like every mammal there, including us,
something special, can part multiple hierarchies time.
maybe low ranking one them, extremely high ranking
another, like crappiest job corporation, captain
softball team year company. better bet somebody
going find sorts ways decide nine five Monday Fridays, just stupid
paying bills. really matters prestige weekend. poorer,
deacon church here. can play sorts psychological
games that. One like consistent, reliable ones need
use frontal cortex like crazy is, somebody something rotten need
attribute it. answer is, something wrong, hmm, rotten.
Always always will constitutional explanation. something
rotten somebody, explain afterward? situational one. tired,
stressed sort setting, misunderstood this. best excusing
bad things access inner lives got
prefrontal cortexes great coming situational explanation rather than,
hey, maybe just like selfish rotten human, need change.
prefrontal cortex, every time, don't let somebody merge lane
front us, even though curse somebody thing and...
Endlessly. - love it. statement fact can select multiple
hierarchies participate in. seems like particularly important one nowadays


social media prevalent. know not particularly active social
media although might pleasantly, don't know unpleasantly surprised find
lot positive discussion work, don't even
need there. just continue discuss [laughs] work.
interesting social media found context very, broad. mean,
one argue one selects follow news articles reading,
etc. can create kind funneling information can dangerous.
verification crazy ideas even just less exposure new ideas. also
idea social media incredibly broad context. scroll feed,
no longer like eighth grade classroom office faculty
meeting. exposed thousands, not millions contexts, meal,
soccer game, person's body, person's intellect. YouTube another example.
vast, vast landscape. context completely mishmash whereas assuming
evolved. think evolve contexts much constrained.
interacted limited number individuals limited number different domains,
seasons tended constrain us all. course, got phones televisions,
started expand, now ever, brain, prefrontal cortex
sense exist multiple hierarchies essentially wicked
infinity. think might interacting primitive
systems aspects biology? - Well, think get is, ways
punchline of, human humans, use
exact blueprint, hormones, kinases, receptors,
same, everything built exact stuff species
there, go use completely novel way. usually terms
able abstract stuff space time dramatic ways. So, okay, low
ranking baboon can feel badly just like killed rabbit
eat higher ranking guy boots off takes away you,
feel crummy stressful unhappy. exact
things like brain bodies losing sense self-esteem,
can watching movie character screen feeling inadequate compared
like wonderful attractive are. can somebody driving past us
expensive car, don't even see face, can feel belittled
socioeconomic status. can watch like Lifestyles Rich Famous
read Bezos to. reason, decide life less fulfilling


didn't fly space 11 minutes. can feel miserable
ways no organism can, simply can
meaningful social networks include like party reading Facebook
weren't invited taking place Singapore, don't know
people, nonetheless, somehow means

01:11:20 Dr. Sapolsky Accomplishes Deep Thinking

feel less content turned be. take steps life

Well, actively don't know make use anything [laughs] social media.
guess counts thus actively chosen not learn how.

hormone levels exposed fetus. Part culture ancestors
came with, thus parented kid.
there, can understand behavior coming without incorporating
those. point, not relevant factors,
ultimately one factor. talking evolution
behavior, definition also talking genetics. talking
genes behavior, definition talking brain
constructed proteins coded for. talking like mood
disorder now, talking sense efficacy getting five-year-
old. intertwined. look influences, basically like
challenge is, show neuron just caused behavior, show network
neurons just caused behavior. show nothing just
influenced anything sensory environment one second ago
evolution species. no space fit freewill concept
winds brain, not brain. simply no wiggle room
there. - can appreciate behaviors choices consequences
long line dominoes fell prior behavior. possible can
intervene domino effect, speak. words, can recognition
fact genes heritability, epigenome that, hormonal context,
historical context. Can knowledge give small shard
freewill? Meaning, allow say, ah, okay, accept choices
somewhat predetermined, yet knowing gives additional layer
control? philosophical biological universe works? - Nah.
can produce wonderfully positive belief change can happen. Even


traumatic change, even worst circumstances, unlikely people, change
can happen, things can change. Don't fatalistic, don't decide
mechanistic, biological machines nothing can ever... Change can happen,
people go off rails translating into, can change ourselves. don't,
can't no freewill. However, can changed circumstance.
point is, like look Aplysia, sea slug learned retract gill
response shock tail, can like conditioning, Pavlovian conditioning
it, learned, behavior changed environment. hear
news something like horrifically depressing going on, refugees wherever.
result, feel little bit helpless less sense efficacy
world, behaviors changed. Okay, okay, yeah, guess that,
remarkable thing is, exact neurobiology. signal transduction
pathways happening sea snail incorporate exact kinases
proteases phosphatases mammalian fear
conditioning, alert, conserved. exact thing, simply
playing obviously much, much fancier domain. learned
change possible despite understanding mechanistically can't change
volitionally, understand change possible, just
changed ability brain respond optimistic stimuli. changed
ability brain now send direction exposed
information will seem cheerful rather depressing. Oh God, amazing,
Nelson Mandela Martin Luther king folks did. Wow,
adverse circumstances, able do. Maybe can also, maybe can go
read people like get even data points change
neurochemistry, responses different now. tilted little bit
direction feeling like can make difference instead damn
hopeless. enormous change can happen, last thing come
view of, nothing less sum biology interactions
environment,

01:20:50 Apply Knowledge & Learning

throw hands say, thus no use trying change anything. -
can acknowledge change extremely hard impossible, circumstances


can change, yet striving better human beings still worthwhile
endeavor. correct? - Absolutely. simply knowledge, either
experience making end right neurobiology class taught
change can happen within framework mechanistic neurobiology.
now open made optimistic good news world around you.
likely inspired that, resistant getting
discouraged bad news, simply now understand possible. - Mm-hmm,
yeah, somebody spent much career working hippocampus,
assume believer neuroplasticity, neural circuits can change
response experience, so-called top-down mechanisms
prefrontal cortex talking can play role there,
decision try change pursuit knowledge pursuit experience
can shape circuitry, therefore make us different machines, speak. - Yeah.
not can say prenatal hormone exposure changed way brain
constructed, learning prenatal hormone exposure can change construction
brain will change brain right now, think
intentions came from. Wow, maybe something it. knowledge
knowledge effector itself. - important powerful
statement hear. think many people think tool, doesn't involve pill
protocol, useless. certainly pills protocols
useful variety context variety things, idea knowledge itself,
whereas put it, knowledge knowledge tool, think important
concept people embed minds. And, listen, grateful discussion
raising topics. think people, many people know work
testosterone, stress, covered today, work freewill
idea hopeless total control. think realizing
listening neither true, solution resides

01:23:44 Robert’s New Book: “Determined: Science Life Without Free Will”

understanding freewill lack it, [laughs] also neuroplasticity.
working book freewill, willing tell us little bit
book process can look forward to? - Yeah,
going really slow. Title is, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill."


essentially first half book trying convince reader, okay, not
no freewill whatsoever, least lot less normally assumed.
going standard arguments freewill, doesn't make sense
21st century science? led reading lot frustrating
philosophers basically willing admit stuff made like atoms
molecules. like physical reality sort world, not just relying
magic, believe freewill magical reasons, doesn't make
sense. Okay, first half book hopefully convince people
much less freewill used think. second half gigantic
juncture built around fact haven't thought freewill since like
adolescent. despite thinking way, still absolutely no idea
supposed function belief. supposed go everyday life
anything feel entitled isn't true? angers hatreds feel aren't justified,
no thing appropriate, blame punishment praise reward,
none makes sense, somebody like even compliments haircut,
conditioned say, oh, thanks, something do.
supposed function that? second half wrestling that,
punchline is, going incredibly hard. think going
hard subtract notion freewill making sense like serial murderers,
going thousand times harder making sense somebody says "good job"
you. [Andrew laughs] exact reality sort
interpretations. going incredibly hard, nonetheless look
history subtracted notion agency sorts realms
blame, starting thinking witches caused hailstorms 500 years ago notion
psychodynamically screwed mothers cause schizophrenia, done it.
done endless number times, able subtract sense volition
understanding world works around us. don't murderers running
amuck street, society hasn't collapsed puddle, fact,
humane society. good news possible done repeatedly
past, going hard hell. hard hell try write
coherently, [laughs] discovering, going slowly. - Well, speak many, many
people say really excited book done will
patiently wait, great excitement book, "Determined". said title,
correct? - Yeah, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill". seems like


can't publish book days without sub-title, it? - Fantastic. Well,
excited read book. grateful conversation today, learned
ton. Every time speak learn, really pleasure delight
interact today previous years, say, colleagues.
thank again, Robert, everything hard, hard work
thinking put work clear put lot hard work

dopamine does. one might predict then, getting just right levels
testosterone infused bloodstream feels great lab rats. will lever press
get infused range optimizes dopamine release. is,
absolutely right, deeply intertwined. - Yeah, beautiful biology there.

00:32:32 Estrogen: Improves Brain & Longevity TIMING KEY

love way encapsulate relationship. want ask estrogen,
don't hear estrogen often, always interesting now
public facing education, testosterone controversial molecule, just say
almost controversial. [laughs] [Robert laughs] estrogen doesn't seem hold
controversial weight, yet estrogen powerful effects
animal brain human brain males females. Men not want
estrogen go low. Terrible things happen, will lose cognitive function, libido
can drop. men need estrogen well, perhaps maybe can put filter
estrogen testosterone. general themes estrogen
people aware think generally misunderstood? really
feelings empathy making us sensitive? sense not. - No,
context dependent. estrogen giving birth playing central
role wanting shred face somebody getting close kittens kind
thing, know not just warm, fuzzy, empathic kind stuff. Estrogen lots
ways summarized by, got choice matter lot
estrogen bloodstream not, go lot estrogen. enhances
cognition, exactly said, stimulates neurogenesis hippocampus,
increases glucose oxygen delivery, protects dementia, decreases
inflammatory oxidative damage blood vessels, good protecting
cardiovascular disease contrast testosterone, making everyone
things worse. springs minefield question, is,
post-menopausal estrogen? sorts lab studies non-human primates
suggested keep estrogen levels high monkey's equivalent
menopause. going keep brain health lot better decreasing risk
dementia, stroke, every thing. Estrogen great antioxidant, that.
90s think Healy, forgetting name, first female
head NIH, Bernadine Healy set massive prospective human study,


going biggest one times, looking pluses minuses post-
menopausal estrogen. tens thousands women, was...
cut study short seeing was, estrogen not
normal bad stuff expect terms decalcification stuff,
increasing risk cardiovascular disease, increasing risk stroke,
increasing risk dementia. ground halt everybody,
stopped study front page news everybody panned point. nobody
make sense spending last 20 years studying exact
thing primates seeing protective effects. explanation turned
one things like law unexpected consequences. Okay,
menopause women, lasts different lengths time, may factor going
come. know what, not start giving study subjects estrogen
totally past menopause. got lag time between, shift
sorts estrogen receptor patterns, bad effects come from.
- Wow! - monkey studies involved just maintaining ovulatory levels
post-menopausal period. get great effects. Estrogen one
greatest predictors protection Alzheimer's disease, that, needs
physiological. Just keep continuing body long time
versus let whole thing shutdown suddenly like try fire coal stoves
bottom basement kind thing, get going, get utterly different
outcomes. caused lot human health consequences people suddenly
decided estrogen fact neurologically endangering post-menopausally. - Wow,
fascinating. never thought steroid hormone receptors not
binding estrogen, devoid estrogen binding, say, set off
opposite biochemical cascades. Fascinating. guess raises question
testosterone replacement too, whether not people [laughs] talk doctor
long. Men women talk physicians long avoid these,
whatever happening periods isn't sufficient testosterone and/or
estrogen. sounds like cause longer-term problems even therapies
introduced. - Two additional misery slash complications. So, okay, trying
understand, look women history without post-menopausal estrogen
replacement done great. seeing 20 years later, estrogen
predictor decreased risk Alzheimer's. got start trying
unpacking prospective type studies. much estrogen? times? Estrogen


catchall term bunch hormones, estrone, estradiol, estriol. much one
them? Natural synthetic? Go try figure out. second
complication is, often hard say anything estrogen outside
context progesterone doing. often not absolute levels either,
ratio two. complicated endocrine system
testosterone. generate dramatic cyclicity like no male
hypothalamus ever dream off. much, much complicated system, thus,
lot complicated understand,

00:39:40 Testosterone & Sperm Counts Males Really Dropping?

let alone like figure ideal benefits it. - Yeah. don't know
make literature dropping rates testosterone endocrine disruptors.
Berkeley Tyrone Hayes published data frogs drinking
water various locations throughout United States, not just California,
seeing severe endocrine disruption blockade or, androgen receptors
sorts issues. hear time now sperm counts
dropping, endocrine disruptors birth control
water, drinking water. starts sound little crazy, yet also
fooled by, guess good example be, lot crazy stuff
world online terrible stuff highly processed foods. yet got
respectable people, endocrinologists UCSF like Robert Lustig saying, yeah, lot
hidden sugars emulsifiers, causing real problems.
become open-minded question. so, suffering drops
sperm counts testosterone estrogen fertility consequence endocrine
disruptors environments food, social reasons? anything
can hang hat like real data confident in? just mess? -
No, phenomenon appear quite real. Cross-sectional studies, human
populations, still don't understand one first things Hayes
spotted. Decreasing testicle size crocodiles. [Andrew laughs] Go figure
one first contributions this. think phenomenon absolutely real.
left two classic challenges, correlated
something broad environmental toxins. ones, much, when, etc.?
one always being, well, okay, dropping dropping enough make difference.


big effect this? juries still out. - Yeah,
area know lot interest in, got groups people won't
touch receipt store BPAs inks the...
[laughs] got people don't care things. fascinating area.

00:42:15 Stress Mitigation & Sense Control

hope biology will done soon. like briefly return stress.
described study two rats, one running wheel voluntarily, one
basically stuck running wheel, forced run anytime, rat number one runs.
one case rat voluntarily exercising. [laughs] case, rat
forced go PE class, speak, really, seeing divergent effects
biology. like just touch use kind case study stress
mitigation general. rather obsessed colleague, David Spiegel, Associate
Chair Psychiatry Stanford obsessed question of, humans can start
mitigate stress? think stress mitigation
individuals families culture try encourage people
mitigate stress, ways not going turn us rat number two,
forced mitigate stress therefore becomes stressful.
[laughs] - see is, rat number one gets benefits exercise. Rat
number two gets downsides severe stress exact muscle
expenditure movements going on. Perfectly yoked, great example
interpretation head. haven't kept literature, bet you, rat
number two whole lot activity amygdala rat number one.
Okay, stress mitigation. Anything say preface with,
reasonably good telling people going happen don't manage
stress, terrible actually like managing stress advising manage that.
much better bad news aspect it. see is, now just classic
literature, half century old, sort showing building blocks stress. Not,
ooh, step outside gored elephant, can grow
experience? doesn't kill makes stronger.
stress response, realm gray zone ambiguous social
interactions, sort thing. people massive stress responses, others not
all, between, enjoy it. Like building blocks of, makes


psychological stress stressful? first one exactly brought
running study. sense control? sense control makes stressors less
stressful. running wheel shows studies you, lab rat
college freshman volunteer trained pressing lever, less likely
get shock. today lever working away unbeknownst
lever turned off, no effect shock frequency,
think control, less stress response. rat
day-in day-out, less likely get ulcer. sense
control. related sense predictability. Rat get shocked, human gets
shocked, whatever, scenario either shocks come now then,
shocks come now then, 10 seconds little warning light comes on.
get warning light, shocks distressful. got predictability
not getting warning lights, second half second away
next shock. get warning light, know isn't one, got
least 10 seconds worth relaxation. know coming, can prepare
coping responses, best afterward know finally safe,
can recover it. enormously protective. Others outlet frustration,
take rat getting shocked, run running wheel,
protective thing, voluntarily. got rat can gnaw bar
wood, stressor less stressful. Unfortunately, rat primate human
stressed, ability aggressively dump somebody smaller weaker
also reduces stress response. fact displacement aggression reduces
stress accounts huge percent triggers like unhappiness.
variables, get social support well. good one. Interpreting circumstances
good news rather bad. Hurray, got simple sort like take
home recipe go get much control much predictability many
outlets much social support possible, going just fine.
go that, recipe total disaster much, much
subtle that. one great example, okay, getting shocks, want
warning beforehand, get little warning light 10 seconds shock,
wonderfully protective. Get warning light one second shock doesn't
anything. not enough time get psychological benefits
anticipation. Now instead, gets little warning coming two minutes
shock, going make things worse not going sitting


like reveling sort sense predictability, soon going be, oh.
going sitting two minutes saying, damn, comes. Predictive
information works narrow domain. Similarly, control. want
sense control face stress? answer is, mild moderate
stressor happening then, sense control completely
independent reality whether control not, face mild
moderate stressors, sense control gets interpreted as, wow, look much worse
things been. Thank God, control, top master fate.
contrast, major stressor, arbitrary sense control make
think, oh God, look much better been. prevented it.
know intuitively like face people's worst stressors.
Nobody stopped car way kids suddenly jumped out. wouldn't
mattered gotten doctor month ago, instead now,
wouldn't made any... didn't actually control. see is,
absolutely want huge sense control mild moderate stressors,
especially ones result good outcome. Hooray, me, face horrible
stressors, want like self-deception, like truth beauty don't
necessarily go hand-in-hand point. stress management techniques
impact control predictability wind far worse neutral preaching
somebody homeless somebody terminal cancer, somebody
refugee. Tell neurotic middle-class person psychological tools
turn hell heaven. truth that. thing somebody
going real hell, just privileged heartlessness
doesn't work. outlets, outlets damaging,
not good way mitigate stress. Social support, confusing mere
acquaintances real social support, going rug pulled
point. mistaking social support being, going bitching
moaning demanding supportiveness everyone around rather
reciprocally, not going work well either. not simple.
not nothing lots us really lousy. It, like good friends things
like that, takes lot work right? wrong may
temporarily seem like great thing, turns completely misplaced
faith, going feeling worse started.



00:51:35 Best Buffer Stress

- Interesting. days, lot interest using physical practices mitigate
stress, trying get ruminating, extent take control neural
circuits brain using exercise using breathing hypnosis. And, course,
hypnosis mental component well. thoughts stress mitigation
standpoint of, okay, don't want rat number two, want select
something ourselves, take initiative ourselves. forced
exercising not, actually negative health effect perhaps. need
pick something like, need take control it. terms supporting
people, touched bit. best way support people?
talk stressful thing? mean, not asking play psychologist here,
find divergent data this. can spin lather ruminating
something. language seems like wonderful tool, also fairly
deprived tool doesn't really get core physiology like something
like breathing would. thoughts more, lack better way put
it, head-centered, cognitive approaches stress mitigation versus kind going
core physiology. Cold showers now even thing extent just get
people stress acclimated, voluntarily taking cold showers. - makes sense
physiologically, preconditioning real stressors come. terms
bring up, oh, transcendental meditation, mindfulness, exercise, prayer, sort reflecting
gratitude, sort thing. Collectively work average, work
terms of, can lower heart rate cholesterol levels sorts good
outcomes, compromise us. One exactly caveat comes
running wheel study is, doesn't matter many friends swear stress
management technique. makes want scream head off 10
seconds, not one going work you. read fine print
testimonials, got something works you. Another one stress
management type techniques work, can't save weekend, can't
save stuck hold phone Muzak two minutes.
got something stop virtually, daily every
day, spend 20, 30 minutes it. see coming
like 80/20 rule economics. 80/20, 80% complaints store come
20% customers, things like that. see is, entire life consists


every single thing shoulders, can't say no 24/7. stopped
finally said, wellbeing important enough finally get say no
stuff can't say no to. going every day 20 minutes,
whatever stress management technique 20 minutes sort
knows what, already 80% way simply decided
wellbeing important enough going stop every single day
priority. exactly finding find people chronic
depression untreated merely calling getting appointment see mental
health professional, people start feeling better already evidence
activated, matter enough this, conceive
actually good outcome rather hopeless one. Just something
meditative reflective every day so, hardly even matters one
doing. comes thus another warning, not trust anybody
says, scientifically proven brand stress management works
better ones. Just watch wallet point. - Yeah, amen. think one
core goals lab David Spiegel's lab, know worked
David published papers David well really try find
various entry points thing call autonomic nervous system
stress system, systems gone unchecked really can take us
dark path. idea many entry points really one keeps,
data keep telling us again. no magic breathing tool
exercise, variety one those. And, again, come back idea
one select one make space for, one
hopefully enjoy going work best terms physiology. - [mumbles]
benign people stuck around you.

00:57:04 Power Perception, Choice & Individual Differences

- Right, right, absolutely. brings question of, find amazing
perceive event, whether not chose event not can
incredible different effects circuitry brain circuitry body
biology cells. ways boggles mind, like can decision made
presumably prefrontal cortex, although parts brain well, can
change essentially polarity response body. And, mean, talked


Type personalities there. don't go detail
sake time, interesting effects endothelial cells. mean, literally
size of, [laughs] portals blood opposite direction, depending
whether not somebody wants situation highly motivated person. Maybe
just give us top contour think really illustrates
principle beautifully. maybe would, just speculate
brain might switch turn one experience terrible beneficial
beneficial terrible, really fascinating. - Well, need like tonight
going sleep lying bed nice drowsy
heart's beating nice slow, start thinking fact heart isn't going
beat forever. [Andrew laughs] imagine toes getting cold afterward
imagine flow blood coming halt clotting. going
something physiology point 99% mammals
running frantically. going turning sympathetic
stress response thought, emotions, memory. measure
just much cortex limbic system sends projections
autonomic regulators brain. can think autonomic regulatory neurons
action ways animals can like extremes environmental
circumstances. given autonomic rule, mean, big challenge
understanding gigantic individual differences. that's, talk
optimal amount stress, counts stimulation, general stress not
severe doesn't go long overall benevolence setting.
conditions, love stressed something unexpected
control predictability like really interesting plot turn movie watching.
great, get individual differences somehow accommodate
fact people, perfect stimulatory amount stress like getting
early Audubon birdwatching walk next Sunday morning. somebody else,
signing like mercenary Yemen. [Andrew laughs]

01:00:32 Context-Setting, Prefrontal Cortex & Hierarchy

tremendous individual differences swamp simple prescriptions. - Yeah,
prefrontal cortex, thinking machinery harbor, double-edged
sword. remarkable is, areas brain like hypothalamus


amygdala, sort like switches. mean, context gain
control. talked gain control testosterone, etc., really like
switches. mean, stimulate ventromedial hypothalamus, get right neurons,
animal will try kill even object sitting next it. tickle
neurons, it'll try mate object. mean, really wild. think
probably rules prefrontal cortex also, sounds like context plural
prefrontal cortex can draw probably infinite, probably learn
perceive threat anything. Whether not another group whether not
science whether not somebody's version shape earth versus
another. mean, like, can plug anything system give enough data,
think sounds like drive fear response love response.
overstepping? - [laughs] mixed horribly ambivalent one changing
millisecond, like mutually contradictory. No, absolutely case
prefrontal cortex, regretted like wasted 30 years
life studying hippocampus shoot studied prefrontal cortex
much interesting does, contextual stuff.
ways not okay lie setting, great thing another.
not okay kill unless them, get medal. not,
social context moral relativity situational ethic stuff, prefrontal cortex
got master that. winds meaning place brain
anywhere say perception things can powerfully influence
reality coming you. - Yeah. - mean, great example, just harking back
testosterone. Okay, exercise boosts testosterone levels. exercise
success exercise failure? literature back 80s looking
outcomes marathons. testosterone rise people win
losers? Wrestling matches. Things sort simple prediction answer
wound being, didn't see simple answer. Okay, win marathon, not
necessarily predictor increased testosterone. about? find
like winner testosterone decreases, find guy came 73rd
massive testosterone increase. Whoa, about?
far human subtlety. guy won race decline testosterone
came three minutes later really, really expecting.
everybody now going writing hill. guy
came 73rd boost testosterone assuming dead


heart attack third mile, [Andrew laughs] instead managed finish.
interpretive stuff going there, prefrontal cortex about. -
Amazing, raises question cognitive flexibility, Can tell
something good us even not enjoying it? can wriggle around
corners choosing exercise the... Personally not big fan long bouts
meditation, benefited tremendously things like dedicated breathing
shorter rounds meditation. Can tell good wriggle around
corner get physiology working way want? cognitive
flexibility? Can third place runner tell myself, well, least came in,
wanted win badly. primary goal, another goal beat
previous time, that. so, [laughs] mean, it's... extent can
toggle relationship prefrontal cortex primitive
systems? - Well, enormous amount. example, low hierarchy
generally bad health like every mammal there, including us,
something special, can part multiple hierarchies time.
maybe low ranking one them, extremely high ranking
another, like crappiest job corporation, captain
softball team year company. better bet somebody
going find sorts ways decide nine five Monday Fridays, just stupid
paying bills. really matters prestige weekend. poorer,
deacon church here. can play sorts psychological
games that. One like consistent, reliable ones need
use frontal cortex like crazy is, somebody something rotten need
attribute it. answer is, something wrong, hmm, rotten.
Always always will constitutional explanation. something
rotten somebody, explain afterward? situational one. tired,
stressed sort setting, misunderstood this. best excusing
bad things access inner lives got
prefrontal cortexes great coming situational explanation rather than,
hey, maybe just like selfish rotten human, need change.
prefrontal cortex, every time, don't let somebody merge lane
front us, even though curse somebody thing and...
Endlessly. - love it. statement fact can select multiple
hierarchies participate in. seems like particularly important one nowadays


social media prevalent. know not particularly active social
media although might pleasantly, don't know unpleasantly surprised find
lot positive discussion work, don't even
need there. just continue discuss [laughs] work.
interesting social media found context very, broad. mean,
one argue one selects follow news articles reading,
etc. can create kind funneling information can dangerous.
verification crazy ideas even just less exposure new ideas. also
idea social media incredibly broad context. scroll feed,
no longer like eighth grade classroom office faculty
meeting. exposed thousands, not millions contexts, meal,
soccer game, person's body, person's intellect. YouTube another example.
vast, vast landscape. context completely mishmash whereas assuming
evolved. think evolve contexts much constrained.
interacted limited number individuals limited number different domains,
seasons tended constrain us all. course, got phones televisions,
started expand, now ever, brain, prefrontal cortex
sense exist multiple hierarchies essentially wicked
infinity. think might interacting primitive
systems aspects biology? - Well, think get is, ways
punchline of, human humans, use
exact blueprint, hormones, kinases, receptors,
same, everything built exact stuff species
there, go use completely novel way. usually terms
able abstract stuff space time dramatic ways. So, okay, low
ranking baboon can feel badly just like killed rabbit
eat higher ranking guy boots off takes away you,
feel crummy stressful unhappy. exact
things like brain bodies losing sense self-esteem,
can watching movie character screen feeling inadequate compared
like wonderful attractive are. can somebody driving past us
expensive car, don't even see face, can feel belittled
socioeconomic status. can watch like Lifestyles Rich Famous
read Bezos to. reason, decide life less fulfilling


didn't fly space 11 minutes. can feel miserable
ways no organism can, simply can
meaningful social networks include like party reading Facebook
weren't invited taking place Singapore, don't know
people, nonetheless, somehow means

01:11:20 Dr. Sapolsky Accomplishes Deep Thinking

feel less content turned be. take steps life
actively restrict contexts think live contemplate order
enhance creative life, intellectual life? steps actively take? -
Well, actively don't know make use anything [laughs] social media.
guess counts thus actively chosen not learn how.
case certainly last year half, like lots people, gone stretches
managed sort enforce moratorium looking news,
wonderfully freeing. think larger sense though, addition
neurobiologist, sort spent decades spending part year studying wild
baboons national park East Africa. spend three months year without
electricity, without phone calls, going 12 hours day without saying word
somebody. finally would, somebody nomadic pastoralist guy
different language. Yeah, 90% like insightful thinking anything
laboratory three months year, not one lab, not
inundated stuff. - Well, think shifting trend towards trying create
narrowing context that... like see, niece, 14-years-old
friends good putting phones away. say, not
going phones interaction, especially after... realized still
somewhat this. unclear headed,

01:13:17 Free Will?

2020 restrictive separated friends. Now it's,
really focus together not bring elements phones.
brings great hope generation, [laughs] maybe will...
knows, maybe run off study baboons, need field researchers.


along lines choice, like shift gears slightly talk freewill,
ability make choices all. - Well, personal way left field inflammatory
stance is, don't think shred freewill despite 95% philosophers.
think probably majority neuroscientists saying freewill least
circumstances. don't think all. reason is,
something, behave, make choice, whatever. understand
that, intention come from? Part due like sensory
environment previous minute. hormone levels
bloodstream morning. whether wonderful
stressful last three months sort neuroplasticity happened. Part
hormone levels exposed fetus. Part culture ancestors
came with, thus parented kid.
there, can understand behavior coming without incorporating
those. point, not relevant factors,
ultimately one factor. talking evolution
behavior, definition also talking genetics. talking
genes behavior, definition talking brain
constructed proteins coded for. talking like mood
disorder now, talking sense efficacy getting five-year-
old. intertwined. look influences, basically like
challenge is, show neuron just caused behavior, show network
neurons just caused behavior. show nothing just
influenced anything sensory environment one second ago
evolution species. no space fit freewill concept
winds brain, not brain. simply no wiggle room
there. - can appreciate behaviors choices consequences
long line dominoes fell prior behavior. possible can
intervene domino effect, speak. words, can recognition
fact genes heritability, epigenome that, hormonal context,
historical context. Can knowledge give small shard
freewill? Meaning, allow say, ah, okay, accept choices
somewhat predetermined, yet knowing gives additional layer
control? philosophical biological universe works? - Nah.
can produce wonderfully positive belief change can happen. Even


traumatic change, even worst circumstances, unlikely people, change
can happen, things can change. Don't fatalistic, don't decide
mechanistic, biological machines nothing can ever... Change can happen,
people go off rails translating into, can change ourselves. don't,
can't no freewill. However, can changed circumstance.
point is, like look Aplysia, sea slug learned retract gill
response shock tail, can like conditioning, Pavlovian conditioning
it, learned, behavior changed environment. hear
news something like horrifically depressing going on, refugees wherever.
result, feel little bit helpless less sense efficacy
world, behaviors changed. Okay, okay, yeah, guess that,
remarkable thing is, exact neurobiology. signal transduction
pathways happening sea snail incorporate exact kinases
proteases phosphatases mammalian fear
conditioning, alert, conserved. exact thing, simply
playing obviously much, much fancier domain. learned
change possible despite understanding mechanistically can't change
volitionally, understand change possible, just
changed ability brain respond optimistic stimuli. changed
ability brain now send direction exposed
information will seem cheerful rather depressing. Oh God, amazing,
Nelson Mandela Martin Luther king folks did. Wow,
adverse circumstances, able do. Maybe can also, maybe can go
read people like get even data points change
neurochemistry, responses different now. tilted little bit
direction feeling like can make difference instead damn
hopeless. enormous change can happen, last thing come
view of, nothing less sum biology interactions
environment,

01:20:50 Apply Knowledge & Learning

throw hands say, thus no use trying change anything. -
can acknowledge change extremely hard impossible, circumstances


can change, yet striving better human beings still worthwhile
endeavor. correct? - Absolutely. simply knowledge, either
experience making end right neurobiology class taught
change can happen within framework mechanistic neurobiology.
now open made optimistic good news world around you.
likely inspired that, resistant getting
discouraged bad news, simply now understand possible. - Mm-hmm,
yeah, somebody spent much career working hippocampus,
assume believer neuroplasticity, neural circuits can change
response experience, so-called top-down mechanisms
prefrontal cortex talking can play role there,
decision try change pursuit knowledge pursuit experience
can shape circuitry, therefore make us different machines, speak. - Yeah.
not can say prenatal hormone exposure changed way brain
constructed, learning prenatal hormone exposure can change construction
brain will change brain right now, think
intentions came from. Wow, maybe something it. knowledge
knowledge effector itself. - important powerful
statement hear. think many people think tool, doesn't involve pill
protocol, useless. certainly pills protocols
useful variety context variety things, idea knowledge itself,
whereas put it, knowledge knowledge tool, think important
concept people embed minds. And, listen, grateful discussion
raising topics. think people, many people know work
testosterone, stress, covered today, work freewill
idea hopeless total control. think realizing
listening neither true, solution resides

01:23:44 Robert’s New Book: “Determined: Science Life Without Free Will”

understanding freewill lack it, [laughs] also neuroplasticity.
working book freewill, willing tell us little bit
book process can look forward to? - Yeah,
going really slow. Title is, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill."


essentially first half book trying convince reader, okay, not
no freewill whatsoever, least lot less normally assumed.
going standard arguments freewill, doesn't make sense
21st century science? led reading lot frustrating
philosophers basically willing admit stuff made like atoms
molecules. like physical reality sort world, not just relying
magic, believe freewill magical reasons, doesn't make
sense. Okay, first half book hopefully convince people
much less freewill used think. second half gigantic
juncture built around fact haven't thought freewill since like
adolescent. despite thinking way, still absolutely no idea
supposed function belief. supposed go everyday life
anything feel entitled isn't true? angers hatreds feel aren't justified,
no thing appropriate, blame punishment praise reward,
none makes sense, somebody like even compliments haircut,
conditioned say, oh, thanks, something do.
supposed function that? second half wrestling that,
punchline is, going incredibly hard. think going
hard subtract notion freewill making sense like serial murderers,
going thousand times harder making sense somebody says "good job"
you. [Andrew laughs] exact reality sort
interpretations. going incredibly hard, nonetheless look
history subtracted notion agency sorts realms
blame, starting thinking witches caused hailstorms 500 years ago notion
psychodynamically screwed mothers cause schizophrenia, done it.
done endless number times, able subtract sense volition
understanding world works around us. don't murderers running
amuck street, society hasn't collapsed puddle, fact,
humane society. good news possible done repeatedly
past, going hard hell. hard hell try write
coherently, [laughs] discovering, going slowly. - Well, speak many, many
people say really excited book done will
patiently wait, great excitement book, "Determined". said title,
correct? - Yeah, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill". seems like


can't publish book days without sub-title, it? - Fantastic. Well,
excited read book. grateful conversation today, learned
ton. Every time speak learn, really pleasure delight
interact today previous years, say, colleagues.
thank again, Robert, everything hard, hard work
thinking put work clear put lot hard work

going biggest one times, looking pluses minuses post-
menopausal estrogen. tens thousands women, was...
cut study short seeing was, estrogen not
normal bad stuff expect terms decalcification stuff,
increasing risk cardiovascular disease, increasing risk stroke,
increasing risk dementia. ground halt everybody,
stopped study front page news everybody panned point. nobody
make sense spending last 20 years studying exact
thing primates seeing protective effects. explanation turned
one things like law unexpected consequences. Okay,
menopause women, lasts different lengths time, may factor going
come. know what, not start giving study subjects estrogen
totally past menopause. got lag time between, shift
sorts estrogen receptor patterns, bad effects come from.
- Wow! - monkey studies involved just maintaining ovulatory levels
post-menopausal period. get great effects. Estrogen one
greatest predictors protection Alzheimer's disease, that, needs
physiological. Just keep continuing body long time
versus let whole thing shutdown suddenly like try fire coal stoves
bottom basement kind thing, get going, get utterly different
outcomes. caused lot human health consequences people suddenly
decided estrogen fact neurologically endangering post-menopausally. - Wow,
fascinating. never thought steroid hormone receptors not
binding estrogen, devoid estrogen binding, say, set off
opposite biochemical cascades. Fascinating. guess raises question
testosterone replacement too, whether not people [laughs] talk doctor
long. Men women talk physicians long avoid these,
whatever happening periods isn't sufficient testosterone and/or
estrogen. sounds like cause longer-term problems even therapies
introduced. - Two additional misery slash complications. So, okay, trying
understand, look women history without post-menopausal estrogen
replacement done great. seeing 20 years later, estrogen
predictor decreased risk Alzheimer's. got start trying
unpacking prospective type studies. much estrogen? times? Estrogen


catchall term bunch hormones, estrone, estradiol, estriol. much one
them? Natural synthetic? Go try figure out. second
complication is, often hard say anything estrogen outside
context progesterone doing. often not absolute levels either,
ratio two. complicated endocrine system
testosterone. generate dramatic cyclicity like no male
hypothalamus ever dream off. much, much complicated system, thus,
lot complicated understand,

00:39:40 Testosterone & Sperm Counts Males Really Dropping?

let alone like figure ideal benefits it. - Yeah. don't know
make literature dropping rates testosterone endocrine disruptors.
Berkeley Tyrone Hayes published data frogs drinking
water various locations throughout United States, not just California,
seeing severe endocrine disruption blockade or, androgen receptors
sorts issues. hear time now sperm counts
dropping, endocrine disruptors birth control
water, drinking water. starts sound little crazy, yet also
fooled by, guess good example be, lot crazy stuff
world online terrible stuff highly processed foods. yet got
respectable people, endocrinologists UCSF like Robert Lustig saying, yeah, lot
hidden sugars emulsifiers, causing real problems.
become open-minded question. so, suffering drops
sperm counts testosterone estrogen fertility consequence endocrine
disruptors environments food, social reasons? anything
can hang hat like real data confident in? just mess? -
No, phenomenon appear quite real. Cross-sectional studies, human
populations, still don't understand one first things Hayes
spotted. Decreasing testicle size crocodiles. [Andrew laughs] Go figure
one first contributions this. think phenomenon absolutely real.
left two classic challenges, correlated
something broad environmental toxins. ones, much, when, etc.?
one always being, well, okay, dropping dropping enough make difference.


big effect this? juries still out. - Yeah,
area know lot interest in, got groups people won't
touch receipt store BPAs inks the...
[laughs] got people don't care things. fascinating area.

00:42:15 Stress Mitigation & Sense Control

hope biology will done soon. like briefly return stress.
described study two rats, one running wheel voluntarily, one
basically stuck running wheel, forced run anytime, rat number one runs.
one case rat voluntarily exercising. [laughs] case, rat
forced go PE class, speak, really, seeing divergent effects
biology. like just touch use kind case study stress
mitigation general. rather obsessed colleague, David Spiegel, Associate
Chair Psychiatry Stanford obsessed question of, humans can start
mitigate stress? think stress mitigation
individuals families culture try encourage people
mitigate stress, ways not going turn us rat number two,
forced mitigate stress therefore becomes stressful.
[laughs] - see is, rat number one gets benefits exercise. Rat
number two gets downsides severe stress exact muscle
expenditure movements going on. Perfectly yoked, great example
interpretation head. haven't kept literature, bet you, rat
number two whole lot activity amygdala rat number one.
Okay, stress mitigation. Anything say preface with,
reasonably good telling people going happen don't manage
stress, terrible actually like managing stress advising manage that.
much better bad news aspect it. see is, now just classic
literature, half century old, sort showing building blocks stress. Not,
ooh, step outside gored elephant, can grow
experience? doesn't kill makes stronger.
stress response, realm gray zone ambiguous social
interactions, sort thing. people massive stress responses, others not
all, between, enjoy it. Like building blocks of, makes


psychological stress stressful? first one exactly brought
running study. sense control? sense control makes stressors less
stressful. running wheel shows studies you, lab rat
college freshman volunteer trained pressing lever, less likely
get shock. today lever working away unbeknownst
lever turned off, no effect shock frequency,
think control, less stress response. rat
day-in day-out, less likely get ulcer. sense
control. related sense predictability. Rat get shocked, human gets
shocked, whatever, scenario either shocks come now then,
shocks come now then, 10 seconds little warning light comes on.
get warning light, shocks distressful. got predictability
not getting warning lights, second half second away
next shock. get warning light, know isn't one, got
least 10 seconds worth relaxation. know coming, can prepare
coping responses, best afterward know finally safe,
can recover it. enormously protective. Others outlet frustration,
take rat getting shocked, run running wheel,
protective thing, voluntarily. got rat can gnaw bar
wood, stressor less stressful. Unfortunately, rat primate human
stressed, ability aggressively dump somebody smaller weaker
also reduces stress response. fact displacement aggression reduces
stress accounts huge percent triggers like unhappiness.
variables, get social support well. good one. Interpreting circumstances
good news rather bad. Hurray, got simple sort like take
home recipe go get much control much predictability many
outlets much social support possible, going just fine.
go that, recipe total disaster much, much
subtle that. one great example, okay, getting shocks, want
warning beforehand, get little warning light 10 seconds shock,
wonderfully protective. Get warning light one second shock doesn't
anything. not enough time get psychological benefits
anticipation. Now instead, gets little warning coming two minutes
shock, going make things worse not going sitting


like reveling sort sense predictability, soon going be, oh.
going sitting two minutes saying, damn, comes. Predictive
information works narrow domain. Similarly, control. want
sense control face stress? answer is, mild moderate
stressor happening then, sense control completely
independent reality whether control not, face mild
moderate stressors, sense control gets interpreted as, wow, look much worse
things been. Thank God, control, top master fate.
contrast, major stressor, arbitrary sense control make
think, oh God, look much better been. prevented it.
know intuitively like face people's worst stressors.
Nobody stopped car way kids suddenly jumped out. wouldn't
mattered gotten doctor month ago, instead now,
wouldn't made any... didn't actually control. see is,
absolutely want huge sense control mild moderate stressors,
especially ones result good outcome. Hooray, me, face horrible
stressors, want like self-deception, like truth beauty don't
necessarily go hand-in-hand point. stress management techniques
impact control predictability wind far worse neutral preaching
somebody homeless somebody terminal cancer, somebody
refugee. Tell neurotic middle-class person psychological tools
turn hell heaven. truth that. thing somebody
going real hell, just privileged heartlessness
doesn't work. outlets, outlets damaging,
not good way mitigate stress. Social support, confusing mere
acquaintances real social support, going rug pulled
point. mistaking social support being, going bitching
moaning demanding supportiveness everyone around rather
reciprocally, not going work well either. not simple.
not nothing lots us really lousy. It, like good friends things
like that, takes lot work right? wrong may
temporarily seem like great thing, turns completely misplaced
faith, going feeling worse started.



00:51:35 Best Buffer Stress

- Interesting. days, lot interest using physical practices mitigate
stress, trying get ruminating, extent take control neural
circuits brain using exercise using breathing hypnosis. And, course,
hypnosis mental component well. thoughts stress mitigation
standpoint of, okay, don't want rat number two, want select
something ourselves, take initiative ourselves. forced
exercising not, actually negative health effect perhaps. need
pick something like, need take control it. terms supporting
people, touched bit. best way support people?
talk stressful thing? mean, not asking play psychologist here,
find divergent data this. can spin lather ruminating
something. language seems like wonderful tool, also fairly
deprived tool doesn't really get core physiology like something
like breathing would. thoughts more, lack better way put
it, head-centered, cognitive approaches stress mitigation versus kind going
core physiology. Cold showers now even thing extent just get
people stress acclimated, voluntarily taking cold showers. - makes sense
physiologically, preconditioning real stressors come. terms
bring up, oh, transcendental meditation, mindfulness, exercise, prayer, sort reflecting
gratitude, sort thing. Collectively work average, work
terms of, can lower heart rate cholesterol levels sorts good
outcomes, compromise us. One exactly caveat comes
running wheel study is, doesn't matter many friends swear stress
management technique. makes want scream head off 10
seconds, not one going work you. read fine print
testimonials, got something works you. Another one stress
management type techniques work, can't save weekend, can't
save stuck hold phone Muzak two minutes.
got something stop virtually, daily every
day, spend 20, 30 minutes it. see coming
like 80/20 rule economics. 80/20, 80% complaints store come
20% customers, things like that. see is, entire life consists


every single thing shoulders, can't say no 24/7. stopped
finally said, wellbeing important enough finally get say no
stuff can't say no to. going every day 20 minutes,
whatever stress management technique 20 minutes sort
knows what, already 80% way simply decided
wellbeing important enough going stop every single day
priority. exactly finding find people chronic
depression untreated merely calling getting appointment see mental
health professional, people start feeling better already evidence
activated, matter enough this, conceive
actually good outcome rather hopeless one. Just something
meditative reflective every day so, hardly even matters one
doing. comes thus another warning, not trust anybody
says, scientifically proven brand stress management works
better ones. Just watch wallet point. - Yeah, amen. think one
core goals lab David Spiegel's lab, know worked
David published papers David well really try find
various entry points thing call autonomic nervous system
stress system, systems gone unchecked really can take us
dark path. idea many entry points really one keeps,
data keep telling us again. no magic breathing tool
exercise, variety one those. And, again, come back idea
one select one make space for, one
hopefully enjoy going work best terms physiology. - [mumbles]
benign people stuck around you.

00:57:04 Power Perception, Choice & Individual Differences

- Right, right, absolutely. brings question of, find amazing
perceive event, whether not chose event not can
incredible different effects circuitry brain circuitry body
biology cells. ways boggles mind, like can decision made
presumably prefrontal cortex, although parts brain well, can
change essentially polarity response body. And, mean, talked


Type personalities there. don't go detail
sake time, interesting effects endothelial cells. mean, literally
size of, [laughs] portals blood opposite direction, depending
whether not somebody wants situation highly motivated person. Maybe
just give us top contour think really illustrates
principle beautifully. maybe would, just speculate
brain might switch turn one experience terrible beneficial
beneficial terrible, really fascinating. - Well, need like tonight
going sleep lying bed nice drowsy
heart's beating nice slow, start thinking fact heart isn't going
beat forever. [Andrew laughs] imagine toes getting cold afterward
imagine flow blood coming halt clotting. going
something physiology point 99% mammals
running frantically. going turning sympathetic
stress response thought, emotions, memory. measure
just much cortex limbic system sends projections
autonomic regulators brain. can think autonomic regulatory neurons
action ways animals can like extremes environmental
circumstances. given autonomic rule, mean, big challenge
understanding gigantic individual differences. that's, talk
optimal amount stress, counts stimulation, general stress not
severe doesn't go long overall benevolence setting.
conditions, love stressed something unexpected
control predictability like really interesting plot turn movie watching.
great, get individual differences somehow accommodate
fact people, perfect stimulatory amount stress like getting
early Audubon birdwatching walk next Sunday morning. somebody else,
signing like mercenary Yemen. [Andrew laughs]

01:00:32 Context-Setting, Prefrontal Cortex & Hierarchy

tremendous individual differences swamp simple prescriptions. - Yeah,
prefrontal cortex, thinking machinery harbor, double-edged
sword. remarkable is, areas brain like hypothalamus


amygdala, sort like switches. mean, context gain
control. talked gain control testosterone, etc., really like
switches. mean, stimulate ventromedial hypothalamus, get right neurons,
animal will try kill even object sitting next it. tickle
neurons, it'll try mate object. mean, really wild. think
probably rules prefrontal cortex also, sounds like context plural
prefrontal cortex can draw probably infinite, probably learn
perceive threat anything. Whether not another group whether not
science whether not somebody's version shape earth versus
another. mean, like, can plug anything system give enough data,
think sounds like drive fear response love response.
overstepping? - [laughs] mixed horribly ambivalent one changing
millisecond, like mutually contradictory. No, absolutely case
prefrontal cortex, regretted like wasted 30 years
life studying hippocampus shoot studied prefrontal cortex
much interesting does, contextual stuff.
ways not okay lie setting, great thing another.
not okay kill unless them, get medal. not,
social context moral relativity situational ethic stuff, prefrontal cortex
got master that. winds meaning place brain
anywhere say perception things can powerfully influence
reality coming you. - Yeah. - mean, great example, just harking back
testosterone. Okay, exercise boosts testosterone levels. exercise
success exercise failure? literature back 80s looking
outcomes marathons. testosterone rise people win
losers? Wrestling matches. Things sort simple prediction answer
wound being, didn't see simple answer. Okay, win marathon, not
necessarily predictor increased testosterone. about? find
like winner testosterone decreases, find guy came 73rd
massive testosterone increase. Whoa, about?
far human subtlety. guy won race decline testosterone
came three minutes later really, really expecting.
everybody now going writing hill. guy
came 73rd boost testosterone assuming dead


heart attack third mile, [Andrew laughs] instead managed finish.
interpretive stuff going there, prefrontal cortex about. -
Amazing, raises question cognitive flexibility, Can tell
something good us even not enjoying it? can wriggle around
corners choosing exercise the... Personally not big fan long bouts
meditation, benefited tremendously things like dedicated breathing
shorter rounds meditation. Can tell good wriggle around
corner get physiology working way want? cognitive
flexibility? Can third place runner tell myself, well, least came in,
wanted win badly. primary goal, another goal beat
previous time, that. so, [laughs] mean, it's... extent can
toggle relationship prefrontal cortex primitive
systems? - Well, enormous amount. example, low hierarchy
generally bad health like every mammal there, including us,
something special, can part multiple hierarchies time.
maybe low ranking one them, extremely high ranking
another, like crappiest job corporation, captain
softball team year company. better bet somebody
going find sorts ways decide nine five Monday Fridays, just stupid
paying bills. really matters prestige weekend. poorer,
deacon church here. can play sorts psychological
games that. One like consistent, reliable ones need
use frontal cortex like crazy is, somebody something rotten need
attribute it. answer is, something wrong, hmm, rotten.
Always always will constitutional explanation. something
rotten somebody, explain afterward? situational one. tired,
stressed sort setting, misunderstood this. best excusing
bad things access inner lives got
prefrontal cortexes great coming situational explanation rather than,
hey, maybe just like selfish rotten human, need change.
prefrontal cortex, every time, don't let somebody merge lane
front us, even though curse somebody thing and...
Endlessly. - love it. statement fact can select multiple
hierarchies participate in. seems like particularly important one nowadays


social media prevalent. know not particularly active social
media although might pleasantly, don't know unpleasantly surprised find
lot positive discussion work, don't even
need there. just continue discuss [laughs] work.
interesting social media found context very, broad. mean,
one argue one selects follow news articles reading,
etc. can create kind funneling information can dangerous.
verification crazy ideas even just less exposure new ideas. also
idea social media incredibly broad context. scroll feed,
no longer like eighth grade classroom office faculty
meeting. exposed thousands, not millions contexts, meal,
soccer game, person's body, person's intellect. YouTube another example.
vast, vast landscape. context completely mishmash whereas assuming
evolved. think evolve contexts much constrained.
interacted limited number individuals limited number different domains,
seasons tended constrain us all. course, got phones televisions,
started expand, now ever, brain, prefrontal cortex
sense exist multiple hierarchies essentially wicked
infinity. think might interacting primitive
systems aspects biology? - Well, think get is, ways
punchline of, human humans, use
exact blueprint, hormones, kinases, receptors,
same, everything built exact stuff species
there, go use completely novel way. usually terms
able abstract stuff space time dramatic ways. So, okay, low
ranking baboon can feel badly just like killed rabbit
eat higher ranking guy boots off takes away you,
feel crummy stressful unhappy. exact
things like brain bodies losing sense self-esteem,
can watching movie character screen feeling inadequate compared
like wonderful attractive are. can somebody driving past us
expensive car, don't even see face, can feel belittled
socioeconomic status. can watch like Lifestyles Rich Famous
read Bezos to. reason, decide life less fulfilling


didn't fly space 11 minutes. can feel miserable
ways no organism can, simply can
meaningful social networks include like party reading Facebook
weren't invited taking place Singapore, don't know
people, nonetheless, somehow means

01:11:20 Dr. Sapolsky Accomplishes Deep Thinking

feel less content turned be. take steps life
actively restrict contexts think live contemplate order
enhance creative life, intellectual life? steps actively take? -
Well, actively don't know make use anything [laughs] social media.
guess counts thus actively chosen not learn how.
case certainly last year half, like lots people, gone stretches
managed sort enforce moratorium looking news,
wonderfully freeing. think larger sense though, addition
neurobiologist, sort spent decades spending part year studying wild
baboons national park East Africa. spend three months year without
electricity, without phone calls, going 12 hours day without saying word
somebody. finally would, somebody nomadic pastoralist guy
different language. Yeah, 90% like insightful thinking anything
laboratory three months year, not one lab, not
inundated stuff. - Well, think shifting trend towards trying create
narrowing context that... like see, niece, 14-years-old
friends good putting phones away. say, not
going phones interaction, especially after... realized still
somewhat this. unclear headed,

01:13:17 Free Will?

2020 restrictive separated friends. Now it's,
really focus together not bring elements phones.
brings great hope generation, [laughs] maybe will...
knows, maybe run off study baboons, need field researchers.


along lines choice, like shift gears slightly talk freewill,
ability make choices all. - Well, personal way left field inflammatory
stance is, don't think shred freewill despite 95% philosophers.
think probably majority neuroscientists saying freewill least
circumstances. don't think all. reason is,
something, behave, make choice, whatever. understand
that, intention come from? Part due like sensory
environment previous minute. hormone levels
bloodstream morning. whether wonderful
stressful last three months sort neuroplasticity happened. Part
hormone levels exposed fetus. Part culture ancestors
came with, thus parented kid.
there, can understand behavior coming without incorporating
those. point, not relevant factors,
ultimately one factor. talking evolution
behavior, definition also talking genetics. talking
genes behavior, definition talking brain
constructed proteins coded for. talking like mood
disorder now, talking sense efficacy getting five-year-
old. intertwined. look influences, basically like
challenge is, show neuron just caused behavior, show network
neurons just caused behavior. show nothing just
influenced anything sensory environment one second ago
evolution species. no space fit freewill concept
winds brain, not brain. simply no wiggle room
there. - can appreciate behaviors choices consequences
long line dominoes fell prior behavior. possible can
intervene domino effect, speak. words, can recognition
fact genes heritability, epigenome that, hormonal context,
historical context. Can knowledge give small shard
freewill? Meaning, allow say, ah, okay, accept choices
somewhat predetermined, yet knowing gives additional layer
control? philosophical biological universe works? - Nah.
can produce wonderfully positive belief change can happen. Even


traumatic change, even worst circumstances, unlikely people, change
can happen, things can change. Don't fatalistic, don't decide
mechanistic, biological machines nothing can ever... Change can happen,
people go off rails translating into, can change ourselves. don't,
can't no freewill. However, can changed circumstance.
point is, like look Aplysia, sea slug learned retract gill
response shock tail, can like conditioning, Pavlovian conditioning
it, learned, behavior changed environment. hear
news something like horrifically depressing going on, refugees wherever.
result, feel little bit helpless less sense efficacy
world, behaviors changed. Okay, okay, yeah, guess that,
remarkable thing is, exact neurobiology. signal transduction
pathways happening sea snail incorporate exact kinases
proteases phosphatases mammalian fear
conditioning, alert, conserved. exact thing, simply
playing obviously much, much fancier domain. learned
change possible despite understanding mechanistically can't change
volitionally, understand change possible, just
changed ability brain respond optimistic stimuli. changed
ability brain now send direction exposed
information will seem cheerful rather depressing. Oh God, amazing,
Nelson Mandela Martin Luther king folks did. Wow,
adverse circumstances, able do. Maybe can also, maybe can go
read people like get even data points change
neurochemistry, responses different now. tilted little bit
direction feeling like can make difference instead damn
hopeless. enormous change can happen, last thing come
view of, nothing less sum biology interactions
environment,

01:20:50 Apply Knowledge & Learning

throw hands say, thus no use trying change anything. -
can acknowledge change extremely hard impossible, circumstances


can change, yet striving better human beings still worthwhile
endeavor. correct? - Absolutely. simply knowledge, either
experience making end right neurobiology class taught
change can happen within framework mechanistic neurobiology.
now open made optimistic good news world around you.
likely inspired that, resistant getting
discouraged bad news, simply now understand possible. - Mm-hmm,
yeah, somebody spent much career working hippocampus,
assume believer neuroplasticity, neural circuits can change
response experience, so-called top-down mechanisms
prefrontal cortex talking can play role there,
decision try change pursuit knowledge pursuit experience
can shape circuitry, therefore make us different machines, speak. - Yeah.
not can say prenatal hormone exposure changed way brain
constructed, learning prenatal hormone exposure can change construction
brain will change brain right now, think
intentions came from. Wow, maybe something it. knowledge
knowledge effector itself. - important powerful
statement hear. think many people think tool, doesn't involve pill
protocol, useless. certainly pills protocols
useful variety context variety things, idea knowledge itself,
whereas put it, knowledge knowledge tool, think important
concept people embed minds. And, listen, grateful discussion
raising topics. think people, many people know work
testosterone, stress, covered today, work freewill
idea hopeless total control. think realizing
listening neither true, solution resides

01:23:44 Robert’s New Book: “Determined: Science Life Without Free Will”

understanding freewill lack it, [laughs] also neuroplasticity.
working book freewill, willing tell us little bit
book process can look forward to? - Yeah,
going really slow. Title is, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill."


essentially first half book trying convince reader, okay, not
no freewill whatsoever, least lot less normally assumed.
going standard arguments freewill, doesn't make sense
21st century science? led reading lot frustrating
philosophers basically willing admit stuff made like atoms
molecules. like physical reality sort world, not just relying
magic, believe freewill magical reasons, doesn't make
sense. Okay, first half book hopefully convince people
much less freewill used think. second half gigantic
juncture built around fact haven't thought freewill since like
adolescent. despite thinking way, still absolutely no idea
supposed function belief. supposed go everyday life
anything feel entitled isn't true? angers hatreds feel aren't justified,
no thing appropriate, blame punishment praise reward,
none makes sense, somebody like even compliments haircut,
conditioned say, oh, thanks, something do.
supposed function that? second half wrestling that,
punchline is, going incredibly hard. think going
hard subtract notion freewill making sense like serial murderers,
going thousand times harder making sense somebody says "good job"
you. [Andrew laughs] exact reality sort
interpretations. going incredibly hard, nonetheless look
history subtracted notion agency sorts realms
blame, starting thinking witches caused hailstorms 500 years ago notion
psychodynamically screwed mothers cause schizophrenia, done it.
done endless number times, able subtract sense volition
understanding world works around us. don't murderers running
amuck street, society hasn't collapsed puddle, fact,
humane society. good news possible done repeatedly
past, going hard hell. hard hell try write
coherently, [laughs] discovering, going slowly. - Well, speak many, many
people say really excited book done will
patiently wait, great excitement book, "Determined". said title,
correct? - Yeah, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill". seems like


can't publish book days without sub-title, it? - Fantastic. Well,
excited read book. grateful conversation today, learned
ton. Every time speak learn, really pleasure delight
interact today previous years, say, colleagues.

spotted. Decreasing testicle size crocodiles. [Andrew laughs] Go figure
one first contributions this. think phenomenon absolutely real.
left two classic challenges, correlated
something broad environmental toxins. ones, much, when, etc.?
one always being, well, okay, dropping dropping enough make difference.


big effect this? juries still out. - Yeah,
area know lot interest in, got groups people won't
touch receipt store BPAs inks the...
[laughs] got people don't care things. fascinating area.

00:42:15 Stress Mitigation & Sense Control

hope biology will done soon. like briefly return stress.
described study two rats, one running wheel voluntarily, one
basically stuck running wheel, forced run anytime, rat number one runs.
one case rat voluntarily exercising. [laughs] case, rat
forced go PE class, speak, really, seeing divergent effects
biology. like just touch use kind case study stress
mitigation general. rather obsessed colleague, David Spiegel, Associate
Chair Psychiatry Stanford obsessed question of, humans can start
mitigate stress? think stress mitigation
individuals families culture try encourage people
mitigate stress, ways not going turn us rat number two,
forced mitigate stress therefore becomes stressful.
[laughs] - see is, rat number one gets benefits exercise. Rat
number two gets downsides severe stress exact muscle
expenditure movements going on. Perfectly yoked, great example
interpretation head. haven't kept literature, bet you, rat
number two whole lot activity amygdala rat number one.
Okay, stress mitigation. Anything say preface with,
reasonably good telling people going happen don't manage
stress, terrible actually like managing stress advising manage that.
much better bad news aspect it. see is, now just classic
literature, half century old, sort showing building blocks stress. Not,
ooh, step outside gored elephant, can grow
experience? doesn't kill makes stronger.
stress response, realm gray zone ambiguous social
interactions, sort thing. people massive stress responses, others not
all, between, enjoy it. Like building blocks of, makes


psychological stress stressful? first one exactly brought
running study. sense control? sense control makes stressors less
stressful. running wheel shows studies you, lab rat
college freshman volunteer trained pressing lever, less likely
get shock. today lever working away unbeknownst
lever turned off, no effect shock frequency,
think control, less stress response. rat
day-in day-out, less likely get ulcer. sense
control. related sense predictability. Rat get shocked, human gets
shocked, whatever, scenario either shocks come now then,
shocks come now then, 10 seconds little warning light comes on.
get warning light, shocks distressful. got predictability
not getting warning lights, second half second away
next shock. get warning light, know isn't one, got
least 10 seconds worth relaxation. know coming, can prepare
coping responses, best afterward know finally safe,
can recover it. enormously protective. Others outlet frustration,
take rat getting shocked, run running wheel,
protective thing, voluntarily. got rat can gnaw bar
wood, stressor less stressful. Unfortunately, rat primate human
stressed, ability aggressively dump somebody smaller weaker
also reduces stress response. fact displacement aggression reduces
stress accounts huge percent triggers like unhappiness.
variables, get social support well. good one. Interpreting circumstances
good news rather bad. Hurray, got simple sort like take
home recipe go get much control much predictability many
outlets much social support possible, going just fine.
go that, recipe total disaster much, much
subtle that. one great example, okay, getting shocks, want
warning beforehand, get little warning light 10 seconds shock,
wonderfully protective. Get warning light one second shock doesn't
anything. not enough time get psychological benefits
anticipation. Now instead, gets little warning coming two minutes
shock, going make things worse not going sitting


like reveling sort sense predictability, soon going be, oh.
going sitting two minutes saying, damn, comes. Predictive
information works narrow domain. Similarly, control. want
sense control face stress? answer is, mild moderate
stressor happening then, sense control completely
independent reality whether control not, face mild
moderate stressors, sense control gets interpreted as, wow, look much worse
things been. Thank God, control, top master fate.
contrast, major stressor, arbitrary sense control make
think, oh God, look much better been. prevented it.
know intuitively like face people's worst stressors.
Nobody stopped car way kids suddenly jumped out. wouldn't
mattered gotten doctor month ago, instead now,
wouldn't made any... didn't actually control. see is,
absolutely want huge sense control mild moderate stressors,
especially ones result good outcome. Hooray, me, face horrible
stressors, want like self-deception, like truth beauty don't
necessarily go hand-in-hand point. stress management techniques
impact control predictability wind far worse neutral preaching
somebody homeless somebody terminal cancer, somebody
refugee. Tell neurotic middle-class person psychological tools
turn hell heaven. truth that. thing somebody
going real hell, just privileged heartlessness
doesn't work. outlets, outlets damaging,
not good way mitigate stress. Social support, confusing mere
acquaintances real social support, going rug pulled
point. mistaking social support being, going bitching
moaning demanding supportiveness everyone around rather
reciprocally, not going work well either. not simple.
not nothing lots us really lousy. It, like good friends things
like that, takes lot work right? wrong may
temporarily seem like great thing, turns completely misplaced
faith, going feeling worse started.



00:51:35 Best Buffer Stress

- Interesting. days, lot interest using physical practices mitigate
stress, trying get ruminating, extent take control neural
circuits brain using exercise using breathing hypnosis. And, course,
hypnosis mental component well. thoughts stress mitigation
standpoint of, okay, don't want rat number two, want select
something ourselves, take initiative ourselves. forced
exercising not, actually negative health effect perhaps. need
pick something like, need take control it. terms supporting
people, touched bit. best way support people?
talk stressful thing? mean, not asking play psychologist here,
find divergent data this. can spin lather ruminating
something. language seems like wonderful tool, also fairly
deprived tool doesn't really get core physiology like something
like breathing would. thoughts more, lack better way put
it, head-centered, cognitive approaches stress mitigation versus kind going
core physiology. Cold showers now even thing extent just get
people stress acclimated, voluntarily taking cold showers. - makes sense
physiologically, preconditioning real stressors come. terms
bring up, oh, transcendental meditation, mindfulness, exercise, prayer, sort reflecting
gratitude, sort thing. Collectively work average, work
terms of, can lower heart rate cholesterol levels sorts good
outcomes, compromise us. One exactly caveat comes
running wheel study is, doesn't matter many friends swear stress
management technique. makes want scream head off 10
seconds, not one going work you. read fine print
testimonials, got something works you. Another one stress
management type techniques work, can't save weekend, can't
save stuck hold phone Muzak two minutes.
got something stop virtually, daily every
day, spend 20, 30 minutes it. see coming
like 80/20 rule economics. 80/20, 80% complaints store come
20% customers, things like that. see is, entire life consists


every single thing shoulders, can't say no 24/7. stopped
finally said, wellbeing important enough finally get say no
stuff can't say no to. going every day 20 minutes,
whatever stress management technique 20 minutes sort
knows what, already 80% way simply decided
wellbeing important enough going stop every single day
priority. exactly finding find people chronic
depression untreated merely calling getting appointment see mental
health professional, people start feeling better already evidence
activated, matter enough this, conceive
actually good outcome rather hopeless one. Just something
meditative reflective every day so, hardly even matters one
doing. comes thus another warning, not trust anybody
says, scientifically proven brand stress management works
better ones. Just watch wallet point. - Yeah, amen. think one
core goals lab David Spiegel's lab, know worked
David published papers David well really try find
various entry points thing call autonomic nervous system
stress system, systems gone unchecked really can take us
dark path. idea many entry points really one keeps,
data keep telling us again. no magic breathing tool
exercise, variety one those. And, again, come back idea
one select one make space for, one
hopefully enjoy going work best terms physiology. - [mumbles]
benign people stuck around you.

00:57:04 Power Perception, Choice & Individual Differences

- Right, right, absolutely. brings question of, find amazing
perceive event, whether not chose event not can
incredible different effects circuitry brain circuitry body
biology cells. ways boggles mind, like can decision made
presumably prefrontal cortex, although parts brain well, can
change essentially polarity response body. And, mean, talked


Type personalities there. don't go detail
sake time, interesting effects endothelial cells. mean, literally
size of, [laughs] portals blood opposite direction, depending
whether not somebody wants situation highly motivated person. Maybe
just give us top contour think really illustrates
principle beautifully. maybe would, just speculate
brain might switch turn one experience terrible beneficial
beneficial terrible, really fascinating. - Well, need like tonight
going sleep lying bed nice drowsy
heart's beating nice slow, start thinking fact heart isn't going
beat forever. [Andrew laughs] imagine toes getting cold afterward
imagine flow blood coming halt clotting. going
something physiology point 99% mammals
running frantically. going turning sympathetic
stress response thought, emotions, memory. measure
just much cortex limbic system sends projections
autonomic regulators brain. can think autonomic regulatory neurons
action ways animals can like extremes environmental
circumstances. given autonomic rule, mean, big challenge
understanding gigantic individual differences. that's, talk
optimal amount stress, counts stimulation, general stress not
severe doesn't go long overall benevolence setting.
conditions, love stressed something unexpected
control predictability like really interesting plot turn movie watching.
great, get individual differences somehow accommodate
fact people, perfect stimulatory amount stress like getting
early Audubon birdwatching walk next Sunday morning. somebody else,
signing like mercenary Yemen. [Andrew laughs]

01:00:32 Context-Setting, Prefrontal Cortex & Hierarchy

tremendous individual differences swamp simple prescriptions. - Yeah,
prefrontal cortex, thinking machinery harbor, double-edged
sword. remarkable is, areas brain like hypothalamus


amygdala, sort like switches. mean, context gain
control. talked gain control testosterone, etc., really like
switches. mean, stimulate ventromedial hypothalamus, get right neurons,
animal will try kill even object sitting next it. tickle
neurons, it'll try mate object. mean, really wild. think
probably rules prefrontal cortex also, sounds like context plural
prefrontal cortex can draw probably infinite, probably learn
perceive threat anything. Whether not another group whether not
science whether not somebody's version shape earth versus
another. mean, like, can plug anything system give enough data,
think sounds like drive fear response love response.
overstepping? - [laughs] mixed horribly ambivalent one changing
millisecond, like mutually contradictory. No, absolutely case
prefrontal cortex, regretted like wasted 30 years
life studying hippocampus shoot studied prefrontal cortex
much interesting does, contextual stuff.
ways not okay lie setting, great thing another.
not okay kill unless them, get medal. not,
social context moral relativity situational ethic stuff, prefrontal cortex
got master that. winds meaning place brain
anywhere say perception things can powerfully influence
reality coming you. - Yeah. - mean, great example, just harking back
testosterone. Okay, exercise boosts testosterone levels. exercise
success exercise failure? literature back 80s looking
outcomes marathons. testosterone rise people win
losers? Wrestling matches. Things sort simple prediction answer
wound being, didn't see simple answer. Okay, win marathon, not
necessarily predictor increased testosterone. about? find
like winner testosterone decreases, find guy came 73rd
massive testosterone increase. Whoa, about?
far human subtlety. guy won race decline testosterone
came three minutes later really, really expecting.
everybody now going writing hill. guy
came 73rd boost testosterone assuming dead


heart attack third mile, [Andrew laughs] instead managed finish.
interpretive stuff going there, prefrontal cortex about. -
Amazing, raises question cognitive flexibility, Can tell
something good us even not enjoying it? can wriggle around
corners choosing exercise the... Personally not big fan long bouts
meditation, benefited tremendously things like dedicated breathing
shorter rounds meditation. Can tell good wriggle around
corner get physiology working way want? cognitive
flexibility? Can third place runner tell myself, well, least came in,
wanted win badly. primary goal, another goal beat
previous time, that. so, [laughs] mean, it's... extent can
toggle relationship prefrontal cortex primitive
systems? - Well, enormous amount. example, low hierarchy
generally bad health like every mammal there, including us,
something special, can part multiple hierarchies time.
maybe low ranking one them, extremely high ranking
another, like crappiest job corporation, captain
softball team year company. better bet somebody
going find sorts ways decide nine five Monday Fridays, just stupid
paying bills. really matters prestige weekend. poorer,
deacon church here. can play sorts psychological
games that. One like consistent, reliable ones need
use frontal cortex like crazy is, somebody something rotten need
attribute it. answer is, something wrong, hmm, rotten.
Always always will constitutional explanation. something
rotten somebody, explain afterward? situational one. tired,
stressed sort setting, misunderstood this. best excusing
bad things access inner lives got
prefrontal cortexes great coming situational explanation rather than,
hey, maybe just like selfish rotten human, need change.
prefrontal cortex, every time, don't let somebody merge lane
front us, even though curse somebody thing and...
Endlessly. - love it. statement fact can select multiple
hierarchies participate in. seems like particularly important one nowadays


social media prevalent. know not particularly active social
media although might pleasantly, don't know unpleasantly surprised find
lot positive discussion work, don't even
need there. just continue discuss [laughs] work.
interesting social media found context very, broad. mean,
one argue one selects follow news articles reading,
etc. can create kind funneling information can dangerous.
verification crazy ideas even just less exposure new ideas. also
idea social media incredibly broad context. scroll feed,
no longer like eighth grade classroom office faculty
meeting. exposed thousands, not millions contexts, meal,
soccer game, person's body, person's intellect. YouTube another example.
vast, vast landscape. context completely mishmash whereas assuming
evolved. think evolve contexts much constrained.
interacted limited number individuals limited number different domains,
seasons tended constrain us all. course, got phones televisions,
started expand, now ever, brain, prefrontal cortex
sense exist multiple hierarchies essentially wicked
infinity. think might interacting primitive
systems aspects biology? - Well, think get is, ways
punchline of, human humans, use
exact blueprint, hormones, kinases, receptors,
same, everything built exact stuff species
there, go use completely novel way. usually terms
able abstract stuff space time dramatic ways. So, okay, low
ranking baboon can feel badly just like killed rabbit
eat higher ranking guy boots off takes away you,
feel crummy stressful unhappy. exact
things like brain bodies losing sense self-esteem,
can watching movie character screen feeling inadequate compared
like wonderful attractive are. can somebody driving past us
expensive car, don't even see face, can feel belittled
socioeconomic status. can watch like Lifestyles Rich Famous
read Bezos to. reason, decide life less fulfilling


didn't fly space 11 minutes. can feel miserable
ways no organism can, simply can
meaningful social networks include like party reading Facebook
weren't invited taking place Singapore, don't know
people, nonetheless, somehow means

01:11:20 Dr. Sapolsky Accomplishes Deep Thinking

feel less content turned be. take steps life
actively restrict contexts think live contemplate order
enhance creative life, intellectual life? steps actively take? -
Well, actively don't know make use anything [laughs] social media.
guess counts thus actively chosen not learn how.
case certainly last year half, like lots people, gone stretches
managed sort enforce moratorium looking news,
wonderfully freeing. think larger sense though, addition
neurobiologist, sort spent decades spending part year studying wild
baboons national park East Africa. spend three months year without
electricity, without phone calls, going 12 hours day without saying word
somebody. finally would, somebody nomadic pastoralist guy
different language. Yeah, 90% like insightful thinking anything
laboratory three months year, not one lab, not
inundated stuff. - Well, think shifting trend towards trying create
narrowing context that... like see, niece, 14-years-old
friends good putting phones away. say, not
going phones interaction, especially after... realized still
somewhat this. unclear headed,

01:13:17 Free Will?

2020 restrictive separated friends. Now it's,
really focus together not bring elements phones.
brings great hope generation, [laughs] maybe will...
knows, maybe run off study baboons, need field researchers.


along lines choice, like shift gears slightly talk freewill,
ability make choices all. - Well, personal way left field inflammatory
stance is, don't think shred freewill despite 95% philosophers.
think probably majority neuroscientists saying freewill least
circumstances. don't think all. reason is,
something, behave, make choice, whatever. understand
that, intention come from? Part due like sensory
environment previous minute. hormone levels
bloodstream morning. whether wonderful
stressful last three months sort neuroplasticity happened. Part
hormone levels exposed fetus. Part culture ancestors
came with, thus parented kid.
there, can understand behavior coming without incorporating
those. point, not relevant factors,
ultimately one factor. talking evolution
behavior, definition also talking genetics. talking
genes behavior, definition talking brain
constructed proteins coded for. talking like mood
disorder now, talking sense efficacy getting five-year-
old. intertwined. look influences, basically like
challenge is, show neuron just caused behavior, show network
neurons just caused behavior. show nothing just
influenced anything sensory environment one second ago
evolution species. no space fit freewill concept
winds brain, not brain. simply no wiggle room
there. - can appreciate behaviors choices consequences
long line dominoes fell prior behavior. possible can
intervene domino effect, speak. words, can recognition
fact genes heritability, epigenome that, hormonal context,
historical context. Can knowledge give small shard
freewill? Meaning, allow say, ah, okay, accept choices
somewhat predetermined, yet knowing gives additional layer
control? philosophical biological universe works? - Nah.
can produce wonderfully positive belief change can happen. Even


traumatic change, even worst circumstances, unlikely people, change
can happen, things can change. Don't fatalistic, don't decide
mechanistic, biological machines nothing can ever... Change can happen,
people go off rails translating into, can change ourselves. don't,
can't no freewill. However, can changed circumstance.
point is, like look Aplysia, sea slug learned retract gill
response shock tail, can like conditioning, Pavlovian conditioning
it, learned, behavior changed environment. hear
news something like horrifically depressing going on, refugees wherever.
result, feel little bit helpless less sense efficacy
world, behaviors changed. Okay, okay, yeah, guess that,
remarkable thing is, exact neurobiology. signal transduction
pathways happening sea snail incorporate exact kinases
proteases phosphatases mammalian fear
conditioning, alert, conserved. exact thing, simply
playing obviously much, much fancier domain. learned
change possible despite understanding mechanistically can't change
volitionally, understand change possible, just
changed ability brain respond optimistic stimuli. changed
ability brain now send direction exposed
information will seem cheerful rather depressing. Oh God, amazing,
Nelson Mandela Martin Luther king folks did. Wow,
adverse circumstances, able do. Maybe can also, maybe can go
read people like get even data points change
neurochemistry, responses different now. tilted little bit
direction feeling like can make difference instead damn
hopeless. enormous change can happen, last thing come
view of, nothing less sum biology interactions
environment,

01:20:50 Apply Knowledge & Learning

throw hands say, thus no use trying change anything. -
can acknowledge change extremely hard impossible, circumstances


can change, yet striving better human beings still worthwhile
endeavor. correct? - Absolutely. simply knowledge, either
experience making end right neurobiology class taught
change can happen within framework mechanistic neurobiology.
now open made optimistic good news world around you.
likely inspired that, resistant getting
discouraged bad news, simply now understand possible. - Mm-hmm,
yeah, somebody spent much career working hippocampus,
assume believer neuroplasticity, neural circuits can change
response experience, so-called top-down mechanisms
prefrontal cortex talking can play role there,
decision try change pursuit knowledge pursuit experience
can shape circuitry, therefore make us different machines, speak. - Yeah.
not can say prenatal hormone exposure changed way brain
constructed, learning prenatal hormone exposure can change construction
brain will change brain right now, think
intentions came from. Wow, maybe something it. knowledge
knowledge effector itself. - important powerful
statement hear. think many people think tool, doesn't involve pill
protocol, useless. certainly pills protocols
useful variety context variety things, idea knowledge itself,
whereas put it, knowledge knowledge tool, think important
concept people embed minds. And, listen, grateful discussion
raising topics. think people, many people know work
testosterone, stress, covered today, work freewill
idea hopeless total control. think realizing
listening neither true, solution resides

01:23:44 Robert’s New Book: “Determined: Science Life Without Free Will”

understanding freewill lack it, [laughs] also neuroplasticity.
working book freewill, willing tell us little bit
book process can look forward to? - Yeah,
going really slow. Title is, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill."


essentially first half book trying convince reader, okay, not
no freewill whatsoever, least lot less normally assumed.
going standard arguments freewill, doesn't make sense
21st century science? led reading lot frustrating
philosophers basically willing admit stuff made like atoms
molecules. like physical reality sort world, not just relying
magic, believe freewill magical reasons, doesn't make
sense. Okay, first half book hopefully convince people
much less freewill used think. second half gigantic
juncture built around fact haven't thought freewill since like
adolescent. despite thinking way, still absolutely no idea
supposed function belief. supposed go everyday life
anything feel entitled isn't true? angers hatreds feel aren't justified,
no thing appropriate, blame punishment praise reward,
none makes sense, somebody like even compliments haircut,
conditioned say, oh, thanks, something do.
supposed function that? second half wrestling that,
punchline is, going incredibly hard. think going
hard subtract notion freewill making sense like serial murderers,
going thousand times harder making sense somebody says "good job"
you. [Andrew laughs] exact reality sort
interpretations. going incredibly hard, nonetheless look
history subtracted notion agency sorts realms
blame, starting thinking witches caused hailstorms 500 years ago notion
psychodynamically screwed mothers cause schizophrenia, done it.
done endless number times, able subtract sense volition
understanding world works around us. don't murderers running
amuck street, society hasn't collapsed puddle, fact,
humane society. good news possible done repeatedly
past, going hard hell. hard hell try write
coherently, [laughs] discovering, going slowly. - Well, speak many, many
people say really excited book done will
patiently wait, great excitement book, "Determined". said title,
correct? - Yeah, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill". seems like


can't publish book days without sub-title, it? - Fantastic. Well,
excited read book. grateful conversation today, learned
ton. Every time speak learn, really pleasure delight
interact today previous years, say, colleagues.
thank again, Robert, everything hard, hard work
thinking put work clear put lot hard work

01:00:32 Context-Setting, Prefrontal Cortex & Hierarchy

tremendous individual differences swamp simple prescriptions. - Yeah,
prefrontal cortex, thinking machinery harbor, double-edged
sword. remarkable is, areas brain like hypothalamus


amygdala, sort like switches. mean, context gain
control. talked gain control testosterone, etc., really like
switches. mean, stimulate ventromedial hypothalamus, get right neurons,
animal will try kill even object sitting next it. tickle
neurons, it'll try mate object. mean, really wild. think
probably rules prefrontal cortex also, sounds like context plural
prefrontal cortex can draw probably infinite, probably learn
perceive threat anything. Whether not another group whether not
science whether not somebody's version shape earth versus
another. mean, like, can plug anything system give enough data,
think sounds like drive fear response love response.
overstepping? - [laughs] mixed horribly ambivalent one changing
millisecond, like mutually contradictory. No, absolutely case
prefrontal cortex, regretted like wasted 30 years
life studying hippocampus shoot studied prefrontal cortex
much interesting does, contextual stuff.
ways not okay lie setting, great thing another.
not okay kill unless them, get medal. not,
social context moral relativity situational ethic stuff, prefrontal cortex
got master that. winds meaning place brain
anywhere say perception things can powerfully influence
reality coming you. - Yeah. - mean, great example, just harking back
testosterone. Okay, exercise boosts testosterone levels. exercise
success exercise failure? literature back 80s looking
outcomes marathons. testosterone rise people win
losers? Wrestling matches. Things sort simple prediction answer
wound being, didn't see simple answer. Okay, win marathon, not
necessarily predictor increased testosterone. about? find
like winner testosterone decreases, find guy came 73rd
massive testosterone increase. Whoa, about?
far human subtlety. guy won race decline testosterone
came three minutes later really, really expecting.
everybody now going writing hill. guy
came 73rd boost testosterone assuming dead


heart attack third mile, [Andrew laughs] instead managed finish.
interpretive stuff going there, prefrontal cortex about. -
Amazing, raises question cognitive flexibility, Can tell
something good us even not enjoying it? can wriggle around
corners choosing exercise the... Personally not big fan long bouts
meditation, benefited tremendously things like dedicated breathing
shorter rounds meditation. Can tell good wriggle around
corner get physiology working way want? cognitive
flexibility? Can third place runner tell myself, well, least came in,
wanted win badly. primary goal, another goal beat
previous time, that. so, [laughs] mean, it's... extent can
toggle relationship prefrontal cortex primitive
systems? - Well, enormous amount. example, low hierarchy
generally bad health like every mammal there, including us,
something special, can part multiple hierarchies time.
maybe low ranking one them, extremely high ranking
another, like crappiest job corporation, captain
softball team year company. better bet somebody
going find sorts ways decide nine five Monday Fridays, just stupid
paying bills. really matters prestige weekend. poorer,
deacon church here. can play sorts psychological
games that. One like consistent, reliable ones need
use frontal cortex like crazy is, somebody something rotten need
attribute it. answer is, something wrong, hmm, rotten.
Always always will constitutional explanation. something
rotten somebody, explain afterward? situational one. tired,
stressed sort setting, misunderstood this. best excusing
bad things access inner lives got
prefrontal cortexes great coming situational explanation rather than,
hey, maybe just like selfish rotten human, need change.
prefrontal cortex, every time, don't let somebody merge lane
front us, even though curse somebody thing and...
Endlessly. - love it. statement fact can select multiple
hierarchies participate in. seems like particularly important one nowadays


social media prevalent. know not particularly active social
media although might pleasantly, don't know unpleasantly surprised find
lot positive discussion work, don't even
need there. just continue discuss [laughs] work.
interesting social media found context very, broad. mean,
one argue one selects follow news articles reading,
etc. can create kind funneling information can dangerous.
verification crazy ideas even just less exposure new ideas. also
idea social media incredibly broad context. scroll feed,
no longer like eighth grade classroom office faculty
meeting. exposed thousands, not millions contexts, meal,
soccer game, person's body, person's intellect. YouTube another example.
vast, vast landscape. context completely mishmash whereas assuming
evolved. think evolve contexts much constrained.
interacted limited number individuals limited number different domains,
seasons tended constrain us all. course, got phones televisions,
started expand, now ever, brain, prefrontal cortex
sense exist multiple hierarchies essentially wicked
infinity. think might interacting primitive
systems aspects biology? - Well, think get is, ways
punchline of, human humans, use
exact blueprint, hormones, kinases, receptors,
same, everything built exact stuff species
there, go use completely novel way. usually terms
able abstract stuff space time dramatic ways. So, okay, low
ranking baboon can feel badly just like killed rabbit
eat higher ranking guy boots off takes away you,
feel crummy stressful unhappy. exact
things like brain bodies losing sense self-esteem,
can watching movie character screen feeling inadequate compared
like wonderful attractive are. can somebody driving past us
expensive car, don't even see face, can feel belittled
socioeconomic status. can watch like Lifestyles Rich Famous
read Bezos to. reason, decide life less fulfilling


didn't fly space 11 minutes. can feel miserable
ways no organism can, simply can
meaningful social networks include like party reading Facebook
weren't invited taking place Singapore, don't know
people, nonetheless, somehow means

01:11:20 Dr. Sapolsky Accomplishes Deep Thinking

feel less content turned be. take steps life
actively restrict contexts think live contemplate order
enhance creative life, intellectual life? steps actively take? -
Well, actively don't know make use anything [laughs] social media.
guess counts thus actively chosen not learn how.
case certainly last year half, like lots people, gone stretches
managed sort enforce moratorium looking news,
wonderfully freeing. think larger sense though, addition
neurobiologist, sort spent decades spending part year studying wild
baboons national park East Africa. spend three months year without
electricity, without phone calls, going 12 hours day without saying word
somebody. finally would, somebody nomadic pastoralist guy
different language. Yeah, 90% like insightful thinking anything
laboratory three months year, not one lab, not
inundated stuff. - Well, think shifting trend towards trying create
narrowing context that... like see, niece, 14-years-old
friends good putting phones away. say, not
going phones interaction, especially after... realized still
somewhat this. unclear headed,

01:13:17 Free Will?

2020 restrictive separated friends. Now it's,
really focus together not bring elements phones.
brings great hope generation, [laughs] maybe will...
knows, maybe run off study baboons, need field researchers.


along lines choice, like shift gears slightly talk freewill,
ability make choices all. - Well, personal way left field inflammatory
stance is, don't think shred freewill despite 95% philosophers.
think probably majority neuroscientists saying freewill least
circumstances. don't think all. reason is,
something, behave, make choice, whatever. understand
that, intention come from? Part due like sensory
environment previous minute. hormone levels
bloodstream morning. whether wonderful
stressful last three months sort neuroplasticity happened. Part
hormone levels exposed fetus. Part culture ancestors
came with, thus parented kid.
there, can understand behavior coming without incorporating
those. point, not relevant factors,
ultimately one factor. talking evolution
behavior, definition also talking genetics. talking
genes behavior, definition talking brain
constructed proteins coded for. talking like mood
disorder now, talking sense efficacy getting five-year-
old. intertwined. look influences, basically like
challenge is, show neuron just caused behavior, show network
neurons just caused behavior. show nothing just
influenced anything sensory environment one second ago
evolution species. no space fit freewill concept
winds brain, not brain. simply no wiggle room
there. - can appreciate behaviors choices consequences
long line dominoes fell prior behavior. possible can
intervene domino effect, speak. words, can recognition
fact genes heritability, epigenome that, hormonal context,
historical context. Can knowledge give small shard
freewill? Meaning, allow say, ah, okay, accept choices
somewhat predetermined, yet knowing gives additional layer
control? philosophical biological universe works? - Nah.
can produce wonderfully positive belief change can happen. Even


traumatic change, even worst circumstances, unlikely people, change
can happen, things can change. Don't fatalistic, don't decide
mechanistic, biological machines nothing can ever... Change can happen,
people go off rails translating into, can change ourselves. don't,
can't no freewill. However, can changed circumstance.
point is, like look Aplysia, sea slug learned retract gill
response shock tail, can like conditioning, Pavlovian conditioning
it, learned, behavior changed environment. hear
news something like horrifically depressing going on, refugees wherever.
result, feel little bit helpless less sense efficacy
world, behaviors changed. Okay, okay, yeah, guess that,
remarkable thing is, exact neurobiology. signal transduction
pathways happening sea snail incorporate exact kinases
proteases phosphatases mammalian fear
conditioning, alert, conserved. exact thing, simply
playing obviously much, much fancier domain. learned
change possible despite understanding mechanistically can't change
volitionally, understand change possible, just
changed ability brain respond optimistic stimuli. changed
ability brain now send direction exposed
information will seem cheerful rather depressing. Oh God, amazing,
Nelson Mandela Martin Luther king folks did. Wow,
adverse circumstances, able do. Maybe can also, maybe can go
read people like get even data points change
neurochemistry, responses different now. tilted little bit
direction feeling like can make difference instead damn
hopeless. enormous change can happen, last thing come
view of, nothing less sum biology interactions
environment,

01:20:50 Apply Knowledge & Learning

throw hands say, thus no use trying change anything. -
can acknowledge change extremely hard impossible, circumstances


can change, yet striving better human beings still worthwhile
endeavor. correct? - Absolutely. simply knowledge, either
experience making end right neurobiology class taught
change can happen within framework mechanistic neurobiology.
now open made optimistic good news world around you.
likely inspired that, resistant getting
discouraged bad news, simply now understand possible. - Mm-hmm,
yeah, somebody spent much career working hippocampus,
assume believer neuroplasticity, neural circuits can change
response experience, so-called top-down mechanisms
prefrontal cortex talking can play role there,
decision try change pursuit knowledge pursuit experience
can shape circuitry, therefore make us different machines, speak. - Yeah.
not can say prenatal hormone exposure changed way brain
constructed, learning prenatal hormone exposure can change construction
brain will change brain right now, think
intentions came from. Wow, maybe something it. knowledge
knowledge effector itself. - important powerful
statement hear. think many people think tool, doesn't involve pill
protocol, useless. certainly pills protocols
useful variety context variety things, idea knowledge itself,
whereas put it, knowledge knowledge tool, think important
concept people embed minds. And, listen, grateful discussion
raising topics. think people, many people know work
testosterone, stress, covered today, work freewill
idea hopeless total control. think realizing
listening neither true, solution resides

01:23:44 Robert’s New Book: “Determined: Science Life Without Free Will”

understanding freewill lack it, [laughs] also neuroplasticity.
working book freewill, willing tell us little bit
book process can look forward to? - Yeah,
going really slow. Title is, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill."


essentially first half book trying convince reader, okay, not
no freewill whatsoever, least lot less normally assumed.
going standard arguments freewill, doesn't make sense
21st century science? led reading lot frustrating
philosophers basically willing admit stuff made like atoms
molecules. like physical reality sort world, not just relying
magic, believe freewill magical reasons, doesn't make
sense. Okay, first half book hopefully convince people
much less freewill used think. second half gigantic
juncture built around fact haven't thought freewill since like
adolescent. despite thinking way, still absolutely no idea
supposed function belief. supposed go everyday life
anything feel entitled isn't true? angers hatreds feel aren't justified,
no thing appropriate, blame punishment praise reward,
none makes sense, somebody like even compliments haircut,
conditioned say, oh, thanks, something do.
supposed function that? second half wrestling that,
punchline is, going incredibly hard. think going
hard subtract notion freewill making sense like serial murderers,
going thousand times harder making sense somebody says "good job"
you. [Andrew laughs] exact reality sort
interpretations. going incredibly hard, nonetheless look
history subtracted notion agency sorts realms
blame, starting thinking witches caused hailstorms 500 years ago notion
psychodynamically screwed mothers cause schizophrenia, done it.
done endless number times, able subtract sense volition
understanding world works around us. don't murderers running
amuck street, society hasn't collapsed puddle, fact,
humane society. good news possible done repeatedly
past, going hard hell. hard hell try write
coherently, [laughs] discovering, going slowly. - Well, speak many, many
people say really excited book done will
patiently wait, great excitement book, "Determined". said title,
correct? - Yeah, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill". seems like


can't publish book days without sub-title, it? - Fantastic. Well,
excited read book. grateful conversation today, learned
ton. Every time speak learn, really pleasure delight
interact today previous years, say, colleagues.
thank again, Robert, everything hard, hard work
thinking put work clear put lot hard work

psychological stress stressful? first one exactly brought
running study. sense control? sense control makes stressors less
stressful. running wheel shows studies you, lab rat
college freshman volunteer trained pressing lever, less likely
get shock. today lever working away unbeknownst
lever turned off, no effect shock frequency,
think control, less stress response. rat
day-in day-out, less likely get ulcer. sense
control. related sense predictability. Rat get shocked, human gets
shocked, whatever, scenario either shocks come now then,
shocks come now then, 10 seconds little warning light comes on.
get warning light, shocks distressful. got predictability
not getting warning lights, second half second away
next shock. get warning light, know isn't one, got
least 10 seconds worth relaxation. know coming, can prepare
coping responses, best afterward know finally safe,
can recover it. enormously protective. Others outlet frustration,
take rat getting shocked, run running wheel,
protective thing, voluntarily. got rat can gnaw bar
wood, stressor less stressful. Unfortunately, rat primate human
stressed, ability aggressively dump somebody smaller weaker
also reduces stress response. fact displacement aggression reduces
stress accounts huge percent triggers like unhappiness.
variables, get social support well. good one. Interpreting circumstances
good news rather bad. Hurray, got simple sort like take
home recipe go get much control much predictability many
outlets much social support possible, going just fine.
go that, recipe total disaster much, much
subtle that. one great example, okay, getting shocks, want
warning beforehand, get little warning light 10 seconds shock,
wonderfully protective. Get warning light one second shock doesn't
anything. not enough time get psychological benefits
anticipation. Now instead, gets little warning coming two minutes
shock, going make things worse not going sitting


like reveling sort sense predictability, soon going be, oh.
going sitting two minutes saying, damn, comes. Predictive
information works narrow domain. Similarly, control. want
sense control face stress? answer is, mild moderate
stressor happening then, sense control completely
independent reality whether control not, face mild
moderate stressors, sense control gets interpreted as, wow, look much worse
things been. Thank God, control, top master fate.
contrast, major stressor, arbitrary sense control make
think, oh God, look much better been. prevented it.
know intuitively like face people's worst stressors.
Nobody stopped car way kids suddenly jumped out. wouldn't
mattered gotten doctor month ago, instead now,
wouldn't made any... didn't actually control. see is,
absolutely want huge sense control mild moderate stressors,
especially ones result good outcome. Hooray, me, face horrible
stressors, want like self-deception, like truth beauty don't
necessarily go hand-in-hand point. stress management techniques
impact control predictability wind far worse neutral preaching
somebody homeless somebody terminal cancer, somebody
refugee. Tell neurotic middle-class person psychological tools
turn hell heaven. truth that. thing somebody
going real hell, just privileged heartlessness
doesn't work. outlets, outlets damaging,
not good way mitigate stress. Social support, confusing mere
acquaintances real social support, going rug pulled
point. mistaking social support being, going bitching
moaning demanding supportiveness everyone around rather
reciprocally, not going work well either. not simple.
not nothing lots us really lousy. It, like good friends things
like that, takes lot work right? wrong may
temporarily seem like great thing, turns completely misplaced
faith, going feeling worse started.



00:51:35 Best Buffer Stress

- Interesting. days, lot interest using physical practices mitigate
stress, trying get ruminating, extent take control neural
circuits brain using exercise using breathing hypnosis. And, course,
hypnosis mental component well. thoughts stress mitigation
standpoint of, okay, don't want rat number two, want select
something ourselves, take initiative ourselves. forced
exercising not, actually negative health effect perhaps. need
pick something like, need take control it. terms supporting
people, touched bit. best way support people?
talk stressful thing? mean, not asking play psychologist here,
find divergent data this. can spin lather ruminating
something. language seems like wonderful tool, also fairly
deprived tool doesn't really get core physiology like something
like breathing would. thoughts more, lack better way put
it, head-centered, cognitive approaches stress mitigation versus kind going
core physiology. Cold showers now even thing extent just get
people stress acclimated, voluntarily taking cold showers. - makes sense
physiologically, preconditioning real stressors come. terms
bring up, oh, transcendental meditation, mindfulness, exercise, prayer, sort reflecting
gratitude, sort thing. Collectively work average, work
terms of, can lower heart rate cholesterol levels sorts good
outcomes, compromise us. One exactly caveat comes
running wheel study is, doesn't matter many friends swear stress
management technique. makes want scream head off 10
seconds, not one going work you. read fine print
testimonials, got something works you. Another one stress
management type techniques work, can't save weekend, can't
save stuck hold phone Muzak two minutes.
got something stop virtually, daily every
day, spend 20, 30 minutes it. see coming
like 80/20 rule economics. 80/20, 80% complaints store come
20% customers, things like that. see is, entire life consists


every single thing shoulders, can't say no 24/7. stopped
finally said, wellbeing important enough finally get say no
stuff can't say no to. going every day 20 minutes,
whatever stress management technique 20 minutes sort
knows what, already 80% way simply decided
wellbeing important enough going stop every single day
priority. exactly finding find people chronic
depression untreated merely calling getting appointment see mental
health professional, people start feeling better already evidence
activated, matter enough this, conceive
actually good outcome rather hopeless one. Just something
meditative reflective every day so, hardly even matters one
doing. comes thus another warning, not trust anybody
says, scientifically proven brand stress management works
better ones. Just watch wallet point. - Yeah, amen. think one
core goals lab David Spiegel's lab, know worked
David published papers David well really try find
various entry points thing call autonomic nervous system
stress system, systems gone unchecked really can take us
dark path. idea many entry points really one keeps,
data keep telling us again. no magic breathing tool
exercise, variety one those. And, again, come back idea
one select one make space for, one
hopefully enjoy going work best terms physiology. - [mumbles]
benign people stuck around you.

00:57:04 Power Perception, Choice & Individual Differences

point is, like look Aplysia, sea slug learned retract gill
response shock tail, can like conditioning, Pavlovian conditioning
it, learned, behavior changed environment. hear
news something like horrifically depressing going on, refugees wherever.
result, feel little bit helpless less sense efficacy
world, behaviors changed. Okay, okay, yeah, guess that,
remarkable thing is, exact neurobiology. signal transduction
pathways happening sea snail incorporate exact kinases
proteases phosphatases mammalian fear
conditioning, alert, conserved. exact thing, simply
playing obviously much, much fancier domain. learned
change possible despite understanding mechanistically can't change
volitionally, understand change possible, just
changed ability brain respond optimistic stimuli. changed
ability brain now send direction exposed
information will seem cheerful rather depressing. Oh God, amazing,
Nelson Mandela Martin Luther king folks did. Wow,
adverse circumstances, able do. Maybe can also, maybe can go
read people like get even data points change
neurochemistry, responses different now. tilted little bit
direction feeling like can make difference instead damn
hopeless. enormous change can happen, last thing come
view of, nothing less sum biology interactions
environment,

01:20:50 Apply Knowledge & Learning

throw hands say, thus no use trying change anything. -
can acknowledge change extremely hard impossible, circumstances


can change, yet striving better human beings still worthwhile
endeavor. correct? - Absolutely. simply knowledge, either
experience making end right neurobiology class taught
change can happen within framework mechanistic neurobiology.
now open made optimistic good news world around you.
likely inspired that, resistant getting
discouraged bad news, simply now understand possible. - Mm-hmm,
yeah, somebody spent much career working hippocampus,
assume believer neuroplasticity, neural circuits can change
response experience, so-called top-down mechanisms
prefrontal cortex talking can play role there,
decision try change pursuit knowledge pursuit experience
can shape circuitry, therefore make us different machines, speak. - Yeah.
not can say prenatal hormone exposure changed way brain
constructed, learning prenatal hormone exposure can change construction
brain will change brain right now, think
intentions came from. Wow, maybe something it. knowledge
knowledge effector itself. - important powerful
statement hear. think many people think tool, doesn't involve pill
protocol, useless. certainly pills protocols
useful variety context variety things, idea knowledge itself,
whereas put it, knowledge knowledge tool, think important
concept people embed minds. And, listen, grateful discussion
raising topics. think people, many people know work
testosterone, stress, covered today, work freewill
idea hopeless total control. think realizing
listening neither true, solution resides

01:23:44 Robert’s New Book: “Determined: Science Life Without Free Will”

understanding freewill lack it, [laughs] also neuroplasticity.
working book freewill, willing tell us little bit
book process can look forward to? - Yeah,
going really slow. Title is, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill."


essentially first half book trying convince reader, okay, not
no freewill whatsoever, least lot less normally assumed.
going standard arguments freewill, doesn't make sense
21st century science? led reading lot frustrating
philosophers basically willing admit stuff made like atoms
molecules. like physical reality sort world, not just relying
magic, believe freewill magical reasons, doesn't make
sense. Okay, first half book hopefully convince people
much less freewill used think. second half gigantic
juncture built around fact haven't thought freewill since like
adolescent. despite thinking way, still absolutely no idea
supposed function belief. supposed go everyday life
anything feel entitled isn't true? angers hatreds feel aren't justified,
no thing appropriate, blame punishment praise reward,
none makes sense, somebody like even compliments haircut,
conditioned say, oh, thanks, something do.
supposed function that? second half wrestling that,
punchline is, going incredibly hard. think going
hard subtract notion freewill making sense like serial murderers,
going thousand times harder making sense somebody says "good job"
you. [Andrew laughs] exact reality sort
interpretations. going incredibly hard, nonetheless look
history subtracted notion agency sorts realms
blame, starting thinking witches caused hailstorms 500 years ago notion
psychodynamically screwed mothers cause schizophrenia, done it.
done endless number times, able subtract sense volition
understanding world works around us. don't murderers running
amuck street, society hasn't collapsed puddle, fact,
humane society. good news possible done repeatedly
past, going hard hell. hard hell try write
coherently, [laughs] discovering, going slowly. - Well, speak many, many
people say really excited book done will
patiently wait, great excitement book, "Determined". said title,
correct? - Yeah, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill". seems like


can't publish book days without sub-title, it? - Fantastic. Well,
excited read book. grateful conversation today, learned
ton. Every time speak learn, really pleasure delight

like reveling sort sense predictability, soon going be, oh.
going sitting two minutes saying, damn, comes. Predictive
information works narrow domain. Similarly, control. want
sense control face stress? answer is, mild moderate
stressor happening then, sense control completely
independent reality whether control not, face mild
moderate stressors, sense control gets interpreted as, wow, look much worse
things been. Thank God, control, top master fate.
contrast, major stressor, arbitrary sense control make
think, oh God, look much better been. prevented it.
know intuitively like face people's worst stressors.
Nobody stopped car way kids suddenly jumped out. wouldn't
mattered gotten doctor month ago, instead now,
wouldn't made any... didn't actually control. see is,
absolutely want huge sense control mild moderate stressors,
especially ones result good outcome. Hooray, me, face horrible
stressors, want like self-deception, like truth beauty don't
necessarily go hand-in-hand point. stress management techniques
impact control predictability wind far worse neutral preaching
somebody homeless somebody terminal cancer, somebody
refugee. Tell neurotic middle-class person psychological tools
turn hell heaven. truth that. thing somebody
going real hell, just privileged heartlessness
doesn't work. outlets, outlets damaging,
not good way mitigate stress. Social support, confusing mere
acquaintances real social support, going rug pulled
point. mistaking social support being, going bitching
moaning demanding supportiveness everyone around rather
reciprocally, not going work well either. not simple.
not nothing lots us really lousy. It, like good friends things
like that, takes lot work right? wrong may
temporarily seem like great thing, turns completely misplaced
faith, going feeling worse started.



00:51:35 Best Buffer Stress

- Interesting. days, lot interest using physical practices mitigate
stress, trying get ruminating, extent take control neural
circuits brain using exercise using breathing hypnosis. And, course,
hypnosis mental component well. thoughts stress mitigation
standpoint of, okay, don't want rat number two, want select
something ourselves, take initiative ourselves. forced
exercising not, actually negative health effect perhaps. need
pick something like, need take control it. terms supporting
people, touched bit. best way support people?
talk stressful thing? mean, not asking play psychologist here,
find divergent data this. can spin lather ruminating
something. language seems like wonderful tool, also fairly
deprived tool doesn't really get core physiology like something
like breathing would. thoughts more, lack better way put
it, head-centered, cognitive approaches stress mitigation versus kind going
core physiology. Cold showers now even thing extent just get
people stress acclimated, voluntarily taking cold showers. - makes sense
physiologically, preconditioning real stressors come. terms
bring up, oh, transcendental meditation, mindfulness, exercise, prayer, sort reflecting
gratitude, sort thing. Collectively work average, work
terms of, can lower heart rate cholesterol levels sorts good
outcomes, compromise us. One exactly caveat comes
running wheel study is, doesn't matter many friends swear stress
management technique. makes want scream head off 10
seconds, not one going work you. read fine print
testimonials, got something works you. Another one stress
management type techniques work, can't save weekend, can't
save stuck hold phone Muzak two minutes.
got something stop virtually, daily every
day, spend 20, 30 minutes it. see coming
like 80/20 rule economics. 80/20, 80% complaints store come
20% customers, things like that. see is, entire life consists


every single thing shoulders, can't say no 24/7. stopped
finally said, wellbeing important enough finally get say no
stuff can't say no to. going every day 20 minutes,
whatever stress management technique 20 minutes sort
knows what, already 80% way simply decided
wellbeing important enough going stop every single day
priority. exactly finding find people chronic
depression untreated merely calling getting appointment see mental
health professional, people start feeling better already evidence
activated, matter enough this, conceive
actually good outcome rather hopeless one. Just something
meditative reflective every day so, hardly even matters one
doing. comes thus another warning, not trust anybody
says, scientifically proven brand stress management works
better ones. Just watch wallet point. - Yeah, amen. think one
core goals lab David Spiegel's lab, know worked
David published papers David well really try find
various entry points thing call autonomic nervous system
stress system, systems gone unchecked really can take us
dark path. idea many entry points really one keeps,
data keep telling us again. no magic breathing tool
exercise, variety one those. And, again, come back idea
one select one make space for, one
hopefully enjoy going work best terms physiology. - [mumbles]
benign people stuck around you.

00:57:04 Power Perception, Choice & Individual Differences

- Right, right, absolutely. brings question of, find amazing
perceive event, whether not chose event not can
incredible different effects circuitry brain circuitry body
biology cells. ways boggles mind, like can decision made
presumably prefrontal cortex, although parts brain well, can
change essentially polarity response body. And, mean, talked


Type personalities there. don't go detail
sake time, interesting effects endothelial cells. mean, literally
size of, [laughs] portals blood opposite direction, depending
whether not somebody wants situation highly motivated person. Maybe
just give us top contour think really illustrates
principle beautifully. maybe would, just speculate
brain might switch turn one experience terrible beneficial
beneficial terrible, really fascinating. - Well, need like tonight
going sleep lying bed nice drowsy
heart's beating nice slow, start thinking fact heart isn't going
beat forever. [Andrew laughs] imagine toes getting cold afterward
imagine flow blood coming halt clotting. going
something physiology point 99% mammals
running frantically. going turning sympathetic
stress response thought, emotions, memory. measure
just much cortex limbic system sends projections
autonomic regulators brain. can think autonomic regulatory neurons
action ways animals can like extremes environmental
circumstances. given autonomic rule, mean, big challenge
understanding gigantic individual differences. that's, talk
optimal amount stress, counts stimulation, general stress not
severe doesn't go long overall benevolence setting.
conditions, love stressed something unexpected
control predictability like really interesting plot turn movie watching.
great, get individual differences somehow accommodate
fact people, perfect stimulatory amount stress like getting
early Audubon birdwatching walk next Sunday morning. somebody else,
signing like mercenary Yemen. [Andrew laughs]

01:00:32 Context-Setting, Prefrontal Cortex & Hierarchy

tremendous individual differences swamp simple prescriptions. - Yeah,
prefrontal cortex, thinking machinery harbor, double-edged
sword. remarkable is, areas brain like hypothalamus


amygdala, sort like switches. mean, context gain
control. talked gain control testosterone, etc., really like
switches. mean, stimulate ventromedial hypothalamus, get right neurons,
animal will try kill even object sitting next it. tickle
neurons, it'll try mate object. mean, really wild. think
probably rules prefrontal cortex also, sounds like context plural
prefrontal cortex can draw probably infinite, probably learn
perceive threat anything. Whether not another group whether not
science whether not somebody's version shape earth versus
another. mean, like, can plug anything system give enough data,
think sounds like drive fear response love response.
overstepping? - [laughs] mixed horribly ambivalent one changing
millisecond, like mutually contradictory. No, absolutely case
prefrontal cortex, regretted like wasted 30 years
life studying hippocampus shoot studied prefrontal cortex
much interesting does, contextual stuff.
ways not okay lie setting, great thing another.
not okay kill unless them, get medal. not,
social context moral relativity situational ethic stuff, prefrontal cortex
got master that. winds meaning place brain
anywhere say perception things can powerfully influence
reality coming you. - Yeah. - mean, great example, just harking back
testosterone. Okay, exercise boosts testosterone levels. exercise
success exercise failure? literature back 80s looking
outcomes marathons. testosterone rise people win
losers? Wrestling matches. Things sort simple prediction answer
wound being, didn't see simple answer. Okay, win marathon, not
necessarily predictor increased testosterone. about? find
like winner testosterone decreases, find guy came 73rd
massive testosterone increase. Whoa, about?
far human subtlety. guy won race decline testosterone
came three minutes later really, really expecting.
everybody now going writing hill. guy
came 73rd boost testosterone assuming dead


heart attack third mile, [Andrew laughs] instead managed finish.
interpretive stuff going there, prefrontal cortex about. -
Amazing, raises question cognitive flexibility, Can tell
something good us even not enjoying it? can wriggle around
corners choosing exercise the... Personally not big fan long bouts
meditation, benefited tremendously things like dedicated breathing
shorter rounds meditation. Can tell good wriggle around
corner get physiology working way want? cognitive
flexibility? Can third place runner tell myself, well, least came in,
wanted win badly. primary goal, another goal beat
previous time, that. so, [laughs] mean, it's... extent can
toggle relationship prefrontal cortex primitive
systems? - Well, enormous amount. example, low hierarchy
generally bad health like every mammal there, including us,
something special, can part multiple hierarchies time.
maybe low ranking one them, extremely high ranking
another, like crappiest job corporation, captain
softball team year company. better bet somebody
going find sorts ways decide nine five Monday Fridays, just stupid
paying bills. really matters prestige weekend. poorer,
deacon church here. can play sorts psychological
games that. One like consistent, reliable ones need
use frontal cortex like crazy is, somebody something rotten need
attribute it. answer is, something wrong, hmm, rotten.
Always always will constitutional explanation. something
rotten somebody, explain afterward? situational one. tired,
stressed sort setting, misunderstood this. best excusing
bad things access inner lives got
prefrontal cortexes great coming situational explanation rather than,
hey, maybe just like selfish rotten human, need change.
prefrontal cortex, every time, don't let somebody merge lane
front us, even though curse somebody thing and...
Endlessly. - love it. statement fact can select multiple
hierarchies participate in. seems like particularly important one nowadays


social media prevalent. know not particularly active social
media although might pleasantly, don't know unpleasantly surprised find
lot positive discussion work, don't even
need there. just continue discuss [laughs] work.
interesting social media found context very, broad. mean,
one argue one selects follow news articles reading,
etc. can create kind funneling information can dangerous.
verification crazy ideas even just less exposure new ideas. also
idea social media incredibly broad context. scroll feed,
no longer like eighth grade classroom office faculty
meeting. exposed thousands, not millions contexts, meal,
soccer game, person's body, person's intellect. YouTube another example.
vast, vast landscape. context completely mishmash whereas assuming
evolved. think evolve contexts much constrained.
interacted limited number individuals limited number different domains,
seasons tended constrain us all. course, got phones televisions,
started expand, now ever, brain, prefrontal cortex
sense exist multiple hierarchies essentially wicked
infinity. think might interacting primitive
systems aspects biology? - Well, think get is, ways
punchline of, human humans, use
exact blueprint, hormones, kinases, receptors,
same, everything built exact stuff species
there, go use completely novel way. usually terms
able abstract stuff space time dramatic ways. So, okay, low
ranking baboon can feel badly just like killed rabbit
eat higher ranking guy boots off takes away you,
feel crummy stressful unhappy. exact
things like brain bodies losing sense self-esteem,
can watching movie character screen feeling inadequate compared
like wonderful attractive are. can somebody driving past us
expensive car, don't even see face, can feel belittled
socioeconomic status. can watch like Lifestyles Rich Famous
read Bezos to. reason, decide life less fulfilling


didn't fly space 11 minutes. can feel miserable
ways no organism can, simply can
meaningful social networks include like party reading Facebook
weren't invited taking place Singapore, don't know
people, nonetheless, somehow means

01:11:20 Dr. Sapolsky Accomplishes Deep Thinking

feel less content turned be. take steps life
actively restrict contexts think live contemplate order
enhance creative life, intellectual life? steps actively take? -
Well, actively don't know make use anything [laughs] social media.
guess counts thus actively chosen not learn how.
case certainly last year half, like lots people, gone stretches
managed sort enforce moratorium looking news,
wonderfully freeing. think larger sense though, addition
neurobiologist, sort spent decades spending part year studying wild
baboons national park East Africa. spend three months year without
electricity, without phone calls, going 12 hours day without saying word
somebody. finally would, somebody nomadic pastoralist guy
different language. Yeah, 90% like insightful thinking anything
laboratory three months year, not one lab, not
inundated stuff. - Well, think shifting trend towards trying create
narrowing context that... like see, niece, 14-years-old
friends good putting phones away. say, not
going phones interaction, especially after... realized still
somewhat this. unclear headed,

01:13:17 Free Will?

2020 restrictive separated friends. Now it's,
really focus together not bring elements phones.
brings great hope generation, [laughs] maybe will...
knows, maybe run off study baboons, need field researchers.


along lines choice, like shift gears slightly talk freewill,
ability make choices all. - Well, personal way left field inflammatory
stance is, don't think shred freewill despite 95% philosophers.
think probably majority neuroscientists saying freewill least
circumstances. don't think all. reason is,
something, behave, make choice, whatever. understand
that, intention come from? Part due like sensory
environment previous minute. hormone levels
bloodstream morning. whether wonderful
stressful last three months sort neuroplasticity happened. Part
hormone levels exposed fetus. Part culture ancestors
came with, thus parented kid.
there, can understand behavior coming without incorporating
those. point, not relevant factors,
ultimately one factor. talking evolution
behavior, definition also talking genetics. talking
genes behavior, definition talking brain
constructed proteins coded for. talking like mood
disorder now, talking sense efficacy getting five-year-
old. intertwined. look influences, basically like
challenge is, show neuron just caused behavior, show network
neurons just caused behavior. show nothing just
influenced anything sensory environment one second ago
evolution species. no space fit freewill concept
winds brain, not brain. simply no wiggle room
there. - can appreciate behaviors choices consequences
long line dominoes fell prior behavior. possible can
intervene domino effect, speak. words, can recognition
fact genes heritability, epigenome that, hormonal context,
historical context. Can knowledge give small shard
freewill? Meaning, allow say, ah, okay, accept choices
somewhat predetermined, yet knowing gives additional layer
control? philosophical biological universe works? - Nah.
can produce wonderfully positive belief change can happen. Even


traumatic change, even worst circumstances, unlikely people, change
can happen, things can change. Don't fatalistic, don't decide
mechanistic, biological machines nothing can ever... Change can happen,
people go off rails translating into, can change ourselves. don't,
can't no freewill. However, can changed circumstance.
point is, like look Aplysia, sea slug learned retract gill

it, learned, behavior changed environment. hear
news something like horrifically depressing going on, refugees wherever.
result, feel little bit helpless less sense efficacy

heart attack third mile, [Andrew laughs] instead managed finish.
interpretive stuff going there, prefrontal cortex about. -
Amazing, raises question cognitive flexibility, Can tell
something good us even not enjoying it? can wriggle around
corners choosing exercise the... Personally not big fan long bouts
meditation, benefited tremendously things like dedicated breathing
shorter rounds meditation. Can tell good wriggle around
corner get physiology working way want? cognitive
flexibility? Can third place runner tell myself, well, least came in,
wanted win badly. primary goal, another goal beat
previous time, that. so, [laughs] mean, it's... extent can
toggle relationship prefrontal cortex primitive
systems? - Well, enormous amount. example, low hierarchy
generally bad health like every mammal there, including us,
something special, can part multiple hierarchies time.
maybe low ranking one them, extremely high ranking
another, like crappiest job corporation, captain
softball team year company. better bet somebody
going find sorts ways decide nine five Monday Fridays, just stupid
paying bills. really matters prestige weekend. poorer,
deacon church here. can play sorts psychological
games that. One like consistent, reliable ones need
use frontal cortex like crazy is, somebody something rotten need
attribute it. answer is, something wrong, hmm, rotten.
Always always will constitutional explanation. something
rotten somebody, explain afterward? situational one. tired,
stressed sort setting, misunderstood this. best excusing
bad things access inner lives got
prefrontal cortexes great coming situational explanation rather than,
hey, maybe just like selfish rotten human, need change.
prefrontal cortex, every time, don't let somebody merge lane
front us, even though curse somebody thing and...
Endlessly. - love it. statement fact can select multiple
hierarchies participate in. seems like particularly important one nowadays


social media prevalent. know not particularly active social
media although might pleasantly, don't know unpleasantly surprised find
lot positive discussion work, don't even
need there. just continue discuss [laughs] work.
interesting social media found context very, broad. mean,
one argue one selects follow news articles reading,
etc. can create kind funneling information can dangerous.
verification crazy ideas even just less exposure new ideas. also
idea social media incredibly broad context. scroll feed,
no longer like eighth grade classroom office faculty
meeting. exposed thousands, not millions contexts, meal,
soccer game, person's body, person's intellect. YouTube another example.
vast, vast landscape. context completely mishmash whereas assuming
evolved. think evolve contexts much constrained.
interacted limited number individuals limited number different domains,
seasons tended constrain us all. course, got phones televisions,
started expand, now ever, brain, prefrontal cortex
sense exist multiple hierarchies essentially wicked
infinity. think might interacting primitive
systems aspects biology? - Well, think get is, ways
punchline of, human humans, use
exact blueprint, hormones, kinases, receptors,
same, everything built exact stuff species
there, go use completely novel way. usually terms
able abstract stuff space time dramatic ways. So, okay, low
ranking baboon can feel badly just like killed rabbit
eat higher ranking guy boots off takes away you,
feel crummy stressful unhappy. exact
things like brain bodies losing sense self-esteem,
can watching movie character screen feeling inadequate compared
like wonderful attractive are. can somebody driving past us
expensive car, don't even see face, can feel belittled
socioeconomic status. can watch like Lifestyles Rich Famous
read Bezos to. reason, decide life less fulfilling


didn't fly space 11 minutes. can feel miserable
ways no organism can, simply can
meaningful social networks include like party reading Facebook
weren't invited taking place Singapore, don't know
people, nonetheless, somehow means

01:11:20 Dr. Sapolsky Accomplishes Deep Thinking

feel less content turned be. take steps life
actively restrict contexts think live contemplate order
enhance creative life, intellectual life? steps actively take? -
Well, actively don't know make use anything [laughs] social media.
guess counts thus actively chosen not learn how.
case certainly last year half, like lots people, gone stretches
managed sort enforce moratorium looking news,
wonderfully freeing. think larger sense though, addition
neurobiologist, sort spent decades spending part year studying wild
baboons national park East Africa. spend three months year without
electricity, without phone calls, going 12 hours day without saying word
somebody. finally would, somebody nomadic pastoralist guy
different language. Yeah, 90% like insightful thinking anything
laboratory three months year, not one lab, not
inundated stuff. - Well, think shifting trend towards trying create
narrowing context that... like see, niece, 14-years-old
friends good putting phones away. say, not
going phones interaction, especially after... realized still
somewhat this. unclear headed,

01:13:17 Free Will?

2020 restrictive separated friends. Now it's,
really focus together not bring elements phones.
brings great hope generation, [laughs] maybe will...
knows, maybe run off study baboons, need field researchers.


along lines choice, like shift gears slightly talk freewill,
ability make choices all. - Well, personal way left field inflammatory
stance is, don't think shred freewill despite 95% philosophers.
think probably majority neuroscientists saying freewill least
circumstances. don't think all. reason is,
something, behave, make choice, whatever. understand
that, intention come from? Part due like sensory
environment previous minute. hormone levels
bloodstream morning. whether wonderful
stressful last three months sort neuroplasticity happened. Part
hormone levels exposed fetus. Part culture ancestors
came with, thus parented kid.
there, can understand behavior coming without incorporating
those. point, not relevant factors,
ultimately one factor. talking evolution
behavior, definition also talking genetics. talking
genes behavior, definition talking brain
constructed proteins coded for. talking like mood
disorder now, talking sense efficacy getting five-year-
old. intertwined. look influences, basically like
challenge is, show neuron just caused behavior, show network
neurons just caused behavior. show nothing just
influenced anything sensory environment one second ago
evolution species. no space fit freewill concept
winds brain, not brain. simply no wiggle room
there. - can appreciate behaviors choices consequences
long line dominoes fell prior behavior. possible can
intervene domino effect, speak. words, can recognition
fact genes heritability, epigenome that, hormonal context,
historical context. Can knowledge give small shard
freewill? Meaning, allow say, ah, okay, accept choices
somewhat predetermined, yet knowing gives additional layer
control? philosophical biological universe works? - Nah.
can produce wonderfully positive belief change can happen. Even


traumatic change, even worst circumstances, unlikely people, change
can happen, things can change. Don't fatalistic, don't decide
mechanistic, biological machines nothing can ever... Change can happen,
people go off rails translating into, can change ourselves. don't,
can't no freewill. However, can changed circumstance.
point is, like look Aplysia, sea slug learned retract gill
response shock tail, can like conditioning, Pavlovian conditioning
it, learned, behavior changed environment. hear
news something like horrifically depressing going on, refugees wherever.
result, feel little bit helpless less sense efficacy
world, behaviors changed. Okay, okay, yeah, guess that,
remarkable thing is, exact neurobiology. signal transduction
pathways happening sea snail incorporate exact kinases
proteases phosphatases mammalian fear
conditioning, alert, conserved. exact thing, simply
playing obviously much, much fancier domain. learned
change possible despite understanding mechanistically can't change
volitionally, understand change possible, just
changed ability brain respond optimistic stimuli. changed
ability brain now send direction exposed
information will seem cheerful rather depressing. Oh God, amazing,
Nelson Mandela Martin Luther king folks did. Wow,
adverse circumstances, able do. Maybe can also, maybe can go
read people like get even data points change
neurochemistry, responses different now. tilted little bit
direction feeling like can make difference instead damn
hopeless. enormous change can happen, last thing come
view of, nothing less sum biology interactions
environment,

01:20:50 Apply Knowledge & Learning

throw hands say, thus no use trying change anything. -
can acknowledge change extremely hard impossible, circumstances


can change, yet striving better human beings still worthwhile
endeavor. correct? - Absolutely. simply knowledge, either
experience making end right neurobiology class taught
change can happen within framework mechanistic neurobiology.
now open made optimistic good news world around you.
likely inspired that, resistant getting
discouraged bad news, simply now understand possible. - Mm-hmm,
yeah, somebody spent much career working hippocampus,
assume believer neuroplasticity, neural circuits can change
response experience, so-called top-down mechanisms
prefrontal cortex talking can play role there,
decision try change pursuit knowledge pursuit experience
can shape circuitry, therefore make us different machines, speak. - Yeah.
not can say prenatal hormone exposure changed way brain
constructed, learning prenatal hormone exposure can change construction
brain will change brain right now, think
intentions came from. Wow, maybe something it. knowledge
knowledge effector itself. - important powerful
statement hear. think many people think tool, doesn't involve pill
protocol, useless. certainly pills protocols
useful variety context variety things, idea knowledge itself,
whereas put it, knowledge knowledge tool, think important

01:23:44 Robert’s New Book: “Determined: Science Life Without Free Will”

understanding freewill lack it, [laughs] also neuroplasticity.
working book freewill, willing tell us little bit
book process can look forward to? - Yeah,
going really slow. Title is, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill."


essentially first half book trying convince reader, okay, not
no freewill whatsoever, least lot less normally assumed.
going standard arguments freewill, doesn't make sense
21st century science? led reading lot frustrating
philosophers basically willing admit stuff made like atoms
molecules. like physical reality sort world, not just relying
magic, believe freewill magical reasons, doesn't make
sense. Okay, first half book hopefully convince people
much less freewill used think. second half gigantic
juncture built around fact haven't thought freewill since like
adolescent. despite thinking way, still absolutely no idea
supposed function belief. supposed go everyday life
anything feel entitled isn't true? angers hatreds feel aren't justified,
no thing appropriate, blame punishment praise reward,
none makes sense, somebody like even compliments haircut,
conditioned say, oh, thanks, something do.
supposed function that? second half wrestling that,
punchline is, going incredibly hard. think going
hard subtract notion freewill making sense like serial murderers,
going thousand times harder making sense somebody says "good job"
you. [Andrew laughs] exact reality sort
interpretations. going incredibly hard, nonetheless look
history subtracted notion agency sorts realms
blame, starting thinking witches caused hailstorms 500 years ago notion
psychodynamically screwed mothers cause schizophrenia, done it.
done endless number times, able subtract sense volition
understanding world works around us. don't murderers running
amuck street, society hasn't collapsed puddle, fact,
humane society. good news possible done repeatedly
past, going hard hell. hard hell try write
coherently, [laughs] discovering, going slowly. - Well, speak many, many
people say really excited book done will
patiently wait, great excitement book, "Determined". said title,
correct? - Yeah, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill". seems like


can't publish book days without sub-title, it? - Fantastic. Well,
excited read book. grateful conversation today, learned
ton. Every time speak learn, really pleasure delight

every single thing shoulders, can't say no 24/7. stopped
finally said, wellbeing important enough finally get say no
stuff can't say no to. going every day 20 minutes,
whatever stress management technique 20 minutes sort
knows what, already 80% way simply decided
wellbeing important enough going stop every single day
priority. exactly finding find people chronic
depression untreated merely calling getting appointment see mental
health professional, people start feeling better already evidence
activated, matter enough this, conceive
actually good outcome rather hopeless one. Just something
meditative reflective every day so, hardly even matters one
doing. comes thus another warning, not trust anybody
says, scientifically proven brand stress management works
better ones. Just watch wallet point. - Yeah, amen. think one
core goals lab David Spiegel's lab, know worked
David published papers David well really try find
various entry points thing call autonomic nervous system
stress system, systems gone unchecked really can take us
dark path. idea many entry points really one keeps,
data keep telling us again. no magic breathing tool
exercise, variety one those. And, again, come back idea
one select one make space for, one
hopefully enjoy going work best terms physiology. - [mumbles]
benign people stuck around you.

00:57:04 Power Perception, Choice & Individual Differences

- Right, right, absolutely. brings question of, find amazing
perceive event, whether not chose event not can
incredible different effects circuitry brain circuitry body
biology cells. ways boggles mind, like can decision made
presumably prefrontal cortex, although parts brain well, can
change essentially polarity response body. And, mean, talked


Type personalities there. don't go detail
sake time, interesting effects endothelial cells. mean, literally
size of, [laughs] portals blood opposite direction, depending
whether not somebody wants situation highly motivated person. Maybe
just give us top contour think really illustrates
principle beautifully. maybe would, just speculate
brain might switch turn one experience terrible beneficial
beneficial terrible, really fascinating. - Well, need like tonight
going sleep lying bed nice drowsy
heart's beating nice slow, start thinking fact heart isn't going
beat forever. [Andrew laughs] imagine toes getting cold afterward
imagine flow blood coming halt clotting. going
something physiology point 99% mammals
running frantically. going turning sympathetic
stress response thought, emotions, memory. measure
just much cortex limbic system sends projections
autonomic regulators brain. can think autonomic regulatory neurons
action ways animals can like extremes environmental
circumstances. given autonomic rule, mean, big challenge
understanding gigantic individual differences. that's, talk
optimal amount stress, counts stimulation, general stress not
severe doesn't go long overall benevolence setting.
conditions, love stressed something unexpected
control predictability like really interesting plot turn movie watching.
great, get individual differences somehow accommodate

01:00:32 Context-Setting, Prefrontal Cortex & Hierarchy

tremendous individual differences swamp simple prescriptions. - Yeah,
prefrontal cortex, thinking machinery harbor, double-edged
sword. remarkable is, areas brain like hypothalamus


amygdala, sort like switches. mean, context gain
control. talked gain control testosterone, etc., really like
switches. mean, stimulate ventromedial hypothalamus, get right neurons,
animal will try kill even object sitting next it. tickle
neurons, it'll try mate object. mean, really wild. think
probably rules prefrontal cortex also, sounds like context plural
prefrontal cortex can draw probably infinite, probably learn
perceive threat anything. Whether not another group whether not
science whether not somebody's version shape earth versus

think sounds like drive fear response love response.
overstepping? - [laughs] mixed horribly ambivalent one changing
millisecond, like mutually contradictory. No, absolutely case
prefrontal cortex, regretted like wasted 30 years
life studying hippocampus shoot studied prefrontal cortex

overstepping? - [laughs] mixed horribly ambivalent one changing
millisecond, like mutually contradictory. No, absolutely case
prefrontal cortex, regretted like wasted 30 years
life studying hippocampus shoot studied prefrontal cortex
much interesting does, contextual stuff.
ways not okay lie setting, great thing another.
not okay kill unless them, get medal. not,
social context moral relativity situational ethic stuff, prefrontal cortex
got master that. winds meaning place brain
anywhere say perception things can powerfully influence
reality coming you. - Yeah. - mean, great example, just harking back
testosterone. Okay, exercise boosts testosterone levels. exercise
success exercise failure? literature back 80s looking
outcomes marathons. testosterone rise people win
losers? Wrestling matches. Things sort simple prediction answer
wound being, didn't see simple answer. Okay, win marathon, not
necessarily predictor increased testosterone. about? find
like winner testosterone decreases, find guy came 73rd
massive testosterone increase. Whoa, about?
far human subtlety. guy won race decline testosterone
came three minutes later really, really expecting.
everybody now going writing hill. guy
came 73rd boost testosterone assuming dead


heart attack third mile, [Andrew laughs] instead managed finish.
interpretive stuff going there, prefrontal cortex about. -
Amazing, raises question cognitive flexibility, Can tell
something good us even not enjoying it? can wriggle around
corners choosing exercise the... Personally not big fan long bouts
meditation, benefited tremendously things like dedicated breathing
shorter rounds meditation. Can tell good wriggle around
corner get physiology working way want? cognitive
flexibility? Can third place runner tell myself, well, least came in,
wanted win badly. primary goal, another goal beat
previous time, that. so, [laughs] mean, it's... extent can
toggle relationship prefrontal cortex primitive
systems? - Well, enormous amount. example, low hierarchy
generally bad health like every mammal there, including us,
something special, can part multiple hierarchies time.
maybe low ranking one them, extremely high ranking
another, like crappiest job corporation, captain
softball team year company. better bet somebody
going find sorts ways decide nine five Monday Fridays, just stupid
paying bills. really matters prestige weekend. poorer,
deacon church here. can play sorts psychological
games that. One like consistent, reliable ones need
use frontal cortex like crazy is, somebody something rotten need
attribute it. answer is, something wrong, hmm, rotten.
Always always will constitutional explanation. something
rotten somebody, explain afterward? situational one. tired,
stressed sort setting, misunderstood this. best excusing
bad things access inner lives got
prefrontal cortexes great coming situational explanation rather than,
hey, maybe just like selfish rotten human, need change.
prefrontal cortex, every time, don't let somebody merge lane
front us, even though curse somebody thing and...
Endlessly. - love it. statement fact can select multiple
hierarchies participate in. seems like particularly important one nowadays


social media prevalent. know not particularly active social
media although might pleasantly, don't know unpleasantly surprised find
lot positive discussion work, don't even
need there. just continue discuss [laughs] work.
interesting social media found context very, broad. mean,
one argue one selects follow news articles reading,
etc. can create kind funneling information can dangerous.
verification crazy ideas even just less exposure new ideas. also
idea social media incredibly broad context. scroll feed,
no longer like eighth grade classroom office faculty
meeting. exposed thousands, not millions contexts, meal,
soccer game, person's body, person's intellect. YouTube another example.
vast, vast landscape. context completely mishmash whereas assuming
evolved. think evolve contexts much constrained.
interacted limited number individuals limited number different domains,
seasons tended constrain us all. course, got phones televisions,
started expand, now ever, brain, prefrontal cortex
sense exist multiple hierarchies essentially wicked
infinity. think might interacting primitive
systems aspects biology? - Well, think get is, ways
punchline of, human humans, use
exact blueprint, hormones, kinases, receptors,
same, everything built exact stuff species
there, go use completely novel way. usually terms
able abstract stuff space time dramatic ways. So, okay, low
ranking baboon can feel badly just like killed rabbit
eat higher ranking guy boots off takes away you,
feel crummy stressful unhappy. exact
things like brain bodies losing sense self-esteem,
can watching movie character screen feeling inadequate compared
like wonderful attractive are. can somebody driving past us
expensive car, don't even see face, can feel belittled
socioeconomic status. can watch like Lifestyles Rich Famous
read Bezos to. reason, decide life less fulfilling


didn't fly space 11 minutes. can feel miserable
ways no organism can, simply can
meaningful social networks include like party reading Facebook
weren't invited taking place Singapore, don't know
people, nonetheless, somehow means

01:11:20 Dr. Sapolsky Accomplishes Deep Thinking

feel less content turned be. take steps life
actively restrict contexts think live contemplate order
enhance creative life, intellectual life? steps actively take? -
Well, actively don't know make use anything [laughs] social media.
guess counts thus actively chosen not learn how.
case certainly last year half, like lots people, gone stretches
managed sort enforce moratorium looking news,
wonderfully freeing. think larger sense though, addition
neurobiologist, sort spent decades spending part year studying wild
baboons national park East Africa. spend three months year without
electricity, without phone calls, going 12 hours day without saying word
somebody. finally would, somebody nomadic pastoralist guy
different language. Yeah, 90% like insightful thinking anything
laboratory three months year, not one lab, not
inundated stuff. - Well, think shifting trend towards trying create
narrowing context that... like see, niece, 14-years-old
friends good putting phones away. say, not
going phones interaction, especially after... realized still
somewhat this. unclear headed,

01:13:17 Free Will?

2020 restrictive separated friends. Now it's,
really focus together not bring elements phones.
brings great hope generation, [laughs] maybe will...
knows, maybe run off study baboons, need field researchers.


along lines choice, like shift gears slightly talk freewill,
ability make choices all. - Well, personal way left field inflammatory
stance is, don't think shred freewill despite 95% philosophers.
think probably majority neuroscientists saying freewill least
circumstances. don't think all. reason is,
something, behave, make choice, whatever. understand
that, intention come from? Part due like sensory
environment previous minute. hormone levels
bloodstream morning. whether wonderful
stressful last three months sort neuroplasticity happened. Part
hormone levels exposed fetus. Part culture ancestors
came with, thus parented kid.
there, can understand behavior coming without incorporating
those. point, not relevant factors,
ultimately one factor. talking evolution
behavior, definition also talking genetics. talking
genes behavior, definition talking brain
constructed proteins coded for. talking like mood
disorder now, talking sense efficacy getting five-year-
old. intertwined. look influences, basically like
challenge is, show neuron just caused behavior, show network
neurons just caused behavior. show nothing just
influenced anything sensory environment one second ago
evolution species. no space fit freewill concept
winds brain, not brain. simply no wiggle room
there. - can appreciate behaviors choices consequences
long line dominoes fell prior behavior. possible can
intervene domino effect, speak. words, can recognition
fact genes heritability, epigenome that, hormonal context,
historical context. Can knowledge give small shard
freewill? Meaning, allow say, ah, okay, accept choices
somewhat predetermined, yet knowing gives additional layer
control? philosophical biological universe works? - Nah.
can produce wonderfully positive belief change can happen. Even


traumatic change, even worst circumstances, unlikely people, change
can happen, things can change. Don't fatalistic, don't decide
mechanistic, biological machines nothing can ever... Change can happen,
people go off rails translating into, can change ourselves. don't,
can't no freewill. However, can changed circumstance.
point is, like look Aplysia, sea slug learned retract gill
response shock tail, can like conditioning, Pavlovian conditioning
it, learned, behavior changed environment. hear
news something like horrifically depressing going on, refugees wherever.
result, feel little bit helpless less sense efficacy
world, behaviors changed. Okay, okay, yeah, guess that,
remarkable thing is, exact neurobiology. signal transduction
pathways happening sea snail incorporate exact kinases
proteases phosphatases mammalian fear
conditioning, alert, conserved. exact thing, simply
playing obviously much, much fancier domain. learned
change possible despite understanding mechanistically can't change
volitionally, understand change possible, just
changed ability brain respond optimistic stimuli. changed
ability brain now send direction exposed
information will seem cheerful rather depressing. Oh God, amazing,
Nelson Mandela Martin Luther king folks did. Wow,
adverse circumstances, able do. Maybe can also, maybe can go
read people like get even data points change
neurochemistry, responses different now. tilted little bit
direction feeling like can make difference instead damn
hopeless. enormous change can happen, last thing come
view of, nothing less sum biology interactions
environment,

01:20:50 Apply Knowledge & Learning

throw hands say, thus no use trying change anything. -
can acknowledge change extremely hard impossible, circumstances


can change, yet striving better human beings still worthwhile
endeavor. correct? - Absolutely. simply knowledge, either
experience making end right neurobiology class taught
change can happen within framework mechanistic neurobiology.
now open made optimistic good news world around you.
likely inspired that, resistant getting
discouraged bad news, simply now understand possible. - Mm-hmm,
yeah, somebody spent much career working hippocampus,
assume believer neuroplasticity, neural circuits can change
response experience, so-called top-down mechanisms
prefrontal cortex talking can play role there,
decision try change pursuit knowledge pursuit experience
can shape circuitry, therefore make us different machines, speak. - Yeah.
not can say prenatal hormone exposure changed way brain
constructed, learning prenatal hormone exposure can change construction
brain will change brain right now, think
intentions came from. Wow, maybe something it. knowledge
knowledge effector itself. - important powerful
statement hear. think many people think tool, doesn't involve pill
protocol, useless. certainly pills protocols
useful variety context variety things, idea knowledge itself,
whereas put it, knowledge knowledge tool, think important
concept people embed minds. And, listen, grateful discussion
raising topics. think people, many people know work
testosterone, stress, covered today, work freewill
idea hopeless total control. think realizing
listening neither true, solution resides

01:23:44 Robert’s New Book: “Determined: Science Life Without Free Will”

understanding freewill lack it, [laughs] also neuroplasticity.
working book freewill, willing tell us little bit
book process can look forward to? - Yeah,
going really slow. Title is, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill."


essentially first half book trying convince reader, okay, not
no freewill whatsoever, least lot less normally assumed.
going standard arguments freewill, doesn't make sense
21st century science? led reading lot frustrating
philosophers basically willing admit stuff made like atoms
molecules. like physical reality sort world, not just relying
magic, believe freewill magical reasons, doesn't make
sense. Okay, first half book hopefully convince people
much less freewill used think. second half gigantic
juncture built around fact haven't thought freewill since like
adolescent. despite thinking way, still absolutely no idea
supposed function belief. supposed go everyday life
anything feel entitled isn't true? angers hatreds feel aren't justified,
no thing appropriate, blame punishment praise reward,
none makes sense, somebody like even compliments haircut,
conditioned say, oh, thanks, something do.
supposed function that? second half wrestling that,
punchline is, going incredibly hard. think going
hard subtract notion freewill making sense like serial murderers,
going thousand times harder making sense somebody says "good job"
you. [Andrew laughs] exact reality sort
interpretations. going incredibly hard, nonetheless look
history subtracted notion agency sorts realms
blame, starting thinking witches caused hailstorms 500 years ago notion
psychodynamically screwed mothers cause schizophrenia, done it.
done endless number times, able subtract sense volition
understanding world works around us. don't murderers running
amuck street, society hasn't collapsed puddle, fact,
humane society. good news possible done repeatedly
past, going hard hell. hard hell try write
coherently, [laughs] discovering, going slowly. - Well, speak many, many
people say really excited book done will
patiently wait, great excitement book, "Determined". said title,
correct? - Yeah, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill". seems like


can't publish book days without sub-title, it? - Fantastic. Well,
excited read book. grateful conversation today, learned
ton. Every time speak learn, really pleasure delight
interact today previous years, say, colleagues.

2020 restrictive separated friends. Now it's,
really focus together not bring elements phones.
brings great hope generation, [laughs] maybe will...
knows, maybe run off study baboons, need field researchers.


along lines choice, like shift gears slightly talk freewill,
ability make choices all. - Well, personal way left field inflammatory
stance is, don't think shred freewill despite 95% philosophers.
think probably majority neuroscientists saying freewill least
circumstances. don't think all. reason is,
something, behave, make choice, whatever. understand
that, intention come from? Part due like sensory

bloodstream morning. whether wonderful
stressful last three months sort neuroplasticity happened. Part
hormone levels exposed fetus. Part culture ancestors

ultimately one factor. talking evolution

freewill? Meaning, allow say, ah, okay, accept choices
somewhat predetermined, yet knowing gives additional layer

can produce wonderfully positive belief change can happen. Even


traumatic change, even worst circumstances, unlikely people, change
can happen, things can change. Don't fatalistic, don't decide
mechanistic, biological machines nothing can ever... Change can happen,
people go off rails translating into, can change ourselves. don't,
can't no freewill. However, can changed circumstance.
point is, like look Aplysia, sea slug learned retract gill
response shock tail, can like conditioning, Pavlovian conditioning
it, learned, behavior changed environment. hear
news something like horrifically depressing going on, refugees wherever.
result, feel little bit helpless less sense efficacy
world, behaviors changed. Okay, okay, yeah, guess that,
remarkable thing is, exact neurobiology. signal transduction

playing obviously much, much fancier domain. learned
change possible despite understanding mechanistically can't change
volitionally, understand change possible, just
changed ability brain respond optimistic stimuli. changed
ability brain now send direction exposed
information will seem cheerful rather depressing. Oh God, amazing,
Nelson Mandela Martin Luther king folks did. Wow,
adverse circumstances, able do. Maybe can also, maybe can go
read people like get even data points change
neurochemistry, responses different now. tilted little bit
direction feeling like can make difference instead damn
hopeless. enormous change can happen, last thing come
view of, nothing less sum biology interactions
environment,

01:20:50 Apply Knowledge & Learning

throw hands say, thus no use trying change anything. -
can acknowledge change extremely hard impossible, circumstances


can change, yet striving better human beings still worthwhile
endeavor. correct? - Absolutely. simply knowledge, either
experience making end right neurobiology class taught
change can happen within framework mechanistic neurobiology.
now open made optimistic good news world around you.
likely inspired that, resistant getting
discouraged bad news, simply now understand possible. - Mm-hmm,
yeah, somebody spent much career working hippocampus,
assume believer neuroplasticity, neural circuits can change
response experience, so-called top-down mechanisms
prefrontal cortex talking can play role there,
decision try change pursuit knowledge pursuit experience
can shape circuitry, therefore make us different machines, speak. - Yeah.
not can say prenatal hormone exposure changed way brain
constructed, learning prenatal hormone exposure can change construction
brain will change brain right now, think
intentions came from. Wow, maybe something it. knowledge
knowledge effector itself. - important powerful
statement hear. think many people think tool, doesn't involve pill
protocol, useless. certainly pills protocols
useful variety context variety things, idea knowledge itself,
whereas put it, knowledge knowledge tool, think important
concept people embed minds. And, listen, grateful discussion
raising topics. think people, many people know work
testosterone, stress, covered today, work freewill
idea hopeless total control. think realizing
listening neither true, solution resides

01:23:44 Robert’s New Book: “Determined: Science Life Without Free Will”

understanding freewill lack it, [laughs] also neuroplasticity.
working book freewill, willing tell us little bit
book process can look forward to? - Yeah,
going really slow. Title is, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill."


essentially first half book trying convince reader, okay, not
no freewill whatsoever, least lot less normally assumed.
going standard arguments freewill, doesn't make sense
21st century science? led reading lot frustrating
philosophers basically willing admit stuff made like atoms
molecules. like physical reality sort world, not just relying
magic, believe freewill magical reasons, doesn't make
sense. Okay, first half book hopefully convince people
much less freewill used think. second half gigantic
juncture built around fact haven't thought freewill since like
adolescent. despite thinking way, still absolutely no idea
supposed function belief. supposed go everyday life
anything feel entitled isn't true? angers hatreds feel aren't justified,
no thing appropriate, blame punishment praise reward,
none makes sense, somebody like even compliments haircut,
conditioned say, oh, thanks, something do.
supposed function that? second half wrestling that,
punchline is, going incredibly hard. think going
hard subtract notion freewill making sense like serial murderers,
going thousand times harder making sense somebody says "good job"
you. [Andrew laughs] exact reality sort
interpretations. going incredibly hard, nonetheless look
history subtracted notion agency sorts realms
blame, starting thinking witches caused hailstorms 500 years ago notion
psychodynamically screwed mothers cause schizophrenia, done it.
done endless number times, able subtract sense volition
understanding world works around us. don't murderers running
amuck street, society hasn't collapsed puddle, fact,
humane society. good news possible done repeatedly
past, going hard hell. hard hell try write
coherently, [laughs] discovering, going slowly. - Well, speak many, many
people say really excited book done will
patiently wait, great excitement book, "Determined". said title,
correct? - Yeah, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill". seems like


can't publish book days without sub-title, it? - Fantastic. Well,
excited read book. grateful conversation today, learned
ton. Every time speak learn, really pleasure delight
interact today previous years, say, colleagues.
thank again, Robert, everything hard, hard work
thinking put work clear put lot hard work

social media prevalent. know not particularly active social
media although might pleasantly, don't know unpleasantly surprised find
lot positive discussion work, don't even
need there. just continue discuss [laughs] work.
interesting social media found context very, broad. mean,
one argue one selects follow news articles reading,
etc. can create kind funneling information can dangerous.
verification crazy ideas even just less exposure new ideas. also
idea social media incredibly broad context. scroll feed,
no longer like eighth grade classroom office faculty
meeting. exposed thousands, not millions contexts, meal,
soccer game, person's body, person's intellect. YouTube another example.
vast, vast landscape. context completely mishmash whereas assuming
evolved. think evolve contexts much constrained.
interacted limited number individuals limited number different domains,
seasons tended constrain us all. course, got phones televisions,
started expand, now ever, brain, prefrontal cortex
sense exist multiple hierarchies essentially wicked
infinity. think might interacting primitive
systems aspects biology? - Well, think get is, ways
punchline of, human humans, use
exact blueprint, hormones, kinases, receptors,
same, everything built exact stuff species
there, go use completely novel way. usually terms
able abstract stuff space time dramatic ways. So, okay, low
ranking baboon can feel badly just like killed rabbit
eat higher ranking guy boots off takes away you,
feel crummy stressful unhappy. exact
things like brain bodies losing sense self-esteem,
can watching movie character screen feeling inadequate compared
like wonderful attractive are. can somebody driving past us
expensive car, don't even see face, can feel belittled
socioeconomic status. can watch like Lifestyles Rich Famous
read Bezos to. reason, decide life less fulfilling


didn't fly space 11 minutes. can feel miserable
ways no organism can, simply can

somebody. finally would, somebody nomadic pastoralist guy

01:23:44 Robert’s New Book: “Determined: Science Life Without Free Will”

understanding freewill lack it, [laughs] also neuroplasticity.
working book freewill, willing tell us little bit
book process can look forward to? - Yeah,
going really slow. Title is, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill."


essentially first half book trying convince reader, okay, not
no freewill whatsoever, least lot less normally assumed.
going standard arguments freewill, doesn't make sense
21st century science? led reading lot frustrating
philosophers basically willing admit stuff made like atoms
molecules. like physical reality sort world, not just relying
magic, believe freewill magical reasons, doesn't make
sense. Okay, first half book hopefully convince people
much less freewill used think. second half gigantic
juncture built around fact haven't thought freewill since like
adolescent. despite thinking way, still absolutely no idea
supposed function belief. supposed go everyday life
anything feel entitled isn't true? angers hatreds feel aren't justified,
no thing appropriate, blame punishment praise reward,
none makes sense, somebody like even compliments haircut,
conditioned say, oh, thanks, something do.
supposed function that? second half wrestling that,
punchline is, going incredibly hard. think going
hard subtract notion freewill making sense like serial murderers,
going thousand times harder making sense somebody says "good job"
you. [Andrew laughs] exact reality sort
interpretations. going incredibly hard, nonetheless look
history subtracted notion agency sorts realms
blame, starting thinking witches caused hailstorms 500 years ago notion
psychodynamically screwed mothers cause schizophrenia, done it.
done endless number times, able subtract sense volition
understanding world works around us. don't murderers running
amuck street, society hasn't collapsed puddle, fact,
humane society. good news possible done repeatedly
past, going hard hell. hard hell try write
coherently, [laughs] discovering, going slowly. - Well, speak many, many
people say really excited book done will
patiently wait, great excitement book, "Determined". said title,
correct? - Yeah, "Determined: Science Life Without Freewill". seems like


can't publish book days without sub-title, it? - Fantastic. Well,
excited read book. grateful conversation today, learned
ton. Every time speak learn, really pleasure delight
interact today previous years, say, colleagues.
thank again, Robert, everything hard, hard work
thinking put work clear put lot hard work

traumatic change, even worst circumstances, unlikely people, change
can happen, things can change. Don't fatalistic, don't decide
mechanistic, biological machines nothing can ever... Change can happen,
people go off rails translating into, can change ourselves. don't,
can't no freewill. However, can changed circumstance.
point is, like look Aplysia, sea slug learned retract gill
response shock tail, can like conditioning, Pavlovian conditioning
it, learned, behavior changed environment. hear
news something like horrifically depressing going on, refugees wherever.
result, feel little bit helpless less sense efficacy
world, behaviors changed. Okay, okay, yeah, guess that,
remarkable thing is, exact neurobiology. signal transduction
pathways happening sea snail incorporate exact kinases
proteases phosphatases mammalian fear
conditioning, alert, conserved. exact thing, simply
playing obviously much, much fancier domain. learned
change possible despite understanding mechanistically can't change
volitionally, understand change possible, just
changed ability brain respond optimistic stimuli. changed
ability brain now send direction exposed
information will seem cheerful rather depressing. Oh God, amazing,
Nelson Mandela Martin Luther king folks did. Wow,
adverse circumstances, able do. Maybe can also, maybe can go
read people like get even data points change
neurochemistry, responses different now. tilted little bit
direction feeling like can make difference instead damn
hopeless. enormous change can happen, last thing come
view of, nothing less sum biology interactions
environment,

01:20:50 Apply Knowledge & Learning

throw hands say, thus no use trying change anything. -
can acknowledge change extremely hard impossible, circumstances


can change, yet striving better human beings still worthwhile
endeavor. correct? - Absolutely. simply knowledge, either
experience making end right neurobiology class taught
change can happen within framework mechanistic neurobiology.
now open made optimistic good news world around you.
likely inspired that, resistant getting
discouraged bad news, simply now understand possible. - Mm-hmm,
yeah, somebody spent much career working hippocampus,
assume believer neuroplasticity, neural circuits can change
response experience, so-called top-down mechanisms
prefrontal cortex talking can play role there,
decision try change pursuit knowledge pursuit experience
can shape circuitry, therefore make us different machines, speak. - Yeah.
not can say prenatal hormone exposure changed way brain
constructed, learning prenatal hormone exposure can change construction
brain will change brain right now, think
intentions came from. Wow, maybe something it. knowledge
knowledge effector itself. - important powerful
statement hear. think many people think tool, doesn't involve pill
protocol, useless. certainly pills protocols
useful variety context variety things, idea knowledge itself,
whereas put it, knowledge knowledge tool, think important
concept people embed minds. And, listen, grateful discussion
raising topics. think people, many people know work
testosterone, stress, covered today, work freewill
