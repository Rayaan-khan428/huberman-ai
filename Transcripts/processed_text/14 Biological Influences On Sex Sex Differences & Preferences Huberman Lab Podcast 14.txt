think good chance going love it, certainly loved mine.
today's episode also brought Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens all-in-
one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. started using Athletic Greens way back 2012.
delighted sponsoring podcast. started using Athletic Greens
found rather confusing figure vitamins minerals take.
Athletic Greens, get vitamins minerals need cover bases. well
probiotics really important. Probiotics shown now numerous studies
important gut microbiome, impacts gut brain axis, well various
aspects bodily health. Athletic Greens get vitamins, minerals probiotics.
also really like way tastes. greens drink, mix water.
mix something else like juice like. mix mine water lemon
juice drink twice day. want try Athletic Greens can go

free travel packs. new month, means new topic Huberman
Lab Podcast. next four episodes, going talking
hormone affects brain body. huge number different topics.
going talk sex. going talk reproduction. going talk
puberty little bit more. talked previous episode. going
talk menopause. going talk birth control. going talk
aggression, competition, winning, losing. Basically, going cover much
hormones possibly can month going go
deep tools protocols. also going talk lot tools relate
things might not want order optimize hormone health, regardless
stage life goals et cetera. sure month rich discussion, rich
tools going learn lot neuroscience endocrinology.
actually field neuro-endocrinology. actually started graduate work.


masters it. say love topic. lot friends
work topic, many consulted episodes. really
excited share information you. dive today's episode,

00:06:47 Announcement: Mood Meter App Works

"All Emotions Sex." want just announcements
designed point useful resources. Last episode, "Talking
Science Emotions Relationships." mentioned Mood Meter app. Mood
Meter App developed people Yale University study biology
psychology emotions. really wonderful app. However, many quickly told
Mood Meter App isn't available area. went link posted
just saying not available area. situation actually lot worse
that. situation that, recorded episode Mood Meter App
working. know 'cause downloaded fresh copy phone.
ensuing weekend, took Mood Meter App repairs. Mood
Meter app now up. available. want really clear. not app affiliated
with. just mentioning you. don't know me. know them, don't know
me. don't kind business relationship. charge 99 cents
app. think free version disappeared last year so. Mood Meter
app. provide link link working. Hopefully won't
take again,

00:08:00 Maximizing Learning Podcast

announcement release episode. Also just want take
step back moment talk little bit logic make
information Huberman Lab Podcast. tend throw lot information
given topic. Many pointed however, don't cover certain things.
just say goal always accurate, no way can
exhaustive. no way can cover everything particular topic. good news
time. goal, least first year Huberman Lab Podcast,
give basis, foundation different topics neuro-plasticity, focus, sleep,
hormones et cetera. course, provide tools along way. going host


guests, actually started recording guests already. even
episodes will include little call primer. little description basics
given topic can get information topics. goal really
educate topics, give foundation topics allow start
exploring episodes future guests, also podcasts
books sources information. saying, "It's
much information." just encourage remind pause button
can return it. Everything's timestamped. feel, not enough
information not covering enough. Just know just beginning. didn't
intend long time will thorough time. thanks
patience please patient yourselves. no reason
digest information one swoop. thing told
speak fast speak slow. wonderful solution this. speak
fast slow can adjust speed YouTube. listening different
format, think also can adjust speed playback. something
wouldn't possible classroom,

00:10:00 New Non-Sleep Deep Rest Protocol, Spanish Subtitles

may find useful. last not least, want point people
NSDR, non-sleep deep rest protocol, folks Madefor put
free resource. does, many pointed out, bear resemblance things like yoga
nidra forms meditation. done stripped intentions
kind verbiage related people might perceive kind
related yoga community specific kind new age-y type techniques. Not
don't like yoga nidra. fact, done yoga nidra daily almost last
goodness, eight years life. love yoga nidra, sometimes complicated
language can separator can discourage people taking protocols
extremely useful. NSDR intentionally generic. designed bring
state deep relaxation combination breathing body scan.
script Madefor linked caption. many
people find prefer scripts like yoga nidra. Scripts
intentions hearing lot kind unusual language around process.
just basic hope enjoy it. prefer typical yoga nidra


scripts go those. many available internet
elsewhere. last not least want point that, episodes now
subtitled English Spanish. prefer digest
information Spanish,

00:11:35 Sexual Differentiation: Hormones, Neurons & Behavior

now available subtitles. Today going talk Science
Sex. particular, sexual differentiation. Now complicated topic sex
adjective, noun verb, depending context. Today going talk
hormonal effects neural effects particular events happen
development guide adolescent adult behavior, including sexual
preference. area fascinating which, actually solid
textbook findings. textbook findings means, many studies
aggregated decades. point now know absolute truths
terms hormones affect brain development, brain impacts hormonal
development interact control behavior instance. also going
talk reproduction, verb sex. course, sex verb, can also carried
independent reproduction. not always, particular humans, just produce
offspring. going covered next episode, absolutely need
understand information episode, order make sense information
next episode. So, today going explore hormones. are,
work, leads masculinization feminization brain body? just throw
one really interesting fact perhaps didn't realize hormones
direct effects body. people know hormone
differences sex differences bodies terms genitalia body hair, distribution
body hair et cetera. also effects hormones brain directly
believe not there're also effects spinal cord. neurons structures
within spinal cord impact direct way, sorts behaviors
possible. fascinating area, might notice going go little bit
slowly topic normally do. want extremely careful
language. topics, may thinking extremely sensitive,
right? course, discussion sex reproduction sensitive one.
today just talking biology. not getting cultural constraints


cultural dialogue. trying today really get biology,
physiology, endocrinology behavior.

00:14:15 Hormones Basics

start talking hormones just remind do.
Hormones definition, substance, chemical released one area
body. Typically something call gland, although can also released
neurons. released often glands, travel effects
gland also organs tissues body. differentiates hormones
things like neurotransmitters, tend act locally. important.
hormone substance secreted one location body, travels, impact
things elsewhere body. Examples tissues produce hormones
thyroid, testes, ovaries et cetera. course areas brain
like hypothalamus pituitary, closely related one another
release hormones cause release yet hormones body.
going cover this. don't know anything endocrinology, still
going able understand today's discussion. going start
discussion about, hormones actually do,

00:15:26 Sperm Meets Egg, Chromosomal Sex, Gonadal Sex,

create thing call masculinization feminization. start
development. Sperm meets egg. Everything happens topic
next episode. But, sperm meets egg. mammalian reproduction. egg
starts duplicate, starts make itself. makes cells. eventually
cells become skin. cells become brain.
cells become muscle. cells become fingers. stuff makes
brain body plan. addition, hormones come mother
developing baby, developing fetus. impact. whether not
brain will call organized masculine organized feminine. say this,
want try discard cultural connotations psychological
connotations, masculinization feminization are.
centering biology. typically, people either two X chromosomes,


traditional language around person female, right? X chromosome
Y chromosome person will become male. Now not always case.
cases XXY, two X chromosomes plus Y
chromosome. also cases XYY. two Y chromosomes.
important biological psychological impacts. first thing
need establish something called chromosomal sex. Whether not
two X chromosomes, X Y chromosome, call chromosomal
sex. next stage separating sexes, call gonadal sex.
Typically not always, typically somebody testes gonads, think
male. somebody ovaries, think female. Although
not always case either. just explore transition chromosomal sex
gonadal sex, fascinating one went form
another. XY typically think

00:17:50 Y Chromosome Inhibition Feminization

promoting masculinization fetus. say Y chromosome
genes genes particular functions suppress female
reproductive organs. Y chromosome gene, encodes
something called Mullerian Inhibiting Hormone. actually hormone
programmed Y chromosome inhibits formation Mullerian Ducts,
important part female reproductive apparatus. critical because,
already seeing transition chromosome Y chromosome gonad.
genes Y chromosome promote formation testes.
genes like SRY gene genes promote formation testes,
also inhibit formation Mullerian Ducts. transition
chromosomal sex gonadal sex important distinction. kind fork
road happens early development fetuses still embryo. Now
interesting well, just Y chromosome

00:19:00 Placenta Endocrine (Hormone-Producing) Organ, Adrenal Testosterone

can suppress Mullerian Duct formation genes Y
chromosome promote testes development. placenta endocrine


organ. think people don't know placenta endocrine organ well.
mother, course carrying fetus adrenal gland can
produce testosterone. instances example, mother either
tumor reason secreting large levels testosterone carrying
fetus XX. leads call masculinization certain aspects
fetus. Typically, will enlarged clitoris. also examples

00:19:45 Hormonal Sex, Morphological Sex

phenotypes body created even though purely XX
chromosomal baby. distinguish chromosomal sex, gonadal sex.
call hormonal sex. effects steroid
hormones, estrogen testosterone derivatives, call
morphological sex shape baby human genitalia jaw
things. actually quite complicated. know,
long distance chromosomes gender identity gender identity lot
social influences roles. area right now dynamic
discussion know. just getting chromosomal sex
call gonadal sex hormonal sex morphological sex, involves number
steps. today going talk steps. fascinating
things indeed relate tools. indeed relate important behavioral
choices. Important choices things avoid pregnant.
not pregnant, things avoid thinking eventually children.
not drive development one direction another, examples
deleterious things environment can actually negatively
impact call sexual development overall,

00:21:04 Hormones Fast & Slow, Sex Steroids Can Turn Genes

regardless chromosomal background. get started that. talk little bit
hormones do. Hormones generally two categories effects.
can either fast can slow. hormones like cortisol
adrenaline, act fast. Adrenaline can increase heart rate fast
secreted body. Cortisol can little bit slower, also can


fast effects. hormones like. Like testosterone estrogen,
refer sex steroid hormones. sex steroid hormones can
quick effects signaling. Meaning can attach cells make cells
different things. can actually quite quick effects brain. lot
people don't know this, fast effects estrogen testosterone
well long-term effects. molecules, interested,
called lipophilic. just means like fatty stuff, can actually pass
fatty membranes. outside cells, well called
nuclear envelope. DNA contents stuff stuffed inside, made
lipid, fat. steroid hormones can actually travel cells get
DNA. Basically interact DNA cells order control gene expression.
can change sorts things cells will become can change way
cells function long-term way. actually presence
genes like SRY Mullerian inhibiting hormone, lead reductions elimination
say, things like Mullerian Ducts promote instead called males
Wolffian Ducts. promote development testes rather ovaries.
need know hormones short-term long-term effects. long-term
effects actually related effects genes genes expressed
repressed, order prevent particular proteins made.

00:23:06 Masculinization, Feminization, Demasculinization, Defeminization

hormones, steroid hormones exceedingly powerful.
going discussion masculinization feminization et cetera, also
need think counterpart. not just masculinizing body
feminizing body brain, also demasculinize brain many cases,
normal biological function typically XX females. de feminization,
suppression certain pathways related feminization body brain.
really fascinating twists story.

00:23:42 Primary Sexual Characteristics: DHT Drives Penis Development

just thrown lot biology you, starts get incredibly
surprising. think straightforward, right? Y chromosome


suppress female reproductive pathway like Mullerian Ducts. promote
development testes testes make testosterone. organizes
brain male wants male like things. females get estrogen
wants female like things. air quotes this. turns isn't
works all. interesting. understand
effects hormones, testosterone estrogen. called primary sexual
characteristics. ones born with. Secondary sexual
characteristics, ones show puberty. happening
brain body spinal cord. going disentangle
giving examples. First, talk development primary sexual
characteristics. ones show birth. one dramatic examples
comes role testosterone creating external genitalia. Now
might think just straight forward. testes, 'cause Y chromosome.
know, got gene codes development testes, get
testosterone penis grows baby born penis. know, one
first things happens baby comes look genitalia,
try make assessment whether not quote boy quote girl,
right? done long time throughout human history. turns
not testosterone responsible development penis baby
X chromosome Y chromosome. different androgen. Androgen
just category hormones includes testosterone, testosterone converted
fetus something called dihydrotestosterone. accomplished
enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase. Now dihydrotestosterone important effects later
life too. will talk those. fact, just want know, dihydrotestosterone
call dominant androgen males. responsible aggression.
responsible lot muscular strength. involved beard growth male pattern
baldness. going talk that. dihydrotestosterone powerful
effects determining genitalia, baby still embryo. ends.
testosterone made. testosterone gets converted enzyme
5-alpha-reductase little structure called tubercle. tubercle will eventually
become penis. say, "Okay, straight forward." testosterone converted
dihydrotestosterone. dihydrotestosterone controls penis growth.
indeed case. primary sexual characteristic. baby will
grow later puberty will release molecule.



00:27:03 Secondary Sexual Characteristics

talked last episode called Kisspeptin. K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N kisspeptin,
will cause release hormones Connatural releasing hormone,
Luteinizing hormone will stimulate testes make testosterone. puberty,
testosterone leads growth development penis, well
accumulation growth pubic hair, deepening voice, secondary
sexual characteristics, okay? dihydrotestosterone creates call
typical masculine phenotype primary sexual characteristics produces.
Testosterone excuse me, produces

00:27:43 Penis Sprouting: Guevedoces

secondary sexual characteristics puberty. interesting phenomenon
published Journal Science 1970s, now
wealth scientific data. relates genetic mutation, 5-alpha-reductase
enzyme converts testosterone dihydrotestosterone doesn't exist. mutated
way genome doesn't exist. actually first identified
Dominican Republic. shown elsewhere. quite rare, shows
robust. happens baby born. Typically baby born don't
measure chromosomes. don't look chromosomal sex XX XY. not
typically done nowadays. Baby born. look baby, look
female. little no external penis. people say, "It's
girl." might, know, celebration girl. guess now call
"Gender Reveal Parties" something like that. don't know this,
anyway. reveal. baby reveal external genitalia simply
naked born. nothing gender,
genitalia sex. baby born. observed that, time
time, baby raised girl, perfectly happy girl around
age 11 12 13, suddenly start sprout penis. actually name
this, called Guevedoces. translation less, penis 12.
strange might sound, makes sense understand underlying mutation.
happens children, Guevedoces, child born.


testes not descended, body. not making lot
testosterone early on. weren't able convert testosterone dihydrotestosterone
lack enzyme 5-alpha-reductase. consequence, primary
sexual characteristic external male genitalia, penis, doesn't develop.
happens baby grows young child essentially treated girl. Generally
report pretty comfortable girls, although not always. testosterone
starts getting secreted testes 'cause kisspeptin brain signals
gonadotropin luteinizing hormone travels testes, testes start
churning testosterone secondary growth penis.
sudden penis. leads complicated situations families
culturally. actually outcomes terms whether not children
decide self identify males females people treat actually varies
quite lot. actually kind adopting third category sex
gender Guevedoces order just offer opportunity explore not
just typical kind girl woman boy man phenotype,
something between. Something people call intersex although intersex
pseudo hermaphroditism actually separate thing altogether. fascinating
point dihydrotestosterone not testosterone responsible primary
growth penis. testosterone later involved secondary sexual
characteristics

00:31:25 Estrogen, NOT Testosterone, Masculinizes Brain

deepening voice, et cetera. Now information gets even
interesting applies essentially everybody. might think testosterone
masculinizes body secondary sexual characteristic way.
dihydrotestosterone another androgen, masculinizes primary sexual
characteristics. growth penis early on, testosterone must masculinize
brain. fact aspects masculinization brain body,
independent genitalia. Now might obvious you, people
probably don't realize that. Yes indeed brain receptors testosterone. also
receptors estrogen. fascinating thing look brains
people Y chromosomes testes make testosterone,
look brains people don't Y chromosomes testes therefore


make far less testosterone general, realize cells brain
differ call males females, XY, XX receptors
testosterone, masculinization brain not accomplished
testosterone. want repeat this. masculinization brain not accomplished
testosterone. accomplished estrogen. Testosterone can converted
estrogen enzyme called aromatase. vitally important understand.

00:33:15 Breast Development Males: Aromatase; Puberty, & Steroids Athletes

Testosterone can converted estrogen something called aromatase. give
example happens later life, just illustrate principle really
embed mind. puberty boys, XY chromosome individuals. not
uncommon transient sometimes long lasting breast bud development.
Testosterone goes puberty, reasons talked before.
testosterone gets converted estrogen enzyme called aromatase.
Aromatase made several sources body. One main sources body fat.
can make lot aromatase. Sometimes even see fairly dramatic breast
development males puberty. Sometimes transient, sometimes not.
place see athletes bodybuilders take lot anabolic
steroids. take high levels androgens. taking testosterone super
physiological doses. Sometimes not always. will convert testosterone
estrogen get called gynecomastia. development
male breast tissue. Sometimes get cut surgically. times start
trying take estrogen blockers order try suppress try block
prolactin. topic going get detail. important
understand testosterone can converted estrogen aromatase.
Aromatase not just made body fat. neurons brain make
aromatase

00:34:50 Estrogen Powerfully Controls Brain Development Individuals

convert testosterone estrogen. testosterone converted estrogen.
words, estrogen masculinizes XY individual. masculinizes brain.
profound effects sorts things. behavior, outlook world


et cetera. think people don't realize estrogen comes
testosterone

00:35:19 Avoiding Hormonal Disruption Children & Adults: Specific Oils, Creams, Etc.

masculinizes male brain, XY brain. Not testosterone
dihydrotestosterone. just want mention tools. might asking yourself,
"How tools possibly come stage conversation talking
sexual development talking differentiation tissues
body." Well, true children parents adults. want emphasize
things environmental things people use
homes sometimes actually can impact hormone levels can impact sexual
development fairly profound ways. want clear, not pulling
rare journal never heard it. pulling textbooks.
particular, today guiding lot conversation work "Behavioral
Endocrinology," book Randy Nelson Lance Kriegsfeld. True experts
field. going talk work Tyrone Hayes UC Berkeley
environmental toxins impacts things like testosterone
estrogen. going touch them. going give anecdotal evidence
grounded studies, will provide caption reference here.
One actually really interesting helps illustrate principle
talking is. years ago, lot excitement Evening
Primrose Oil. Evening Primrose Oil lot products typically associated
skin beauty skin health. generalizing here. typically
mothers sisters using it. actually examples starting crop
young boys getting accelerated breast bud development skin contact
women using Evening Primrose Oil. Evening Primrose Oil chemically lot
like estrogen lot estrogenic compounds. number things
like this. believe not things like pine pollen look much like testosterone
structurally. less testosterone. bioavailability humans isn't
clear. Evening Primrose Oil lot estrogenic elements it. Just structurally
built. cases boys understandably know,
hugged mom maybe even like showering taking. know using
Evening Primrose Oil solution. things will actually change levels estrogens


boys girls. wasn't just issue young boys. also issue
young girls. not Evening Primrose Oil bad, just many
probably heard dangers Soy Isoflavones things like that.
impact soy estrogen levels is, decent evidence support that.
However, lot factors severe. one
Evening Primrose Oil. regardless age, just put way people
might wanting drive hormones estrogenic androgenic.
know preference is? don't know. case, things like
pre Evening Primrose Oil can actually promote estrogenic pathways body
can go transdermal. Likewise, testosterone replacement therapy
fairly widespread nowadays. people accomplish cream. pretty
well understood that, someone's taking want avoid contact anyone.
Skin contact anyone trying promote estrogenic activity body.

00:39:00 Environmental Endocrine Disruptors, Sperm Count Decline, Vincloziline

especially children. one. issue environmental factors.
Now this, know, just going highlight, one starts talking
environmental factors poisoning us disrupting growth fertility rates
can start sound little bit crazy. Except start actually look
real data, Data quality research labs funded Federal government funded, not
companies sources, really aimed understanding
underlying biology is. really, grateful Tyrone Hayes
UC Berkeley. remember way back graduate student late nineties,
goodness. UC Berkeley. remember him, studying frogs. talking
developmental defects frogs live different waters around
California, also elsewhere. identified substance, present lot
waterways throughout country countries. US beyond. Certainly not
just restricted California, atrazine. A-T-R-A-Z-I-N-E. Again,
stuff textbooks. causes severe testicular malformations. again, atrazine
exposure serious. interesting look data, find
sites Western Midwestern sections United States 10 92% male
frogs. frogs mind you, testicular abnormalities. severe
testicular malformations testes rather sperm. actually


organ itself, gonad itself. Now well known now atrazine many
herbicides. know, whereas say 80's 90's discussion
around herbicides negative effects considered kind like hippy-dippy stuff
stuff hear know, local community markets kind
new age communities. Now solid data, Federally funded labs major
universities peer reviewed published excellent journals, showing
indeed many herbicides can negative effects, primarily impacting
ratios hormones either mothers testes, altering testes
fathers direct effects developing young animals potentially humans.
ask, "Well, humans? Frogs wonderful, humans?"
data happening isn't going scary stuff.
also going talk tools ameliorate offset effects. One
be, cautious Evening Primrose well testosterone creams, depending
whether not want androgenic estrogenic depending needs.
across human populations, sperm counts indeed declining, okay? 1940,
average, average density human sperm 113 million per milliliter semen.
measured. many sperm per milliliter semen. 1990 figure
dropped 66. went 113 million per milliliter 66 million per milliliter
United States Western Europe. not just US thing. Researchers also
estimated volume semen produced men dropped 20% time,
reduced sperm count per generation even further. 1981 1991, ratio
normal spermatogenesis decreased 56.4% 26.9%. lot
happening primarily herbicides widespread use reduce
sperm counts. going profound effects not just sperm counts,
development, sexual development level gonads brain.
need testosterone get dihydrotestosterone primary sexual
characteristics. need estrogen come testosterone masculinize
brain. course, not just focusing sperm testosterone. course
also know many herbicides disrupting estrogens similar way.
leading hyper estrogenic, excuse me, states might explain puberty
happening much earlier young girls days. lot things
happening. Now mean run around neurotically avoid
anything includes things like atrazine avoiding kinds
herbicides? don't know you. seem pretty marked


effects, animal studies human studies. know, can open
textbook like endocrinology textbook find things like Vinclozolin. V-I-N-C-L-O-
Z-O-L-I-N, fungicide anti-androgen. give animals, rats.
instead forming penis, don't form penis. basically, not
form clitoris,

00:44:20 Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome: Hormones Need Receptors, SARMS

just don't form penis. talk female sexual development.
always is, talk normal biology. talk little bit
kind extraordinary unusual set cases, talk
illustrate important principle things work typical circumstances.
mutation called androgen insensitivity syndrome. understanding
androgen insensitivity syndrome works can help really understand hormones
impact sexual development. works. individuals XY,
Y chromosome, born make testosterone. testes
don't Mullerian Ducts Y chromosome Mullerian
inhibiting hormone. However, individuals look completely female. general,
report feeling like girls young, women older.
something unusual happening individuals XY
chromosomal type not XX. happening? Well happening
testes making testosterone, receptor testosterone mutated.
therefore testes never descend. don't ovaries, testes
testes internal. typically individuals find actually XY
chromosomes. know, chromosomal sex male. will.
gonadal sex male, gonads, testes inside body. don't actually
develop scrotum. don't make ovaries. don't menstruate around
time puberty sign something different. never
menstruate around puberty. look deeply enough, find
actually XY. make testosterone body can't make use
testosterone don't receptors. receptors vitally
important some, secondary sexual characteristics talked
about. Body hair, penis growth puberty et cetera. live fairly happy lives
females. Although course can't conceive, right? don't uterus,


don't ovaries. also general, don't produce sperm quantities enough
actually reproduce somebody else, although sometimes can.
believe not, not going name names actually reports
several people, fairly prominent people throughout history androgen
insensitivity syndrome people suspected did. reason not name names
that, gets right heart whether not male female.
say right? XY chromosomes gonadally testes inside.
yet, looked bodies looked faces, say almost
certainty appeared female. naturally occurring experiment, points
fact testosterone shows body impacts things
levels receptor profound effect phenotype. external body plan.
again, talking order illustrate principle order
effects, hormone doesn't just present. hormone actually
able bind receptor take action target cells. again, just throw
example people using performance enhancing drugs. Although
pretty broad statement, nowadays lot excitement so-called
SARMs. receptor side. talk future
episode. just say teaser SARMs happening right
now augmenting sports performance, testosterone directly also
testosterone derivatives also altering things level receptor
exceedingly interesting revealing us many ways

00:48:41 Estrogen Establishes “Masculine” Brain Circuits, Testosterone

hormones can impact brain body. ways didn't suspect. Perhaps
simplest way understand estrogen testosterone impact masculinization
feminization brain behavior statement. actually closing
sentence abstract colleague Neuronal Shaw Stanford school
medicine published. estrogen, estrogen aromatized
testosterone aromatase, sets masculine repertoire sexual, animals
humans, territorial behaviors. sets circuitry brain. Estrogen
that. Estrogen sets masculine circuitry brain testosterone
controls display behaviors later life. find incredibly
interesting. think just testosterone one thing estrogen


another,

00:49:42 Cannabis, Alcohol: Babies, Puberty & Adults

turns nature far interesting that. Okay,
things impact sexual development early life later life. talk
cannabis. talk alcohol dare say talk cell phones. Something
never thought ever do, either podcast classroom. But,
days really interesting data. think aware them. First
all, cannabis, marijuana, THC. realize now lot different variance
this. lot different strains cannabis. personally not pot smoker.
just not me. not talking moral legal implications, States
decriminalized, places really illegal places basically legal.
check, know live understand laws. not
about. know however, exception one study
many studies point fact THC things cannabis promote
significant increases aromatase activity. Now pot smokers aren't going like this,
especially male pot smokers aren't going like reality. Remember,
hearing background Costello snoring really loud? put
screen? not cannabis smoker, can imagine why. Come Costello.
Come buddy, come here. asleep. Come here. [indistinct],
go. dog definitely not need cannabis. state time.
highly... Oh asleep still. asked see Costello just
listening audio, maybe gives [Costello grunts] Oh, okay. going let
get back sleep. always here, asked see him. Costello's not
pot smoker either. dog sitter pot smoker years ago.
favorite dog sitter but, not pot smoker. Again, no judgment. deal.
cannabis, not clear THC elements marijuana plant,
promote aromatase activity. Now, observed anecdotally pot
smokers higher incidence developing something mentioned
gynecomastia, breast bud development. full-blown breast development males.
may women want increase estrogenic activity. Remember
females make testosterone. comes adrenals, right? don't testes.
comes adrenals testosterone can also aromatized. Although


typically aromatase activity referring examples
males. testosterone can increase estrogenic activity. might say, "Oh
know, therefore testosterone reduce sexual behavior? create sorts
things related low testosterone?" Not necessarily, not necessarily.
why, estrogen males females important things like libido sexual
behavior. going repeat that. estrogen low males, can actually inhibit
libido sexual behavior. don't want estrogen high low. Whether
not male female. Now course females, estrogen levels tend higher
males. speaking generally here. just think back chromosomal
sex. referring say male female, although nuance
course. females, testosterone comes adrenals
powerful effect libido desire reproduce. next episode, going
talk works relationship birth control, relationship
menopause. also going talk whole thing works males well.
cannabis aspects marijuana plant can impact levels testosterone
estrogen increasing aromatase. people aware that. well,
good data. able find several studies PubMed, pointing fact
smoking marijuana pregnancy can shift pattern hormones
developing fetus, promotes estrogenic outcomes. Now earlier said
estrogen masculinized male brain, utero true, way
cannabis seems work, least studies able identify
promotes circulating estrogen body therefore can counteract
masculinizing effects things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone, primary
secondary sexual characteristics. mention because, know think nowadays
marijuana use far widespread certainly puberty can profound
effects hormonal systems. another episode, goes really
deep this. yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity increasing aromatase.
Almost everyone can appreciate drinking pregnancy, not good
developing fetus. Fetal alcohol syndrome well-established negative outcome
pregnancy. something cognitive effects really bad.
actually physical malformation, et cetera. drinking pregnancy, not good.
Probably drinking puberty, not good either. alcohol, particular certain
things like beer grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity. Now, isn't
just protecting young boys estrogenic activity. also protecting girls


excessive even hypo estrogenic effects alcohol puberty. Now, many teenagers
drink. College students drink important point puberty doesn't start
one day end another day, puberty beginning middle end,
development really entire lifespan. idea know, puberty know
open close. just false.

00:56:25 Cell Phone Technology: Effects Hormones, Ovaries, & Testicles

Okay, talked cannabis. talked alcohol. talk cell
phones. First all, use cell phone. use often. not think evil
devices. think require discipline order make sure not
become negative force one's life. personally restrict number hours
phone particular social media. answer email particular
times day. cell phone itself? know, junior
professor. pre-tenure early professor. taught class neural circuits
health disease. one students asked me, know cell phones safe
brain? know, data point fact were. least
no data showing wasn't. still don't answer that, frankly.
don't see lot studies it. not personally aware evidence quality
peer reviewed studies showing cell phones bad brain holding
phone ear bad Bluetooth bad that. just not aware
quality studies. aware quality studies, peer reviewed study please reference
them, put comment section. Send me, however like. love
see them. not aware them. However, interested particular study
published back 2013 rats. basically took cell phone put
cage rats looked basically testicular ovarian development rats
saw minor still statistically significant defects ovarian testicular
development. Since now returning literature, seen absolute
explosion studies. quality journals,
call not blue ribbon journals. Identifying defects testicular ovarian
development mere exposure cell phone emitted waves. just call that, don't
know are. sounds almost crazy, right? Anytime somebody starts
talking EMS things like that, kind worry like, person okay?
look, literature pointing direction chronic exposure gonads


cell phones creating serious issues terms health cellular level
terms output. output testes sperm production.
Swimming speed sperm important feature sperm health. ovaries
estrogenic output. regular cycles are. animals, cycles
little bit different humans. don't menstrual cycle.
estrous cycle, generally around four days. think say based
literature, effects cell phone emitted waves gonadal development.
question is, proximity cell phone gonads? Now, taken
literature observe it. course point captions.
don't like cell phone pocket, well past puberty,
nonetheless effects seen adult animals. effects now
demonstrated humans. just talk couple
effects. paper published journal, "Clinical Biochemistry" S. Gander et al.
Looked hormone profiles people based proximity phone frequency
phone use, stored phone body. Aa well proximity
lived to, guess called radio-frequency towers. base stations.
looking effects radio frequency radiation RFR human hormone
profiles. show significant decreases cortisol. might say, "Well, might
good." need morning cortisol bump order wake up. Morning cortisol
good. also thyroid hormones significantly reduced. Prolactin young
females, definitely concerning testosterone levels males females.
so, now quite good data showing close phone much
day close interesting question living near one base stations
apparently can effects hormone profiles. see study like one
always ask, "Well, things also effects
hormone profiles?" Right? Cause imagine ran study
people live close waterway, close highway lot exhaust
buses cars, might see similar effects. take sorts
studies grain salt. think interesting. given last time
looked data way back junior professor like
one two studies find. One studies pointed increases
testosterone rats, close proximity radio-frequency
radiation waves. case, showed decreases testosterone.
really wasn't conclusion takeaway that. Now, pretty impressive


amount data pointing fact effects things hormones.
don't know information. not going stop using phone but,
light work Tyrone Hayes others looking sperm counts looking
decrease testosterone levels sperm counts fertility last 20, 30
years, perhaps know, not surprising. Although again, cell phones
smartphones really prominent use mostly within last 10 11 years.

01:02:33 Beards & Baldness Patterns Around World, DHT, 5-alpha-reductase

hard explain declines simply basis cell phone use.
interesting effects hormones actually can observe
outside people, tell something not just level hormones, also
underlying genetics. relate beard growth baldness.
fascinating. molecule, hormone dihydrotestosterone, made testosterone,
hormone primarily responsible facial hair, beard growth. well,
molecule, hormone primarily responsible lack hair head, hair loss.
work? Well, DHT circulates body binds DHT receptors
face promote hair growth. binds DHD receptors scalp promote
hair loss. Not incidentally, drugs designed prevent hair loss 5-alpha-
reductase inhibitors. remember 5-alpha-reductase Guevedoces? Well,
people discovered Güevedoces, went lot research
underlying biochemistry really interesting molecule dihydrotestosterone.
identified 5-alpha-reductase. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors basis
anti-hair loss treatments there. interesting things
here. First all, side effect profiles treatments hair loss quite severe
many individuals. Remember DHT primary androgen libido, strengthened
connective tissue repair, aggression. Even aggression course held
check, just sort ambition aggression related dopamine, within
testosterone pathway, less pure testosterone, although pure testosterone
effects. DHT is, least primate species including humans, dominant
androgen sorts effects. look somebody, everyone can
predict whether not going go bald based looking their, always
taught mother's father. mother's father bald, higher
probability going go bald. pattern DHT receptors scalp, will


dictate whether not going go bald everywhere just front
called crown type baldness. density beard tells density
DHT receptors. Now varies background, genetic background. actually
around world nowadays, people travel people form couples
kids many different people different mixed cultures. seeing starting
disappear. areas areas world men seem
pattern baldness, like strip baldness center, hair still
sides full beards. patterns DHT receptors
genetically determined. Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still high, DHT levels
blood can high yet people will light beards no beards.
don't lot DHT receptors face. still
cultures see people huge beard, tons beard. beards growing
way eyes huge heads hair.
lot DHT receptors face not scalp. lot
effects DHT can just see male phenotypes. interesting
hair loss drugs are, prevent hair loss drugs, directly aimed preventing
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone.
extent prevent hair loss, also extent have, bunch side effects
associated low DHT.

01:06:39 Creatine & DHT/Hair Loss

Along lines particular sports supplement lot people use called
Creatine. Creatine, now lot research showing Creatine can bring
water muscle. can support strength. number things.
Might even important cognitive promoting. Cognitive enhancement effects,
although mild. studies show can significant. people, not
anecdotal, report creatine promotes hair loss. differs individual.
people true, others no. yes appear, based studies able
find PubMed, creatine promote 5-alpha-reductase activity therefore
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone. makes sense
might promote degree hair loss, well beard growth, well
effects DHT. recall junior high school middle school, going home one Summer
seventh grade, coming back eighth grade kid knew


friends with, went like young kid to, like grown man, full
beard. amazing. like completely transformed. puberty
said before, without doubt accelerated rate development will
go point lives. Even faster infancy just terms huge
number different cognitive changes physical changes. Not surprisingly
individual mostly bald early twenties. must
just exceedingly high levels DHT. also played soccer kid
basically like dribbling past everybody. like grown man, playing soccer
bunch little kids.

01:08:20 Predicting Aging Rates Pubertal Rates

Full beard know, bald 20. rate maturation, rate aging
interesting. hard know rate aging. genetic tests now can allow
that. Things like Horvath Clocks things sort. Beautiful work David
Sinclair Harvard others pointed this. speed entry exit
puberty might be, putting hypothesis. Might interesting
window, fast one going aging developmental arc.
development course, doesn't just start birth end puberty. continues
entire life. think interesting. will often see people, boys girls.
say boys girls, will develop secondary sexual characteristics different rates.
sometimes sequential. know might see kid will, grow tall
big growth spurt, breast development will come little bit later.
features will come little bit later. can also see boys.
person referred earlier, friend developed full beard, know, went
bald. also quite muscular, great athlete. went puberty
exceedingly fast. people go slowly. people will go
puberty age 14, won't start accumulate facial hair much, much later.
voice will change first, early. won't get secondary
sexual characteristics much later. so, don't really know impacts
relates overall trajectory rate aging. interesting thing think
every one us. going offer opportunity experiment
today,



01:10:04 Hyenas, Baseball, & Hypertrophied Clitorises: Androstenedione

females don't self-report lesbian. Dennis noticed published this.
important discovery one first discoveries pointed
fact sex differences biology independent sex. mean,
hearing auto acoustic emissions. just really illustrate that.
former problem study important? know, lot people

00:11:35 Sexual Differentiation: Hormones, Neurons & Behavior

now available subtitles. Today going talk Science
Sex. particular, sexual differentiation. Now complicated topic sex
adjective, noun verb, depending context. Today going talk
hormonal effects neural effects particular events happen
development guide adolescent adult behavior, including sexual
preference. area fascinating which, actually solid
textbook findings. textbook findings means, many studies
aggregated decades. point now know absolute truths
terms hormones affect brain development, brain impacts hormonal
development interact control behavior instance. also going
talk reproduction, verb sex. course, sex verb, can also carried
independent reproduction. not always, particular humans, just produce
offspring. going covered next episode, absolutely need
understand information episode, order make sense information
next episode. So, today going explore hormones. are,
work, leads masculinization feminization brain body? just throw
one really interesting fact perhaps didn't realize hormones
direct effects body. people know hormone
differences sex differences bodies terms genitalia body hair, distribution
body hair et cetera. also effects hormones brain directly
believe not there're also effects spinal cord. neurons structures
within spinal cord impact direct way, sorts behaviors
possible. fascinating area, might notice going go little bit
slowly topic normally do. want extremely careful
language. topics, may thinking extremely sensitive,
right? course, discussion sex reproduction sensitive one.
today just talking biology. not getting cultural constraints


cultural dialogue. trying today really get biology,
physiology, endocrinology behavior.

00:14:15 Hormones Basics

start talking hormones just remind do.
Hormones definition, substance, chemical released one area
body. Typically something call gland, although can also released
neurons. released often glands, travel effects
gland also organs tissues body. differentiates hormones
things like neurotransmitters, tend act locally. important.
hormone substance secreted one location body, travels, impact
things elsewhere body. Examples tissues produce hormones
thyroid, testes, ovaries et cetera. course areas brain
like hypothalamus pituitary, closely related one another
release hormones cause release yet hormones body.
going cover this. don't know anything endocrinology, still
going able understand today's discussion. going start
discussion about, hormones actually do,

00:15:26 Sperm Meets Egg, Chromosomal Sex, Gonadal Sex,

create thing call masculinization feminization. start
development. Sperm meets egg. Everything happens topic
next episode. But, sperm meets egg. mammalian reproduction. egg
starts duplicate, starts make itself. makes cells. eventually
cells become skin. cells become brain.
cells become muscle. cells become fingers. stuff makes
brain body plan. addition, hormones come mother
developing baby, developing fetus. impact. whether not
brain will call organized masculine organized feminine. say this,
want try discard cultural connotations psychological
connotations, masculinization feminization are.
centering biology. typically, people either two X chromosomes,


traditional language around person female, right? X chromosome
Y chromosome person will become male. Now not always case.
cases XXY, two X chromosomes plus Y
chromosome. also cases XYY. two Y chromosomes.
important biological psychological impacts. first thing
need establish something called chromosomal sex. Whether not
two X chromosomes, X Y chromosome, call chromosomal
sex. next stage separating sexes, call gonadal sex.
Typically not always, typically somebody testes gonads, think
male. somebody ovaries, think female. Although
not always case either. just explore transition chromosomal sex
gonadal sex, fascinating one went form
another. XY typically think

00:17:50 Y Chromosome Inhibition Feminization

promoting masculinization fetus. say Y chromosome
genes genes particular functions suppress female
reproductive organs. Y chromosome gene, encodes
something called Mullerian Inhibiting Hormone. actually hormone
programmed Y chromosome inhibits formation Mullerian Ducts,
important part female reproductive apparatus. critical because,
already seeing transition chromosome Y chromosome gonad.
genes Y chromosome promote formation testes.
genes like SRY gene genes promote formation testes,
also inhibit formation Mullerian Ducts. transition
chromosomal sex gonadal sex important distinction. kind fork
road happens early development fetuses still embryo. Now
interesting well, just Y chromosome

00:19:00 Placenta Endocrine (Hormone-Producing) Organ, Adrenal Testosterone

can suppress Mullerian Duct formation genes Y
chromosome promote testes development. placenta endocrine


organ. think people don't know placenta endocrine organ well.
mother, course carrying fetus adrenal gland can
produce testosterone. instances example, mother either
tumor reason secreting large levels testosterone carrying
fetus XX. leads call masculinization certain aspects
fetus. Typically, will enlarged clitoris. also examples

00:19:45 Hormonal Sex, Morphological Sex

phenotypes body created even though purely XX
chromosomal baby. distinguish chromosomal sex, gonadal sex.
call hormonal sex. effects steroid
hormones, estrogen testosterone derivatives, call
morphological sex shape baby human genitalia jaw
things. actually quite complicated. know,
long distance chromosomes gender identity gender identity lot
social influences roles. area right now dynamic
discussion know. just getting chromosomal sex
call gonadal sex hormonal sex morphological sex, involves number
steps. today going talk steps. fascinating
things indeed relate tools. indeed relate important behavioral
choices. Important choices things avoid pregnant.
not pregnant, things avoid thinking eventually children.
not drive development one direction another, examples
deleterious things environment can actually negatively
impact call sexual development overall,

00:21:04 Hormones Fast & Slow, Sex Steroids Can Turn Genes

regardless chromosomal background. get started that. talk little bit
hormones do. Hormones generally two categories effects.
can either fast can slow. hormones like cortisol
adrenaline, act fast. Adrenaline can increase heart rate fast
secreted body. Cortisol can little bit slower, also can


fast effects. hormones like. Like testosterone estrogen,
refer sex steroid hormones. sex steroid hormones can
quick effects signaling. Meaning can attach cells make cells
different things. can actually quite quick effects brain. lot
people don't know this, fast effects estrogen testosterone
well long-term effects. molecules, interested,
called lipophilic. just means like fatty stuff, can actually pass
fatty membranes. outside cells, well called
nuclear envelope. DNA contents stuff stuffed inside, made
lipid, fat. steroid hormones can actually travel cells get
DNA. Basically interact DNA cells order control gene expression.
can change sorts things cells will become can change way
cells function long-term way. actually presence
genes like SRY Mullerian inhibiting hormone, lead reductions elimination
say, things like Mullerian Ducts promote instead called males
Wolffian Ducts. promote development testes rather ovaries.
need know hormones short-term long-term effects. long-term
effects actually related effects genes genes expressed
repressed, order prevent particular proteins made.

00:23:06 Masculinization, Feminization, Demasculinization, Defeminization

hormones, steroid hormones exceedingly powerful.
going discussion masculinization feminization et cetera, also
need think counterpart. not just masculinizing body
feminizing body brain, also demasculinize brain many cases,
normal biological function typically XX females. de feminization,
suppression certain pathways related feminization body brain.
really fascinating twists story.

00:23:42 Primary Sexual Characteristics: DHT Drives Penis Development

just thrown lot biology you, starts get incredibly
surprising. think straightforward, right? Y chromosome


suppress female reproductive pathway like Mullerian Ducts. promote
development testes testes make testosterone. organizes
brain male wants male like things. females get estrogen
wants female like things. air quotes this. turns isn't
works all. interesting. understand

00:49:42 Cannabis, Alcohol: Babies, Puberty & Adults

turns nature far interesting that. Okay,
things impact sexual development early life later life. talk
cannabis. talk alcohol dare say talk cell phones. Something
never thought ever do, either podcast classroom. But,
days really interesting data. think aware them. First
all, cannabis, marijuana, THC. realize now lot different variance
this. lot different strains cannabis. personally not pot smoker.
just not me. not talking moral legal implications, States
decriminalized, places really illegal places basically legal.
check, know live understand laws. not
about. know however, exception one study
many studies point fact THC things cannabis promote
significant increases aromatase activity. Now pot smokers aren't going like this,
especially male pot smokers aren't going like reality. Remember,
hearing background Costello snoring really loud? put
screen? not cannabis smoker, can imagine why. Come Costello.
Come buddy, come here. asleep. Come here. [indistinct],
go. dog definitely not need cannabis. state time.
highly... Oh asleep still. asked see Costello just
listening audio, maybe gives [Costello grunts] Oh, okay. going let
get back sleep. always here, asked see him. Costello's not
pot smoker either. dog sitter pot smoker years ago.
favorite dog sitter but, not pot smoker. Again, no judgment. deal.
cannabis, not clear THC elements marijuana plant,
promote aromatase activity. Now, observed anecdotally pot
smokers higher incidence developing something mentioned
gynecomastia, breast bud development. full-blown breast development males.
may women want increase estrogenic activity. Remember
females make testosterone. comes adrenals, right? don't testes.
comes adrenals testosterone can also aromatized. Although


typically aromatase activity referring examples
males. testosterone can increase estrogenic activity. might say, "Oh
know, therefore testosterone reduce sexual behavior? create sorts
things related low testosterone?" Not necessarily, not necessarily.
why, estrogen males females important things like libido sexual
behavior. going repeat that. estrogen low males, can actually inhibit
libido sexual behavior. don't want estrogen high low. Whether
not male female. Now course females, estrogen levels tend higher
males. speaking generally here. just think back chromosomal
sex. referring say male female, although nuance
course. females, testosterone comes adrenals
powerful effect libido desire reproduce. next episode, going
talk works relationship birth control, relationship
menopause. also going talk whole thing works males well.
cannabis aspects marijuana plant can impact levels testosterone
estrogen increasing aromatase. people aware that. well,
good data. able find several studies PubMed, pointing fact
smoking marijuana pregnancy can shift pattern hormones
developing fetus, promotes estrogenic outcomes. Now earlier said
estrogen masculinized male brain, utero true, way
cannabis seems work, least studies able identify
promotes circulating estrogen body therefore can counteract
masculinizing effects things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone, primary
secondary sexual characteristics. mention because, know think nowadays
marijuana use far widespread certainly puberty can profound
effects hormonal systems. another episode, goes really
deep this. yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity increasing aromatase.
Almost everyone can appreciate drinking pregnancy, not good
developing fetus. Fetal alcohol syndrome well-established negative outcome
pregnancy. something cognitive effects really bad.
actually physical malformation, et cetera. drinking pregnancy, not good.
Probably drinking puberty, not good either. alcohol, particular certain
things like beer grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity. Now, isn't
just protecting young boys estrogenic activity. also protecting girls


excessive even hypo estrogenic effects alcohol puberty. Now, many teenagers
drink. College students drink important point puberty doesn't start
one day end another day, puberty beginning middle end,
development really entire lifespan. idea know, puberty know
open close. just false.

00:56:25 Cell Phone Technology: Effects Hormones, Ovaries, & Testicles

Okay, talked cannabis. talked alcohol. talk cell
phones. First all, use cell phone. use often. not think evil
devices. think require discipline order make sure not
become negative force one's life. personally restrict number hours
phone particular social media. answer email particular
times day. cell phone itself? know, junior
professor. pre-tenure early professor. taught class neural circuits
health disease. one students asked me, know cell phones safe
brain? know, data point fact were. least
no data showing wasn't. still don't answer that, frankly.
don't see lot studies it. not personally aware evidence quality
peer reviewed studies showing cell phones bad brain holding
phone ear bad Bluetooth bad that. just not aware
quality studies. aware quality studies, peer reviewed study please reference
them, put comment section. Send me, however like. love
see them. not aware them. However, interested particular study
published back 2013 rats. basically took cell phone put
cage rats looked basically testicular ovarian development rats
saw minor still statistically significant defects ovarian testicular
development. Since now returning literature, seen absolute
explosion studies. quality journals,
call not blue ribbon journals. Identifying defects testicular ovarian
development mere exposure cell phone emitted waves. just call that, don't
know are. sounds almost crazy, right? Anytime somebody starts
talking EMS things like that, kind worry like, person okay?
look, literature pointing direction chronic exposure gonads


cell phones creating serious issues terms health cellular level
terms output. output testes sperm production.
Swimming speed sperm important feature sperm health. ovaries
estrogenic output. regular cycles are. animals, cycles
little bit different humans. don't menstrual cycle.
estrous cycle, generally around four days. think say based
literature, effects cell phone emitted waves gonadal development.
question is, proximity cell phone gonads? Now, taken
literature observe it. course point captions.
don't like cell phone pocket, well past puberty,
nonetheless effects seen adult animals. effects now
demonstrated humans. just talk couple
effects. paper published journal, "Clinical Biochemistry" S. Gander et al.
Looked hormone profiles people based proximity phone frequency
phone use, stored phone body. Aa well proximity
lived to, guess called radio-frequency towers. base stations.
looking effects radio frequency radiation RFR human hormone
profiles. show significant decreases cortisol. might say, "Well, might
good." need morning cortisol bump order wake up. Morning cortisol
good. also thyroid hormones significantly reduced. Prolactin young
females, definitely concerning testosterone levels males females.
so, now quite good data showing close phone much
day close interesting question living near one base stations
apparently can effects hormone profiles. see study like one
always ask, "Well, things also effects
hormone profiles?" Right? Cause imagine ran study
people live close waterway, close highway lot exhaust
buses cars, might see similar effects. take sorts
studies grain salt. think interesting. given last time
looked data way back junior professor like
one two studies find. One studies pointed increases
testosterone rats, close proximity radio-frequency
radiation waves. case, showed decreases testosterone.
really wasn't conclusion takeaway that. Now, pretty impressive


amount data pointing fact effects things hormones.
don't know information. not going stop using phone but,
light work Tyrone Hayes others looking sperm counts looking
decrease testosterone levels sperm counts fertility last 20, 30
years, perhaps know, not surprising. Although again, cell phones

01:02:33 Beards & Baldness Patterns Around World, DHT, 5-alpha-reductase

hard explain declines simply basis cell phone use.
interesting effects hormones actually can observe

underlying genetics. relate beard growth baldness.
fascinating. molecule, hormone dihydrotestosterone, made testosterone,
hormone primarily responsible facial hair, beard growth. well,
molecule, hormone primarily responsible lack hair head, hair loss.
work? Well, DHT circulates body binds DHT receptors
face promote hair growth. binds DHD receptors scalp promote
hair loss. Not incidentally, drugs designed prevent hair loss 5-alpha-
reductase inhibitors. remember 5-alpha-reductase Guevedoces? Well,
people discovered Güevedoces, went lot research
underlying biochemistry really interesting molecule dihydrotestosterone.
identified 5-alpha-reductase. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors basis
anti-hair loss treatments there. interesting things
here. First all, side effect profiles treatments hair loss quite severe
many individuals. Remember DHT primary androgen libido, strengthened
connective tissue repair, aggression. Even aggression course held
check, just sort ambition aggression related dopamine, within
testosterone pathway, less pure testosterone, although pure testosterone
effects. DHT is, least primate species including humans, dominant
androgen sorts effects. look somebody, everyone can
predict whether not going go bald based looking their, always
taught mother's father. mother's father bald, higher
probability going go bald. pattern DHT receptors scalp, will


dictate whether not going go bald everywhere just front
called crown type baldness. density beard tells density
DHT receptors. Now varies background, genetic background. actually
around world nowadays, people travel people form couples
kids many different people different mixed cultures. seeing starting
disappear. areas areas world men seem
pattern baldness, like strip baldness center, hair still
sides full beards. patterns DHT receptors
genetically determined. Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still high, DHT levels
blood can high yet people will light beards no beards.
don't lot DHT receptors face. still
cultures see people huge beard, tons beard. beards growing
way eyes huge heads hair.
lot DHT receptors face not scalp. lot
effects DHT can just see male phenotypes. interesting
hair loss drugs are, prevent hair loss drugs, directly aimed preventing
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone.
extent prevent hair loss, also extent have, bunch side effects
associated low DHT.

01:06:39 Creatine & DHT/Hair Loss

Along lines particular sports supplement lot people use called
Creatine. Creatine, now lot research showing Creatine can bring
water muscle. can support strength. number things.
Might even important cognitive promoting. Cognitive enhancement effects,
although mild. studies show can significant. people, not
anecdotal, report creatine promotes hair loss. differs individual.
people true, others no. yes appear, based studies able
find PubMed, creatine promote 5-alpha-reductase activity therefore
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone. makes sense
might promote degree hair loss, well beard growth, well
effects DHT. recall junior high school middle school, going home one Summer
seventh grade, coming back eighth grade kid knew


friends with, went like young kid to, like grown man, full
beard. amazing. like completely transformed. puberty
said before, without doubt accelerated rate development will
go point lives. Even faster infancy just terms huge
number different cognitive changes physical changes. Not surprisingly
individual mostly bald early twenties. must
just exceedingly high levels DHT. also played soccer kid
basically like dribbling past everybody. like grown man, playing soccer
bunch little kids.

01:08:20 Predicting Aging Rates Pubertal Rates

Full beard know, bald 20. rate maturation, rate aging
interesting. hard know rate aging. genetic tests now can allow
that. Things like Horvath Clocks things sort. Beautiful work David
Sinclair Harvard others pointed this. speed entry exit
puberty might be, putting hypothesis. Might interesting
window, fast one going aging developmental arc.
development course, doesn't just start birth end puberty. continues
entire life. think interesting. will often see people, boys girls.
say boys girls, will develop secondary sexual characteristics different rates.
sometimes sequential. know might see kid will, grow tall
big growth spurt, breast development will come little bit later.
features will come little bit later. can also see boys.
person referred earlier, friend developed full beard, know, went
bald. also quite muscular, great athlete. went puberty
exceedingly fast. people go slowly. people will go
puberty age 14, won't start accumulate facial hair much, much later.
voice will change first, early. won't get secondary
sexual characteristics much later. so, don't really know impacts
relates overall trajectory rate aging. interesting thing think
every one us. going offer opportunity experiment

scientist comes running hall. never forget this. said, "Give
hands." like, [indistinct]. like, "Give hands." pulls ruler
starts measuring fingers. takes couple measurements
goes away. like, "What that?" Well, course Mark
teaching point. soon after, study Mark directed exploring
finger length ratios. explain are. males females,
people self-reported homosexual heterosexual. just get basic,
call sex differences first. averages. want point out. Anytime
get kind topic, people assume causal, not causal.
averages report. case ratio called D2
D4 digits. D2 index finger. thumb D1. D2
index finger point with. Middle finger D3, whatever with.
D4 so-called ring finger. Okay D5 pinky. case D2


D4 ratio greater self-reported females males. mean?
means digit D4 D4 similar length females men males.
effect particularly, excuse me, pronounced right hand. Although not
always, okay? not handedness. D2 D4 difference
measured correctly. can't just look somebody hands say, "Oh,
ring finger index finger similar. therefore female
know. exposed little testosterone utero." can't look
somebody see index finger much shorter ring finger say,
"Oh, must've exposed lot androgen." actually measure
measure correctly. measure base finger
first crease, way tip past the. can't include
fingernails. growing fingernails, it'd logical folks. can't normally
see back hand. Although, don't know this'll show
look back hand sometimes can see it. know, case
instance. Let see can this. D4 little bit longer D2.
people pronounced right hand. hand,
difference actually far less pronounced. little bit. little bit pronounced
there, not much okay? sort typical ratio see.
turns mice humans, androgen exposed
utero, smaller D4 D2 ratio. Meaning ring finger tends slightly longer
pointer finger. females exposed less androgen
utero typically. fingers tend equal length. subtle
differences averages. invite look paper. published
Nature 2000 replicated six times. Now, gets even
interesting. potentially precarious, going step cautiously here. look
finger length ratios men self-report homosexual, either
typical male pattern D2 D4 ratio hyper masculinized D4 D2 ratio. Now
can't something established modified behavior. something
established utero. fact, present birth okay? completely
divorces interactions hormones behavior. important
theme talking about. going talk even more. Next
episode hormones impact behavior behavior also impact hormones.
case hormones impacting really considered primary sexual
characteristic. doesn't show puberty, shows puberty.


actually established utero. people self-reported lesbians. remember
going collecting data with, collaborators work. Again,
wasn't main driver work. participated analysis. People
self-report lesbians also tend smaller D2 D4 ratio.
consistent auto acoustic emission study Dennis McFadden published.
points fact early exposure androgens may impact, not just
androgenization body plan, also separately sexual preference. Now,
raises sorts interesting questions biological basis sexual preference.

01:29:13 Brain Dimorphisms Sexual Orientation

tell another study. guy named Simon LeVay UCLA.
trained Hubel Wiesel. remember early episodes "Plasticy,"
David Hubel Torsten Wiesel scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovery critical periods brain plasticity. defined
important aspects see brain plasticity. Simon LeVay trained them.
Simon went discover brains people self-report
homosexual brain difference. brain difference area called
Interstitial Nucleus Anterior Hypothalamus. INAH.
published reports. published Science. work refer published
Nature, replicated no fewer six times. McFadden results
point strong biological correlates mate choice, sexual preference. tie
directly things like androgenization estrogenization. Meaning call
maleness femaleness, sort tricky territory. way
described huge range sex can defined earlier. So, want
measure D2 D4 ratio welcome to, also understand
not predictive anything, right? just window possible androgen exposure
early life. plenty men report
heterosexual similar D2 D4 ratios females.
plenty females whose index fingers shorter ring fingers.
perfectly happy say perfectly happy. inclined
believe heterosexual. variation. fact, Mark tells really good
joke. want know whether not somebody homosexual heterosexual,
simply look hands, look D2 D4 ratio guess heterosexual.


right 96% time. 96% time people report
heterosexual average. numbers might changing. joke really joke
science because, falls within realm statistical significance. yet really
illustrates fact none causal. nonetheless interesting
means hormones organizing brain early development ways
can potentially impact opposite sex partner choice later life. Now
course, things can impact opposite sex same-sex partner choice
later life. study not look people reported bisexual.

01:32:00 “Older Brother Effects”: Male Fetuses Might Change Mothers & Subsequent
Brothers

hasn't lot studies yet. One thing interesting,
good scientific data also controversy that, appears
probability male human self-reporting homosexual, increases
number older brothers has. Now, doesn't mean older
brother even 10 older brothers, sure self-report
homosexual. statistically becomes likely somebody will
successive older brother have. idea starting emerge,
developmental neuroendocrinology landscape record within mother
many male fetuses carried, male fetuses secreting certain
things, dihydrotestosterone, things, can feed back genome.
epigenomic effects onto placenta itself, higher
probability subsequent pregnancies offspring will self-report homosexual.
fascinating area biology. noticed today, none deals
current controversies around gender many genders sex, et cetera
separate conversation definition grounded kind concepts
talking today needs take place, taking consideration aspects
sex effects hormones, body, brain. didn't talk lot
spinal cord, will next episode. can just say brain

00:11:35 Sexual Differentiation: Hormones, Neurons & Behavior

now available subtitles. Today going talk Science
Sex. particular, sexual differentiation. Now complicated topic sex
adjective, noun verb, depending context. Today going talk
hormonal effects neural effects particular events happen
development guide adolescent adult behavior, including sexual
preference. area fascinating which, actually solid
textbook findings. textbook findings means, many studies
aggregated decades. point now know absolute truths
terms hormones affect brain development, brain impacts hormonal
development interact control behavior instance. also going
talk reproduction, verb sex. course, sex verb, can also carried
independent reproduction. not always, particular humans, just produce
offspring. going covered next episode, absolutely need
understand information episode, order make sense information
next episode. So, today going explore hormones. are,
work, leads masculinization feminization brain body? just throw
one really interesting fact perhaps didn't realize hormones
direct effects body. people know hormone
differences sex differences bodies terms genitalia body hair, distribution
body hair et cetera. also effects hormones brain directly
believe not there're also effects spinal cord. neurons structures
within spinal cord impact direct way, sorts behaviors
possible. fascinating area, might notice going go little bit
slowly topic normally do. want extremely careful
language. topics, may thinking extremely sensitive,
right? course, discussion sex reproduction sensitive one.
today just talking biology. not getting cultural constraints


cultural dialogue. trying today really get biology,
physiology, endocrinology behavior.

00:14:15 Hormones Basics

start talking hormones just remind do.
Hormones definition, substance, chemical released one area
body. Typically something call gland, although can also released
neurons. released often glands, travel effects
gland also organs tissues body. differentiates hormones
things like neurotransmitters, tend act locally. important.
hormone substance secreted one location body, travels, impact
things elsewhere body. Examples tissues produce hormones
thyroid, testes, ovaries et cetera. course areas brain
like hypothalamus pituitary, closely related one another
release hormones cause release yet hormones body.
going cover this. don't know anything endocrinology, still
going able understand today's discussion. going start
discussion about, hormones actually do,

00:15:26 Sperm Meets Egg, Chromosomal Sex, Gonadal Sex,

create thing call masculinization feminization. start
development. Sperm meets egg. Everything happens topic
next episode. But, sperm meets egg. mammalian reproduction. egg
starts duplicate, starts make itself. makes cells. eventually
cells become skin. cells become brain.
cells become muscle. cells become fingers. stuff makes
brain body plan. addition, hormones come mother
developing baby, developing fetus. impact. whether not
brain will call organized masculine organized feminine. say this,
want try discard cultural connotations psychological
connotations, masculinization feminization are.
centering biology. typically, people either two X chromosomes,


traditional language around person female, right? X chromosome
Y chromosome person will become male. Now not always case.
cases XXY, two X chromosomes plus Y
chromosome. also cases XYY. two Y chromosomes.
important biological psychological impacts. first thing
need establish something called chromosomal sex. Whether not
two X chromosomes, X Y chromosome, call chromosomal
sex. next stage separating sexes, call gonadal sex.
Typically not always, typically somebody testes gonads, think
male. somebody ovaries, think female. Although
not always case either. just explore transition chromosomal sex
gonadal sex, fascinating one went form
another. XY typically think

00:17:50 Y Chromosome Inhibition Feminization

promoting masculinization fetus. say Y chromosome
genes genes particular functions suppress female
reproductive organs. Y chromosome gene, encodes
something called Mullerian Inhibiting Hormone. actually hormone
programmed Y chromosome inhibits formation Mullerian Ducts,
important part female reproductive apparatus. critical because,
already seeing transition chromosome Y chromosome gonad.
genes Y chromosome promote formation testes.
genes like SRY gene genes promote formation testes,
also inhibit formation Mullerian Ducts. transition
chromosomal sex gonadal sex important distinction. kind fork
road happens early development fetuses still embryo. Now
interesting well, just Y chromosome

00:19:00 Placenta Endocrine (Hormone-Producing) Organ, Adrenal Testosterone

can suppress Mullerian Duct formation genes Y
chromosome promote testes development. placenta endocrine


organ. think people don't know placenta endocrine organ well.
mother, course carrying fetus adrenal gland can
produce testosterone. instances example, mother either
tumor reason secreting large levels testosterone carrying
fetus XX. leads call masculinization certain aspects
fetus. Typically, will enlarged clitoris. also examples

00:19:45 Hormonal Sex, Morphological Sex

phenotypes body created even though purely XX
chromosomal baby. distinguish chromosomal sex, gonadal sex.
call hormonal sex. effects steroid
hormones, estrogen testosterone derivatives, call
morphological sex shape baby human genitalia jaw
things. actually quite complicated. know,
long distance chromosomes gender identity gender identity lot
social influences roles. area right now dynamic
discussion know. just getting chromosomal sex
call gonadal sex hormonal sex morphological sex, involves number
steps. today going talk steps. fascinating
things indeed relate tools. indeed relate important behavioral
choices. Important choices things avoid pregnant.
not pregnant, things avoid thinking eventually children.
not drive development one direction another, examples
deleterious things environment can actually negatively
impact call sexual development overall,

00:21:04 Hormones Fast & Slow, Sex Steroids Can Turn Genes

regardless chromosomal background. get started that. talk little bit
hormones do. Hormones generally two categories effects.
can either fast can slow. hormones like cortisol
adrenaline, act fast. Adrenaline can increase heart rate fast
secreted body. Cortisol can little bit slower, also can


fast effects. hormones like. Like testosterone estrogen,
refer sex steroid hormones. sex steroid hormones can
quick effects signaling. Meaning can attach cells make cells
different things. can actually quite quick effects brain. lot
people don't know this, fast effects estrogen testosterone
well long-term effects. molecules, interested,
called lipophilic. just means like fatty stuff, can actually pass
fatty membranes. outside cells, well called
nuclear envelope. DNA contents stuff stuffed inside, made
lipid, fat. steroid hormones can actually travel cells get
DNA. Basically interact DNA cells order control gene expression.
can change sorts things cells will become can change way
cells function long-term way. actually presence
genes like SRY Mullerian inhibiting hormone, lead reductions elimination
say, things like Mullerian Ducts promote instead called males
Wolffian Ducts. promote development testes rather ovaries.
need know hormones short-term long-term effects. long-term
effects actually related effects genes genes expressed
repressed, order prevent particular proteins made.

00:23:06 Masculinization, Feminization, Demasculinization, Defeminization

hormones, steroid hormones exceedingly powerful.
going discussion masculinization feminization et cetera, also
need think counterpart. not just masculinizing body
feminizing body brain, also demasculinize brain many cases,
normal biological function typically XX females. de feminization,
suppression certain pathways related feminization body brain.
really fascinating twists story.

00:23:42 Primary Sexual Characteristics: DHT Drives Penis Development

just thrown lot biology you, starts get incredibly
surprising. think straightforward, right? Y chromosome


suppress female reproductive pathway like Mullerian Ducts. promote
development testes testes make testosterone. organizes
brain male wants male like things. females get estrogen
wants female like things. air quotes this. turns isn't
works all. interesting. understand
effects hormones, testosterone estrogen. called primary sexual
characteristics. ones born with. Secondary sexual
characteristics, ones show puberty. happening
brain body spinal cord. going disentangle
giving examples. First, talk development primary sexual
characteristics. ones show birth. one dramatic examples
comes role testosterone creating external genitalia. Now
might think just straight forward. testes, 'cause Y chromosome.
know, got gene codes development testes, get
testosterone penis grows baby born penis. know, one
first things happens baby comes look genitalia,
try make assessment whether not quote boy quote girl,
right? done long time throughout human history. turns
not testosterone responsible development penis baby
X chromosome Y chromosome. different androgen. Androgen
just category hormones includes testosterone, testosterone converted
fetus something called dihydrotestosterone. accomplished
enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase. Now dihydrotestosterone important effects later
life too. will talk those. fact, just want know, dihydrotestosterone
call dominant androgen males. responsible aggression.
responsible lot muscular strength. involved beard growth male pattern
baldness. going talk that. dihydrotestosterone powerful
effects determining genitalia, baby still embryo. ends.
testosterone made. testosterone gets converted enzyme
5-alpha-reductase little structure called tubercle. tubercle will eventually
become penis. say, "Okay, straight forward." testosterone converted
dihydrotestosterone. dihydrotestosterone controls penis growth.
indeed case. primary sexual characteristic. baby will
grow later puberty will release molecule.



00:27:03 Secondary Sexual Characteristics

talked last episode called Kisspeptin. K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N kisspeptin,
will cause release hormones Connatural releasing hormone,
Luteinizing hormone will stimulate testes make testosterone. puberty,
testosterone leads growth development penis, well
accumulation growth pubic hair, deepening voice, secondary
sexual characteristics, okay? dihydrotestosterone creates call
typical masculine phenotype primary sexual characteristics produces.
Testosterone excuse me, produces

00:27:43 Penis Sprouting: Guevedoces

secondary sexual characteristics puberty. interesting phenomenon
published Journal Science 1970s, now
wealth scientific data. relates genetic mutation, 5-alpha-reductase
enzyme converts testosterone dihydrotestosterone doesn't exist. mutated
way genome doesn't exist. actually first identified
Dominican Republic. shown elsewhere. quite rare, shows
robust. happens baby born. Typically baby born don't
measure chromosomes. don't look chromosomal sex XX XY. not
typically done nowadays. Baby born. look baby, look
female. little no external penis. people say, "It's
girl." might, know, celebration girl. guess now call
"Gender Reveal Parties" something like that. don't know this,
anyway. reveal. baby reveal external genitalia simply
naked born. nothing gender,
genitalia sex. baby born. observed that, time
time, baby raised girl, perfectly happy girl around
age 11 12 13, suddenly start sprout penis. actually name
this, called Guevedoces. translation less, penis 12.
strange might sound, makes sense understand underlying mutation.
happens children, Guevedoces, child born.


testes not descended, body. not making lot
testosterone early on. weren't able convert testosterone dihydrotestosterone
lack enzyme 5-alpha-reductase. consequence, primary
sexual characteristic external male genitalia, penis, doesn't develop.
happens baby grows young child essentially treated girl. Generally
report pretty comfortable girls, although not always. testosterone
starts getting secreted testes 'cause kisspeptin brain signals
gonadotropin luteinizing hormone travels testes, testes start
churning testosterone secondary growth penis.
sudden penis. leads complicated situations families
culturally. actually outcomes terms whether not children
decide self identify males females people treat actually varies
quite lot. actually kind adopting third category sex
gender Guevedoces order just offer opportunity explore not
just typical kind girl woman boy man phenotype,
something between. Something people call intersex although intersex
pseudo hermaphroditism actually separate thing altogether. fascinating
point dihydrotestosterone not testosterone responsible primary
growth penis. testosterone later involved secondary sexual
characteristics

00:31:25 Estrogen, NOT Testosterone, Masculinizes Brain

deepening voice, et cetera. Now information gets even
interesting applies essentially everybody. might think testosterone
masculinizes body secondary sexual characteristic way.
dihydrotestosterone another androgen, masculinizes primary sexual
characteristics. growth penis early on, testosterone must masculinize
brain. fact aspects masculinization brain body,
independent genitalia. Now might obvious you, people
probably don't realize that. Yes indeed brain receptors testosterone. also
receptors estrogen. fascinating thing look brains
people Y chromosomes testes make testosterone,
look brains people don't Y chromosomes testes therefore


make far less testosterone general, realize cells brain
differ call males females, XY, XX receptors
testosterone, masculinization brain not accomplished
testosterone. want repeat this. masculinization brain not accomplished
testosterone. accomplished estrogen. Testosterone can converted
estrogen enzyme called aromatase. vitally important understand.

00:33:15 Breast Development Males: Aromatase; Puberty, & Steroids Athletes

Testosterone can converted estrogen something called aromatase. give
example happens later life, just illustrate principle really
embed mind. puberty boys, XY chromosome individuals. not
uncommon transient sometimes long lasting breast bud development.
Testosterone goes puberty, reasons talked before.
testosterone gets converted estrogen enzyme called aromatase.
Aromatase made several sources body. One main sources body fat.
can make lot aromatase. Sometimes even see fairly dramatic breast
development males puberty. Sometimes transient, sometimes not.
place see athletes bodybuilders take lot anabolic

00:35:19 Avoiding Hormonal Disruption Children & Adults: Specific Oils, Creams, Etc.

masculinizes male brain, XY brain. Not testosterone
dihydrotestosterone. just want mention tools. might asking yourself,
"How tools possibly come stage conversation talking
sexual development talking differentiation tissues
body." Well, true children parents adults. want emphasize
things environmental things people use
homes sometimes actually can impact hormone levels can impact sexual
development fairly profound ways. want clear, not pulling
rare journal never heard it. pulling textbooks.
particular, today guiding lot conversation work "Behavioral
Endocrinology," book Randy Nelson Lance Kriegsfeld. True experts
field. going talk work Tyrone Hayes UC Berkeley
environmental toxins impacts things like testosterone
estrogen. going touch them. going give anecdotal evidence
grounded studies, will provide caption reference here.
One actually really interesting helps illustrate principle
talking is. years ago, lot excitement Evening
Primrose Oil. Evening Primrose Oil lot products typically associated
skin beauty skin health. generalizing here. typically
mothers sisters using it. actually examples starting crop
young boys getting accelerated breast bud development skin contact
women using Evening Primrose Oil. Evening Primrose Oil chemically lot
like estrogen lot estrogenic compounds. number things
like this. believe not things like pine pollen look much like testosterone
structurally. less testosterone. bioavailability humans isn't
clear. Evening Primrose Oil lot estrogenic elements it. Just structurally
built. cases boys understandably know,
hugged mom maybe even like showering taking. know using
Evening Primrose Oil solution. things will actually change levels estrogens


boys girls. wasn't just issue young boys. also issue
young girls. not Evening Primrose Oil bad, just many
probably heard dangers Soy Isoflavones things like that.
impact soy estrogen levels is, decent evidence support that.
However, lot factors severe. one
Evening Primrose Oil. regardless age, just put way people
might wanting drive hormones estrogenic androgenic.
know preference is? don't know. case, things like
pre Evening Primrose Oil can actually promote estrogenic pathways body
can go transdermal. Likewise, testosterone replacement therapy
fairly widespread nowadays. people accomplish cream. pretty
well understood that, someone's taking want avoid contact anyone.
Skin contact anyone trying promote estrogenic activity body.

00:39:00 Environmental Endocrine Disruptors, Sperm Count Decline, Vincloziline

especially children. one. issue environmental factors.
Now this, know, just going highlight, one starts talking
environmental factors poisoning us disrupting growth fertility rates
can start sound little bit crazy. Except start actually look
real data, Data quality research labs funded Federal government funded, not
companies sources, really aimed understanding
underlying biology is. really, grateful Tyrone Hayes
UC Berkeley. remember way back graduate student late nineties,
goodness. UC Berkeley. remember him, studying frogs. talking
developmental defects frogs live different waters around
California, also elsewhere. identified substance, present lot
waterways throughout country countries. US beyond. Certainly not
just restricted California, atrazine. A-T-R-A-Z-I-N-E. Again,
stuff textbooks. causes severe testicular malformations. again, atrazine
exposure serious. interesting look data, find
sites Western Midwestern sections United States 10 92% male
frogs. frogs mind you, testicular abnormalities. severe
testicular malformations testes rather sperm. actually


organ itself, gonad itself. Now well known now atrazine many
herbicides. know, whereas say 80's 90's discussion
around herbicides negative effects considered kind like hippy-dippy stuff
stuff hear know, local community markets kind
new age communities. Now solid data, Federally funded labs major
universities peer reviewed published excellent journals, showing
indeed many herbicides can negative effects, primarily impacting
ratios hormones either mothers testes, altering testes
fathers direct effects developing young animals potentially humans.
ask, "Well, humans? Frogs wonderful, humans?"
data happening isn't going scary stuff.
also going talk tools ameliorate offset effects. One
be, cautious Evening Primrose well testosterone creams, depending
whether not want androgenic estrogenic depending needs.
across human populations, sperm counts indeed declining, okay? 1940,
average, average density human sperm 113 million per milliliter semen.
measured. many sperm per milliliter semen. 1990 figure
dropped 66. went 113 million per milliliter 66 million per milliliter
United States Western Europe. not just US thing. Researchers also
estimated volume semen produced men dropped 20% time,
reduced sperm count per generation even further. 1981 1991, ratio
normal spermatogenesis decreased 56.4% 26.9%. lot
happening primarily herbicides widespread use reduce
sperm counts. going profound effects not just sperm counts,
development, sexual development level gonads brain.
need testosterone get dihydrotestosterone primary sexual
characteristics. need estrogen come testosterone masculinize
brain. course, not just focusing sperm testosterone. course
also know many herbicides disrupting estrogens similar way.
leading hyper estrogenic, excuse me, states might explain puberty
happening much earlier young girls days. lot things
happening. Now mean run around neurotically avoid
anything includes things like atrazine avoiding kinds
herbicides? don't know you. seem pretty marked


effects, animal studies human studies. know, can open
textbook like endocrinology textbook find things like Vinclozolin. V-I-N-C-L-O-
Z-O-L-I-N, fungicide anti-androgen. give animals, rats.
instead forming penis, don't form penis. basically, not
form clitoris,

00:44:20 Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome: Hormones Need Receptors, SARMS

just don't form penis. talk female sexual development.
always is, talk normal biology. talk little bit
kind extraordinary unusual set cases, talk
illustrate important principle things work typical circumstances.
mutation called androgen insensitivity syndrome. understanding
androgen insensitivity syndrome works can help really understand hormones
impact sexual development. works. individuals XY,
Y chromosome, born make testosterone. testes
don't Mullerian Ducts Y chromosome Mullerian
inhibiting hormone. However, individuals look completely female. general,
report feeling like girls young, women older.
something unusual happening individuals XY
chromosomal type not XX. happening? Well happening
testes making testosterone, receptor testosterone mutated.
therefore testes never descend. don't ovaries, testes
testes internal. typically individuals find actually XY
chromosomes. know, chromosomal sex male. will.
gonadal sex male, gonads, testes inside body. don't actually
develop scrotum. don't make ovaries. don't menstruate around
time puberty sign something different. never
menstruate around puberty. look deeply enough, find
actually XY. make testosterone body can't make use
testosterone don't receptors. receptors vitally
important some, secondary sexual characteristics talked
about. Body hair, penis growth puberty et cetera. live fairly happy lives
females. Although course can't conceive, right? don't uterus,


don't ovaries. also general, don't produce sperm quantities enough
actually reproduce somebody else, although sometimes can.
believe not, not going name names actually reports
several people, fairly prominent people throughout history androgen
insensitivity syndrome people suspected did. reason not name names
that, gets right heart whether not male female.
say right? XY chromosomes gonadally testes inside.
yet, looked bodies looked faces, say almost
certainty appeared female. naturally occurring experiment, points
fact testosterone shows body impacts things
levels receptor profound effect phenotype. external body plan.
again, talking order illustrate principle order
effects, hormone doesn't just present. hormone actually
able bind receptor take action target cells. again, just throw
example people using performance enhancing drugs. Although
pretty broad statement, nowadays lot excitement so-called
SARMs. receptor side. talk future
episode. just say teaser SARMs happening right
now augmenting sports performance, testosterone directly also
testosterone derivatives also altering things level receptor
exceedingly interesting revealing us many ways

00:48:41 Estrogen Establishes “Masculine” Brain Circuits, Testosterone

hormones can impact brain body. ways didn't suspect. Perhaps
simplest way understand estrogen testosterone impact masculinization
feminization brain behavior statement. actually closing
sentence abstract colleague Neuronal Shaw Stanford school
medicine published. estrogen, estrogen aromatized
testosterone aromatase, sets masculine repertoire sexual, animals
humans, territorial behaviors. sets circuitry brain. Estrogen
that. Estrogen sets masculine circuitry brain testosterone
controls display behaviors later life. find incredibly
interesting. think just testosterone one thing estrogen


another,

00:49:42 Cannabis, Alcohol: Babies, Puberty & Adults

turns nature far interesting that. Okay,
things impact sexual development early life later life. talk
cannabis. talk alcohol dare say talk cell phones. Something
never thought ever do, either podcast classroom. But,
days really interesting data. think aware them. First
all, cannabis, marijuana, THC. realize now lot different variance
this. lot different strains cannabis. personally not pot smoker.
just not me. not talking moral legal implications, States
decriminalized, places really illegal places basically legal.
check, know live understand laws. not
about. know however, exception one study
many studies point fact THC things cannabis promote
significant increases aromatase activity. Now pot smokers aren't going like this,
especially male pot smokers aren't going like reality. Remember,
hearing background Costello snoring really loud? put
screen? not cannabis smoker, can imagine why. Come Costello.
Come buddy, come here. asleep. Come here. [indistinct],
go. dog definitely not need cannabis. state time.
highly... Oh asleep still. asked see Costello just
listening audio, maybe gives [Costello grunts] Oh, okay. going let
get back sleep. always here, asked see him. Costello's not
pot smoker either. dog sitter pot smoker years ago.
favorite dog sitter but, not pot smoker. Again, no judgment. deal.
cannabis, not clear THC elements marijuana plant,
promote aromatase activity. Now, observed anecdotally pot
smokers higher incidence developing something mentioned
gynecomastia, breast bud development. full-blown breast development males.
may women want increase estrogenic activity. Remember
females make testosterone. comes adrenals, right? don't testes.
comes adrenals testosterone can also aromatized. Although


typically aromatase activity referring examples
males. testosterone can increase estrogenic activity. might say, "Oh
know, therefore testosterone reduce sexual behavior? create sorts
things related low testosterone?" Not necessarily, not necessarily.
why, estrogen males females important things like libido sexual
behavior. going repeat that. estrogen low males, can actually inhibit
libido sexual behavior. don't want estrogen high low. Whether
not male female. Now course females, estrogen levels tend higher
males. speaking generally here. just think back chromosomal
sex. referring say male female, although nuance
course. females, testosterone comes adrenals
powerful effect libido desire reproduce. next episode, going
talk works relationship birth control, relationship
menopause. also going talk whole thing works males well.
cannabis aspects marijuana plant can impact levels testosterone
estrogen increasing aromatase. people aware that. well,
good data. able find several studies PubMed, pointing fact
smoking marijuana pregnancy can shift pattern hormones
developing fetus, promotes estrogenic outcomes. Now earlier said
estrogen masculinized male brain, utero true, way
cannabis seems work, least studies able identify
promotes circulating estrogen body therefore can counteract
masculinizing effects things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone, primary
secondary sexual characteristics. mention because, know think nowadays
marijuana use far widespread certainly puberty can profound
effects hormonal systems. another episode, goes really
deep this. yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity increasing aromatase.
Almost everyone can appreciate drinking pregnancy, not good
developing fetus. Fetal alcohol syndrome well-established negative outcome
pregnancy. something cognitive effects really bad.
actually physical malformation, et cetera. drinking pregnancy, not good.
Probably drinking puberty, not good either. alcohol, particular certain
things like beer grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity. Now, isn't
just protecting young boys estrogenic activity. also protecting girls


excessive even hypo estrogenic effects alcohol puberty. Now, many teenagers
drink. College students drink important point puberty doesn't start
one day end another day, puberty beginning middle end,
development really entire lifespan. idea know, puberty know
open close. just false.

00:56:25 Cell Phone Technology: Effects Hormones, Ovaries, & Testicles

Okay, talked cannabis. talked alcohol. talk cell
phones. First all, use cell phone. use often. not think evil
devices. think require discipline order make sure not
become negative force one's life. personally restrict number hours
phone particular social media. answer email particular
times day. cell phone itself? know, junior
professor. pre-tenure early professor. taught class neural circuits
health disease. one students asked me, know cell phones safe
brain? know, data point fact were. least
no data showing wasn't. still don't answer that, frankly.
don't see lot studies it. not personally aware evidence quality
peer reviewed studies showing cell phones bad brain holding
phone ear bad Bluetooth bad that. just not aware
quality studies. aware quality studies, peer reviewed study please reference
them, put comment section. Send me, however like. love
see them. not aware them. However, interested particular study
published back 2013 rats. basically took cell phone put
cage rats looked basically testicular ovarian development rats
saw minor still statistically significant defects ovarian testicular
development. Since now returning literature, seen absolute
explosion studies. quality journals,
call not blue ribbon journals. Identifying defects testicular ovarian
development mere exposure cell phone emitted waves. just call that, don't
know are. sounds almost crazy, right? Anytime somebody starts
talking EMS things like that, kind worry like, person okay?
look, literature pointing direction chronic exposure gonads


cell phones creating serious issues terms health cellular level
terms output. output testes sperm production.
Swimming speed sperm important feature sperm health. ovaries
estrogenic output. regular cycles are. animals, cycles
little bit different humans. don't menstrual cycle.
estrous cycle, generally around four days. think say based
literature, effects cell phone emitted waves gonadal development.
question is, proximity cell phone gonads? Now, taken
literature observe it. course point captions.
don't like cell phone pocket, well past puberty,
nonetheless effects seen adult animals. effects now
demonstrated humans. just talk couple
effects. paper published journal, "Clinical Biochemistry" S. Gander et al.
Looked hormone profiles people based proximity phone frequency
phone use, stored phone body. Aa well proximity
lived to, guess called radio-frequency towers. base stations.
looking effects radio frequency radiation RFR human hormone
profiles. show significant decreases cortisol. might say, "Well, might
good." need morning cortisol bump order wake up. Morning cortisol
good. also thyroid hormones significantly reduced. Prolactin young
females, definitely concerning testosterone levels males females.
so, now quite good data showing close phone much
day close interesting question living near one base stations
apparently can effects hormone profiles. see study like one
always ask, "Well, things also effects
hormone profiles?" Right? Cause imagine ran study
people live close waterway, close highway lot exhaust
buses cars, might see similar effects. take sorts
studies grain salt. think interesting. given last time
looked data way back junior professor like
one two studies find. One studies pointed increases
testosterone rats, close proximity radio-frequency
radiation waves. case, showed decreases testosterone.
really wasn't conclusion takeaway that. Now, pretty impressive


amount data pointing fact effects things hormones.
don't know information. not going stop using phone but,
light work Tyrone Hayes others looking sperm counts looking
decrease testosterone levels sperm counts fertility last 20, 30
years, perhaps know, not surprising. Although again, cell phones
smartphones really prominent use mostly within last 10 11 years.

01:02:33 Beards & Baldness Patterns Around World, DHT, 5-alpha-reductase

hard explain declines simply basis cell phone use.
interesting effects hormones actually can observe
outside people, tell something not just level hormones, also
underlying genetics. relate beard growth baldness.
fascinating. molecule, hormone dihydrotestosterone, made testosterone,
hormone primarily responsible facial hair, beard growth. well,
molecule, hormone primarily responsible lack hair head, hair loss.
work? Well, DHT circulates body binds DHT receptors
face promote hair growth. binds DHD receptors scalp promote
hair loss. Not incidentally, drugs designed prevent hair loss 5-alpha-
reductase inhibitors. remember 5-alpha-reductase Guevedoces? Well,
people discovered Güevedoces, went lot research
underlying biochemistry really interesting molecule dihydrotestosterone.
identified 5-alpha-reductase. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors basis
anti-hair loss treatments there. interesting things
here. First all, side effect profiles treatments hair loss quite severe
many individuals. Remember DHT primary androgen libido, strengthened
connective tissue repair, aggression. Even aggression course held
check, just sort ambition aggression related dopamine, within
testosterone pathway, less pure testosterone, although pure testosterone
effects. DHT is, least primate species including humans, dominant
androgen sorts effects. look somebody, everyone can
predict whether not going go bald based looking their, always
taught mother's father. mother's father bald, higher
probability going go bald. pattern DHT receptors scalp, will


dictate whether not going go bald everywhere just front
called crown type baldness. density beard tells density
DHT receptors. Now varies background, genetic background. actually
around world nowadays, people travel people form couples
kids many different people different mixed cultures. seeing starting
disappear. areas areas world men seem
pattern baldness, like strip baldness center, hair still
sides full beards. patterns DHT receptors
genetically determined. Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still high, DHT levels
blood can high yet people will light beards no beards.
don't lot DHT receptors face. still
cultures see people huge beard, tons beard. beards growing
way eyes huge heads hair.
lot DHT receptors face not scalp. lot
effects DHT can just see male phenotypes. interesting
hair loss drugs are, prevent hair loss drugs, directly aimed preventing
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone.
extent prevent hair loss, also extent have, bunch side effects
associated low DHT.

01:06:39 Creatine & DHT/Hair Loss

Along lines particular sports supplement lot people use called
Creatine. Creatine, now lot research showing Creatine can bring
water muscle. can support strength. number things.
Might even important cognitive promoting. Cognitive enhancement effects,
although mild. studies show can significant. people, not
anecdotal, report creatine promotes hair loss. differs individual.
people true, others no. yes appear, based studies able
find PubMed, creatine promote 5-alpha-reductase activity therefore
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone. makes sense
might promote degree hair loss, well beard growth, well
effects DHT. recall junior high school middle school, going home one Summer
seventh grade, coming back eighth grade kid knew


friends with, went like young kid to, like grown man, full
beard. amazing. like completely transformed. puberty
said before, without doubt accelerated rate development will
go point lives. Even faster infancy just terms huge
number different cognitive changes physical changes. Not surprisingly
individual mostly bald early twenties. must
just exceedingly high levels DHT. also played soccer kid
basically like dribbling past everybody. like grown man, playing soccer
bunch little kids.

01:08:20 Predicting Aging Rates Pubertal Rates

Full beard know, bald 20. rate maturation, rate aging
interesting. hard know rate aging. genetic tests now can allow
that. Things like Horvath Clocks things sort. Beautiful work David
Sinclair Harvard others pointed this. speed entry exit
puberty might be, putting hypothesis. Might interesting
window, fast one going aging developmental arc.
development course, doesn't just start birth end puberty. continues
entire life. think interesting. will often see people, boys girls.
say boys girls, will develop secondary sexual characteristics different rates.
sometimes sequential. know might see kid will, grow tall
big growth spurt, breast development will come little bit later.
features will come little bit later. can also see boys.
person referred earlier, friend developed full beard, know, went
bald. also quite muscular, great athlete. went puberty
exceedingly fast. people go slowly. people will go
puberty age 14, won't start accumulate facial hair much, much later.
voice will change first, early. won't get secondary
sexual characteristics much later. so, don't really know impacts
relates overall trajectory rate aging. interesting thing think
every one us. going offer opportunity experiment
today,

00:11:35 Sexual Differentiation: Hormones, Neurons & Behavior

now available subtitles. Today going talk Science
Sex. particular, sexual differentiation. Now complicated topic sex
adjective, noun verb, depending context. Today going talk
hormonal effects neural effects particular events happen
development guide adolescent adult behavior, including sexual
preference. area fascinating which, actually solid
textbook findings. textbook findings means, many studies
aggregated decades. point now know absolute truths

understand information episode, order make sense information
next episode. So, today going explore hormones. are,
work, leads masculinization feminization brain body? just throw
one really interesting fact perhaps didn't realize hormones
direct effects body. people know hormone
differences sex differences bodies terms genitalia body hair, distribution
body hair et cetera. also effects hormones brain directly
believe not there're also effects spinal cord. neurons structures
within spinal cord impact direct way, sorts behaviors
possible. fascinating area, might notice going go little bit
slowly topic normally do. want extremely careful
language. topics, may thinking extremely sensitive,
right? course, discussion sex reproduction sensitive one.
today just talking biology. not getting cultural constraints


cultural dialogue. trying today really get biology,
physiology, endocrinology behavior.

00:14:15 Hormones Basics

start talking hormones just remind do.
Hormones definition, substance, chemical released one area
body. Typically something call gland, although can also released
neurons. released often glands, travel effects
gland also organs tissues body. differentiates hormones
things like neurotransmitters, tend act locally. important.
hormone substance secreted one location body, travels, impact
things elsewhere body. Examples tissues produce hormones
thyroid, testes, ovaries et cetera. course areas brain
like hypothalamus pituitary, closely related one another
release hormones cause release yet hormones body.
going cover this. don't know anything endocrinology, still
going able understand today's discussion. going start
discussion about, hormones actually do,

00:15:26 Sperm Meets Egg, Chromosomal Sex, Gonadal Sex,

create thing call masculinization feminization. start

brain will call organized masculine organized feminine. say this,
want try discard cultural connotations psychological
connotations, masculinization feminization are.
centering biology. typically, people either two X chromosomes,


traditional language around person female, right? X chromosome
Y chromosome person will become male. Now not always case.
cases XXY, two X chromosomes plus Y
chromosome. also cases XYY. two Y chromosomes.
important biological psychological impacts. first thing
need establish something called chromosomal sex. Whether not
two X chromosomes, X Y chromosome, call chromosomal
sex. next stage separating sexes, call gonadal sex.
Typically not always, typically somebody testes gonads, think
male. somebody ovaries, think female. Although
not always case either. just explore transition chromosomal sex
gonadal sex, fascinating one went form
another. XY typically think

genes like SRY gene genes promote formation testes,
also inhibit formation Mullerian Ducts. transition

fast effects. hormones like. Like testosterone estrogen,
refer sex steroid hormones. sex steroid hormones can
quick effects signaling. Meaning can attach cells make cells
different things. can actually quite quick effects brain. lot
people don't know this, fast effects estrogen testosterone
well long-term effects. molecules, interested,
called lipophilic. just means like fatty stuff, can actually pass
fatty membranes. outside cells, well called
nuclear envelope. DNA contents stuff stuffed inside, made
lipid, fat. steroid hormones can actually travel cells get
DNA. Basically interact DNA cells order control gene expression.
can change sorts things cells will become can change way
cells function long-term way. actually presence
genes like SRY Mullerian inhibiting hormone, lead reductions elimination
say, things like Mullerian Ducts promote instead called males
Wolffian Ducts. promote development testes rather ovaries.
need know hormones short-term long-term effects. long-term
effects actually related effects genes genes expressed
repressed, order prevent particular proteins made.

00:23:06 Masculinization, Feminization, Demasculinization, Defeminization

hormones, steroid hormones exceedingly powerful.
going discussion masculinization feminization et cetera, also
need think counterpart. not just masculinizing body
feminizing body brain, also demasculinize brain many cases,
normal biological function typically XX females. de feminization,
suppression certain pathways related feminization body brain.
really fascinating twists story.

00:23:42 Primary Sexual Characteristics: DHT Drives Penis Development

just thrown lot biology you, starts get incredibly
surprising. think straightforward, right? Y chromosome


suppress female reproductive pathway like Mullerian Ducts. promote
development testes testes make testosterone. organizes
brain male wants male like things. females get estrogen
wants female like things. air quotes this. turns isn't
works all. interesting. understand
effects hormones, testosterone estrogen. called primary sexual
characteristics. ones born with. Secondary sexual
characteristics, ones show puberty. happening
brain body spinal cord. going disentangle
giving examples. First, talk development primary sexual
characteristics. ones show birth. one dramatic examples
comes role testosterone creating external genitalia. Now
might think just straight forward. testes, 'cause Y chromosome.
know, got gene codes development testes, get
testosterone penis grows baby born penis. know, one
first things happens baby comes look genitalia,
try make assessment whether not quote boy quote girl,
right? done long time throughout human history. turns
not testosterone responsible development penis baby
X chromosome Y chromosome. different androgen. Androgen
just category hormones includes testosterone, testosterone converted

enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase. Now dihydrotestosterone important effects later
life too. will talk those. fact, just want know, dihydrotestosterone
call dominant androgen males. responsible aggression.
responsible lot muscular strength. involved beard growth male pattern

testosterone made. testosterone gets converted enzyme
5-alpha-reductase little structure called tubercle. tubercle will eventually
become penis. say, "Okay, straight forward." testosterone converted
dihydrotestosterone. dihydrotestosterone controls penis growth.
indeed case. primary sexual characteristic. baby will
grow later puberty will release molecule.



00:27:03 Secondary Sexual Characteristics

talked last episode called Kisspeptin. K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N kisspeptin,

Testosterone excuse me, produces

00:27:43 Penis Sprouting: Guevedoces

secondary sexual characteristics puberty. interesting phenomenon
published Journal Science 1970s, now
wealth scientific data. relates genetic mutation, 5-alpha-reductase
enzyme converts testosterone dihydrotestosterone doesn't exist. mutated
way genome doesn't exist. actually first identified
Dominican Republic. shown elsewhere. quite rare, shows
robust. happens baby born. Typically baby born don't
measure chromosomes. don't look chromosomal sex XX XY. not
typically done nowadays. Baby born. look baby, look
female. little no external penis. people say, "It's
girl." might, know, celebration girl. guess now call
"Gender Reveal Parties" something like that. don't know this,
anyway. reveal. baby reveal external genitalia simply
naked born. nothing gender,
genitalia sex. baby born. observed that, time
time, baby raised girl, perfectly happy girl around
age 11 12 13, suddenly start sprout penis. actually name
this, called Guevedoces. translation less, penis 12.
strange might sound, makes sense understand underlying mutation.
happens children, Guevedoces, child born.


testes not descended, body. not making lot

pseudo hermaphroditism actually separate thing altogether. fascinating
point dihydrotestosterone not testosterone responsible primary
growth penis. testosterone later involved secondary sexual

00:31:25 Estrogen, NOT Testosterone, Masculinizes Brain

deepening voice, et cetera. Now information gets even
interesting applies essentially everybody. might think testosterone
masculinizes body secondary sexual characteristic way.
dihydrotestosterone another androgen, masculinizes primary sexual
characteristics. growth penis early on, testosterone must masculinize
brain. fact aspects masculinization brain body,
independent genitalia. Now might obvious you, people
probably don't realize that. Yes indeed brain receptors testosterone. also
receptors estrogen. fascinating thing look brains
people Y chromosomes testes make testosterone,
look brains people don't Y chromosomes testes therefore


make far less testosterone general, realize cells brain
differ call males females, XY, XX receptors
testosterone, masculinization brain not accomplished
testosterone. want repeat this. masculinization brain not accomplished
testosterone. accomplished estrogen. Testosterone can converted
estrogen enzyme called aromatase. vitally important understand.

dihydrotestosterone. just want mention tools. might asking yourself,
"How tools possibly come stage conversation talking
sexual development talking differentiation tissues

grounded studies, will provide caption reference here.
One actually really interesting helps illustrate principle
talking is. years ago, lot excitement Evening

skin beauty skin health. generalizing here. typically
mothers sisters using it. actually examples starting crop
young boys getting accelerated breast bud development skin contact
women using Evening Primrose Oil. Evening Primrose Oil chemically lot
like estrogen lot estrogenic compounds. number things
like this. believe not things like pine pollen look much like testosterone
structurally. less testosterone. bioavailability humans isn't
clear. Evening Primrose Oil lot estrogenic elements it. Just structurally
built. cases boys understandably know,
hugged mom maybe even like showering taking. know using
Evening Primrose Oil solution. things will actually change levels estrogens


boys girls. wasn't just issue young boys. also issue
young girls. not Evening Primrose Oil bad, just many
probably heard dangers Soy Isoflavones things like that.
impact soy estrogen levels is, decent evidence support that.
However, lot factors severe. one
Evening Primrose Oil. regardless age, just put way people
might wanting drive hormones estrogenic androgenic.
know preference is? don't know. case, things like
pre Evening Primrose Oil can actually promote estrogenic pathways body
can go transdermal. Likewise, testosterone replacement therapy
fairly widespread nowadays. people accomplish cream. pretty
well understood that, someone's taking want avoid contact anyone.
Skin contact anyone trying promote estrogenic activity body.

00:39:00 Environmental Endocrine Disruptors, Sperm Count Decline, Vincloziline

especially children. one. issue environmental factors.
Now this, know, just going highlight, one starts talking
environmental factors poisoning us disrupting growth fertility rates
can start sound little bit crazy. Except start actually look
real data, Data quality research labs funded Federal government funded, not
companies sources, really aimed understanding
underlying biology is. really, grateful Tyrone Hayes
UC Berkeley. remember way back graduate student late nineties,
goodness. UC Berkeley. remember him, studying frogs. talking
developmental defects frogs live different waters around
California, also elsewhere. identified substance, present lot
waterways throughout country countries. US beyond. Certainly not
just restricted California, atrazine. A-T-R-A-Z-I-N-E. Again,
stuff textbooks. causes severe testicular malformations. again, atrazine
exposure serious. interesting look data, find
sites Western Midwestern sections United States 10 92% male
frogs. frogs mind you, testicular abnormalities. severe
testicular malformations testes rather sperm. actually


organ itself, gonad itself. Now well known now atrazine many
herbicides. know, whereas say 80's 90's discussion
around herbicides negative effects considered kind like hippy-dippy stuff
stuff hear know, local community markets kind
new age communities. Now solid data, Federally funded labs major
universities peer reviewed published excellent journals, showing
indeed many herbicides can negative effects, primarily impacting
ratios hormones either mothers testes, altering testes
fathers direct effects developing young animals potentially humans.
ask, "Well, humans? Frogs wonderful, humans?"
data happening isn't going scary stuff.
also going talk tools ameliorate offset effects. One
be, cautious Evening Primrose well testosterone creams, depending
whether not want androgenic estrogenic depending needs.
across human populations, sperm counts indeed declining, okay? 1940,
average, average density human sperm 113 million per milliliter semen.
measured. many sperm per milliliter semen. 1990 figure
dropped 66. went 113 million per milliliter 66 million per milliliter
United States Western Europe. not just US thing. Researchers also
estimated volume semen produced men dropped 20% time,
reduced sperm count per generation even further. 1981 1991, ratio
normal spermatogenesis decreased 56.4% 26.9%. lot
happening primarily herbicides widespread use reduce
sperm counts. going profound effects not just sperm counts,
development, sexual development level gonads brain.
need testosterone get dihydrotestosterone primary sexual
characteristics. need estrogen come testosterone masculinize
brain. course, not just focusing sperm testosterone. course
also know many herbicides disrupting estrogens similar way.
leading hyper estrogenic, excuse me, states might explain puberty
happening much earlier young girls days. lot things
happening. Now mean run around neurotically avoid
anything includes things like atrazine avoiding kinds
herbicides? don't know you. seem pretty marked

testosterone don't receptors. receptors vitally
important some, secondary sexual characteristics talked
about. Body hair, penis growth puberty et cetera. live fairly happy lives

don't ovaries. also general, don't produce sperm quantities enough
actually reproduce somebody else, although sometimes can.
believe not, not going name names actually reports
several people, fairly prominent people throughout history androgen

exceedingly interesting revealing us many ways

00:48:41 Estrogen Establishes “Masculine” Brain Circuits, Testosterone

hormones can impact brain body. ways didn't suspect. Perhaps
simplest way understand estrogen testosterone impact masculinization

interesting. think just testosterone one thing estrogen


another,

00:49:42 Cannabis, Alcohol: Babies, Puberty & Adults

turns nature far interesting that. Okay,
things impact sexual development early life later life. talk
cannabis. talk alcohol dare say talk cell phones. Something
never thought ever do, either podcast classroom. But,
days really interesting data. think aware them. First
all, cannabis, marijuana, THC. realize now lot different variance
this. lot different strains cannabis. personally not pot smoker.
just not me. not talking moral legal implications, States
decriminalized, places really illegal places basically legal.
check, know live understand laws. not
about. know however, exception one study
many studies point fact THC things cannabis promote
significant increases aromatase activity. Now pot smokers aren't going like this,
especially male pot smokers aren't going like reality. Remember,
hearing background Costello snoring really loud? put
screen? not cannabis smoker, can imagine why. Come Costello.
Come buddy, come here. asleep. Come here. [indistinct],
go. dog definitely not need cannabis. state time.
highly... Oh asleep still. asked see Costello just
listening audio, maybe gives [Costello grunts] Oh, okay. going let
get back sleep. always here, asked see him. Costello's not
pot smoker either. dog sitter pot smoker years ago.
favorite dog sitter but, not pot smoker. Again, no judgment. deal.
cannabis, not clear THC elements marijuana plant,
promote aromatase activity. Now, observed anecdotally pot
smokers higher incidence developing something mentioned
gynecomastia, breast bud development. full-blown breast development males.
may women want increase estrogenic activity. Remember
females make testosterone. comes adrenals, right? don't testes.
comes adrenals testosterone can also aromatized. Although


typically aromatase activity referring examples
males. testosterone can increase estrogenic activity. might say, "Oh
know, therefore testosterone reduce sexual behavior? create sorts
things related low testosterone?" Not necessarily, not necessarily.
why, estrogen males females important things like libido sexual
behavior. going repeat that. estrogen low males, can actually inhibit
libido sexual behavior. don't want estrogen high low. Whether
not male female. Now course females, estrogen levels tend higher
males. speaking generally here. just think back chromosomal
sex. referring say male female, although nuance
course. females, testosterone comes adrenals
powerful effect libido desire reproduce. next episode, going
talk works relationship birth control, relationship
menopause. also going talk whole thing works males well.
cannabis aspects marijuana plant can impact levels testosterone
estrogen increasing aromatase. people aware that. well,
good data. able find several studies PubMed, pointing fact
smoking marijuana pregnancy can shift pattern hormones
developing fetus, promotes estrogenic outcomes. Now earlier said
estrogen masculinized male brain, utero true, way
cannabis seems work, least studies able identify
promotes circulating estrogen body therefore can counteract
masculinizing effects things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone, primary
secondary sexual characteristics. mention because, know think nowadays
marijuana use far widespread certainly puberty can profound
effects hormonal systems. another episode, goes really
deep this. yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity increasing aromatase.
Almost everyone can appreciate drinking pregnancy, not good
developing fetus. Fetal alcohol syndrome well-established negative outcome
pregnancy. something cognitive effects really bad.
actually physical malformation, et cetera. drinking pregnancy, not good.
Probably drinking puberty, not good either. alcohol, particular certain
things like beer grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity. Now, isn't
just protecting young boys estrogenic activity. also protecting girls


excessive even hypo estrogenic effects alcohol puberty. Now, many teenagers
drink. College students drink important point puberty doesn't start
one day end another day, puberty beginning middle end,
development really entire lifespan. idea know, puberty know
open close. just false.

00:56:25 Cell Phone Technology: Effects Hormones, Ovaries, & Testicles

Okay, talked cannabis. talked alcohol. talk cell
phones. First all, use cell phone. use often. not think evil
devices. think require discipline order make sure not
become negative force one's life. personally restrict number hours
phone particular social media. answer email particular
times day. cell phone itself? know, junior
professor. pre-tenure early professor. taught class neural circuits
health disease. one students asked me, know cell phones safe
brain? know, data point fact were. least
no data showing wasn't. still don't answer that, frankly.
don't see lot studies it. not personally aware evidence quality
peer reviewed studies showing cell phones bad brain holding
phone ear bad Bluetooth bad that. just not aware
quality studies. aware quality studies, peer reviewed study please reference
them, put comment section. Send me, however like. love
see them. not aware them. However, interested particular study
published back 2013 rats. basically took cell phone put
cage rats looked basically testicular ovarian development rats
saw minor still statistically significant defects ovarian testicular
development. Since now returning literature, seen absolute
explosion studies. quality journals,
call not blue ribbon journals. Identifying defects testicular ovarian
development mere exposure cell phone emitted waves. just call that, don't
know are. sounds almost crazy, right? Anytime somebody starts
talking EMS things like that, kind worry like, person okay?
look, literature pointing direction chronic exposure gonads


cell phones creating serious issues terms health cellular level
terms output. output testes sperm production.
Swimming speed sperm important feature sperm health. ovaries
estrogenic output. regular cycles are. animals, cycles
little bit different humans. don't menstrual cycle.
estrous cycle, generally around four days. think say based
literature, effects cell phone emitted waves gonadal development.
question is, proximity cell phone gonads? Now, taken
literature observe it. course point captions.
don't like cell phone pocket, well past puberty,
nonetheless effects seen adult animals. effects now
demonstrated humans. just talk couple
effects. paper published journal, "Clinical Biochemistry" S. Gander et al.
Looked hormone profiles people based proximity phone frequency
phone use, stored phone body. Aa well proximity
lived to, guess called radio-frequency towers. base stations.
looking effects radio frequency radiation RFR human hormone
profiles. show significant decreases cortisol. might say, "Well, might
good." need morning cortisol bump order wake up. Morning cortisol
good. also thyroid hormones significantly reduced. Prolactin young
females, definitely concerning testosterone levels males females.
so, now quite good data showing close phone much
day close interesting question living near one base stations
apparently can effects hormone profiles. see study like one
always ask, "Well, things also effects
hormone profiles?" Right? Cause imagine ran study
people live close waterway, close highway lot exhaust
buses cars, might see similar effects. take sorts
studies grain salt. think interesting. given last time
looked data way back junior professor like
one two studies find. One studies pointed increases
testosterone rats, close proximity radio-frequency
radiation waves. case, showed decreases testosterone.
really wasn't conclusion takeaway that. Now, pretty impressive


amount data pointing fact effects things hormones.
don't know information. not going stop using phone but,
light work Tyrone Hayes others looking sperm counts looking
decrease testosterone levels sperm counts fertility last 20, 30
years, perhaps know, not surprising. Although again, cell phones
smartphones really prominent use mostly within last 10 11 years.

01:02:33 Beards & Baldness Patterns Around World, DHT, 5-alpha-reductase

hard explain declines simply basis cell phone use.
interesting effects hormones actually can observe
outside people, tell something not just level hormones, also
underlying genetics. relate beard growth baldness.
fascinating. molecule, hormone dihydrotestosterone, made testosterone,
hormone primarily responsible facial hair, beard growth. well,
molecule, hormone primarily responsible lack hair head, hair loss.
work? Well, DHT circulates body binds DHT receptors
face promote hair growth. binds DHD receptors scalp promote
hair loss. Not incidentally, drugs designed prevent hair loss 5-alpha-
reductase inhibitors. remember 5-alpha-reductase Guevedoces? Well,
people discovered Güevedoces, went lot research
underlying biochemistry really interesting molecule dihydrotestosterone.
identified 5-alpha-reductase. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors basis
anti-hair loss treatments there. interesting things
here. First all, side effect profiles treatments hair loss quite severe
many individuals. Remember DHT primary androgen libido, strengthened
connective tissue repair, aggression. Even aggression course held
check, just sort ambition aggression related dopamine, within
testosterone pathway, less pure testosterone, although pure testosterone
effects. DHT is, least primate species including humans, dominant
androgen sorts effects. look somebody, everyone can
predict whether not going go bald based looking their, always
taught mother's father. mother's father bald, higher
probability going go bald. pattern DHT receptors scalp, will


dictate whether not going go bald everywhere just front
called crown type baldness. density beard tells density
DHT receptors. Now varies background, genetic background. actually
around world nowadays, people travel people form couples
kids many different people different mixed cultures. seeing starting
disappear. areas areas world men seem
pattern baldness, like strip baldness center, hair still
sides full beards. patterns DHT receptors
genetically determined. Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still high, DHT levels
blood can high yet people will light beards no beards.
don't lot DHT receptors face. still
cultures see people huge beard, tons beard. beards growing
way eyes huge heads hair.
lot DHT receptors face not scalp. lot
effects DHT can just see male phenotypes. interesting
hair loss drugs are, prevent hair loss drugs, directly aimed preventing
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone.
extent prevent hair loss, also extent have, bunch side effects
associated low DHT.

01:06:39 Creatine & DHT/Hair Loss

Along lines particular sports supplement lot people use called
Creatine. Creatine, now lot research showing Creatine can bring
water muscle. can support strength. number things.
Might even important cognitive promoting. Cognitive enhancement effects,
although mild. studies show can significant. people, not
anecdotal, report creatine promotes hair loss. differs individual.
people true, others no. yes appear, based studies able
find PubMed, creatine promote 5-alpha-reductase activity therefore
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone. makes sense
might promote degree hair loss, well beard growth, well
effects DHT. recall junior high school middle school, going home one Summer
seventh grade, coming back eighth grade kid knew


friends with, went like young kid to, like grown man, full
beard. amazing. like completely transformed. puberty
said before, without doubt accelerated rate development will
go point lives. Even faster infancy just terms huge
number different cognitive changes physical changes. Not surprisingly
individual mostly bald early twenties. must
just exceedingly high levels DHT. also played soccer kid
basically like dribbling past everybody. like grown man, playing soccer
bunch little kids.

01:08:20 Predicting Aging Rates Pubertal Rates

Full beard know, bald 20. rate maturation, rate aging
interesting. hard know rate aging. genetic tests now can allow
that. Things like Horvath Clocks things sort. Beautiful work David
Sinclair Harvard others pointed this. speed entry exit
puberty might be, putting hypothesis. Might interesting
window, fast one going aging developmental arc.
development course, doesn't just start birth end puberty. continues
entire life. think interesting. will often see people, boys girls.
say boys girls, will develop secondary sexual characteristics different rates.
sometimes sequential. know might see kid will, grow tall
big growth spurt, breast development will come little bit later.
features will come little bit later. can also see boys.
person referred earlier, friend developed full beard, know, went
bald. also quite muscular, great athlete. went puberty
exceedingly fast. people go slowly. people will go
puberty age 14, won't start accumulate facial hair much, much later.
voice will change first, early. won't get secondary
sexual characteristics much later. so, don't really know impacts
relates overall trajectory rate aging. interesting thing think
every one us. going offer opportunity experiment
today,



01:10:04 Hyenas, Baseball, & Hypertrophied Clitorises: Androstenedione

listening podcast. first want tell story hyenas,
professional baseball clitoris's size penises. graduate
student UC Berkeley, professor department, phenomenal scientist
named Steve Glickman. Steve Glickman, colony hyenas, spotted hyenas
lived, within caged enclosures course, Tilden Park behind UC Berkeley campus.
enclosures actually still there. run past fairly often. hyenas no
longer there. Federally Funded field station. animals brought
Africa bred there. reason hyenas Tilden
Park, enclosed Tilden Park. hyenas exhibit incredible feature
body, hormones social structure. Hyenas, unlike many species,
situation genitalia male penis actually smaller female
clitoris. say male penis itself, seen fair number hyena
penises, not particularly small. means hyena clitoris's extremely
large. well known time. turns spotted hyenas
females dominant. kill females will eat, young will eat.
male hyenas will eat. well, female hyena gives birth, gives
birth, not vaginal canal accustomed seeing,
enlarged clitoris's like phallus. Although not phallus, clitoris. literally
splits open. many fetuses die course hyena development birth.
animals this, described large giant clitoris.
Although hyena not giant, normal. splits open baby actually
comes through. baby hyena actually comes tissue
traumatic birth. lot tissue torn away, et cetera. mentioned, lot baby
hyenas die. mystery female hyenas call
masculinization, really androgen jet. Excuse me, androgenization

00:14:15 Hormones Basics

start talking hormones just remind do.
Hormones definition, substance, chemical released one area
body. Typically something call gland, although can also released
neurons. released often glands, travel effects
gland also organs tissues body. differentiates hormones
things like neurotransmitters, tend act locally. important.
hormone substance secreted one location body, travels, impact
things elsewhere body. Examples tissues produce hormones
thyroid, testes, ovaries et cetera. course areas brain
like hypothalamus pituitary, closely related one another
release hormones cause release yet hormones body.
going cover this. don't know anything endocrinology, still
going able understand today's discussion. going start
discussion about, hormones actually do,

brain will call organized masculine organized feminine. say this,
want try discard cultural connotations psychological
connotations, masculinization feminization are.
centering biology. typically, people either two X chromosomes,


traditional language around person female, right? X chromosome
Y chromosome person will become male. Now not always case.
cases XXY, two X chromosomes plus Y
chromosome. also cases XYY. two Y chromosomes.
important biological psychological impacts. first thing
need establish something called chromosomal sex. Whether not
two X chromosomes, X Y chromosome, call chromosomal
sex. next stage separating sexes, call gonadal sex.
Typically not always, typically somebody testes gonads, think
male. somebody ovaries, think female. Although
not always case either. just explore transition chromosomal sex
gonadal sex, fascinating one went form
another. XY typically think

genes like SRY gene genes promote formation testes,
also inhibit formation Mullerian Ducts. transition

00:21:04 Hormones Fast & Slow, Sex Steroids Can Turn Genes

regardless chromosomal background. get started that. talk little bit
hormones do. Hormones generally two categories effects.
can either fast can slow. hormones like cortisol
adrenaline, act fast. Adrenaline can increase heart rate fast
secreted body. Cortisol can little bit slower, also can


fast effects. hormones like. Like testosterone estrogen,
refer sex steroid hormones. sex steroid hormones can
quick effects signaling. Meaning can attach cells make cells
different things. can actually quite quick effects brain. lot
people don't know this, fast effects estrogen testosterone
well long-term effects. molecules, interested,
called lipophilic. just means like fatty stuff, can actually pass
fatty membranes. outside cells, well called
nuclear envelope. DNA contents stuff stuffed inside, made
lipid, fat. steroid hormones can actually travel cells get
DNA. Basically interact DNA cells order control gene expression.
can change sorts things cells will become can change way
cells function long-term way. actually presence
genes like SRY Mullerian inhibiting hormone, lead reductions elimination
say, things like Mullerian Ducts promote instead called males
Wolffian Ducts. promote development testes rather ovaries.
need know hormones short-term long-term effects. long-term
effects actually related effects genes genes expressed
repressed, order prevent particular proteins made.

00:23:06 Masculinization, Feminization, Demasculinization, Defeminization

hormones, steroid hormones exceedingly powerful.
going discussion masculinization feminization et cetera, also
need think counterpart. not just masculinizing body
feminizing body brain, also demasculinize brain many cases,
normal biological function typically XX females. de feminization,

just not me. not talking moral legal implications, States
decriminalized, places really illegal places basically legal.
check, know live understand laws. not

gynecomastia, breast bud development. full-blown breast development males.
may women want increase estrogenic activity. Remember
females make testosterone. comes adrenals, right? don't testes.
comes adrenals testosterone can also aromatized. Although


typically aromatase activity referring examples
males. testosterone can increase estrogenic activity. might say, "Oh
know, therefore testosterone reduce sexual behavior? create sorts
things related low testosterone?" Not necessarily, not necessarily.
why, estrogen males females important things like libido sexual
behavior. going repeat that. estrogen low males, can actually inhibit
libido sexual behavior. don't want estrogen high low. Whether
not male female. Now course females, estrogen levels tend higher
males. speaking generally here. just think back chromosomal
sex. referring say male female, although nuance
course. females, testosterone comes adrenals
powerful effect libido desire reproduce. next episode, going
talk works relationship birth control, relationship
menopause. also going talk whole thing works males well.
cannabis aspects marijuana plant can impact levels testosterone
estrogen increasing aromatase. people aware that. well,
good data. able find several studies PubMed, pointing fact
smoking marijuana pregnancy can shift pattern hormones
developing fetus, promotes estrogenic outcomes. Now earlier said
estrogen masculinized male brain, utero true, way
cannabis seems work, least studies able identify
promotes circulating estrogen body therefore can counteract
masculinizing effects things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone, primary
secondary sexual characteristics. mention because, know think nowadays
marijuana use far widespread certainly puberty can profound
effects hormonal systems. another episode, goes really
deep this. yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity increasing aromatase.
Almost everyone can appreciate drinking pregnancy, not good
developing fetus. Fetal alcohol syndrome well-established negative outcome
pregnancy. something cognitive effects really bad.
actually physical malformation, et cetera. drinking pregnancy, not good.
Probably drinking puberty, not good either. alcohol, particular certain
things like beer grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity. Now, isn't
just protecting young boys estrogenic activity. also protecting girls


excessive even hypo estrogenic effects alcohol puberty. Now, many teenagers
drink. College students drink important point puberty doesn't start
one day end another day, puberty beginning middle end,
development really entire lifespan. idea know, puberty know
open close. just false.

00:56:25 Cell Phone Technology: Effects Hormones, Ovaries, & Testicles

Okay, talked cannabis. talked alcohol. talk cell
phones. First all, use cell phone. use often. not think evil
devices. think require discipline order make sure not
become negative force one's life. personally restrict number hours
phone particular social media. answer email particular
times day. cell phone itself? know, junior
professor. pre-tenure early professor. taught class neural circuits
health disease. one students asked me, know cell phones safe
brain? know, data point fact were. least
no data showing wasn't. still don't answer that, frankly.
don't see lot studies it. not personally aware evidence quality
peer reviewed studies showing cell phones bad brain holding
phone ear bad Bluetooth bad that. just not aware
quality studies. aware quality studies, peer reviewed study please reference
them, put comment section. Send me, however like. love
see them. not aware them. However, interested particular study
published back 2013 rats. basically took cell phone put
cage rats looked basically testicular ovarian development rats
saw minor still statistically significant defects ovarian testicular
development. Since now returning literature, seen absolute
explosion studies. quality journals,
call not blue ribbon journals. Identifying defects testicular ovarian
development mere exposure cell phone emitted waves. just call that, don't
know are. sounds almost crazy, right? Anytime somebody starts
talking EMS things like that, kind worry like, person okay?
look, literature pointing direction chronic exposure gonads


cell phones creating serious issues terms health cellular level
terms output. output testes sperm production.
Swimming speed sperm important feature sperm health. ovaries
estrogenic output. regular cycles are. animals, cycles
little bit different humans. don't menstrual cycle.
estrous cycle, generally around four days. think say based
literature, effects cell phone emitted waves gonadal development.
question is, proximity cell phone gonads? Now, taken
literature observe it. course point captions.
don't like cell phone pocket, well past puberty,
nonetheless effects seen adult animals. effects now
demonstrated humans. just talk couple
effects. paper published journal, "Clinical Biochemistry" S. Gander et al.
Looked hormone profiles people based proximity phone frequency
phone use, stored phone body. Aa well proximity
lived to, guess called radio-frequency towers. base stations.
looking effects radio frequency radiation RFR human hormone
profiles. show significant decreases cortisol. might say, "Well, might
good." need morning cortisol bump order wake up. Morning cortisol
good. also thyroid hormones significantly reduced. Prolactin young
females, definitely concerning testosterone levels males females.
so, now quite good data showing close phone much
day close interesting question living near one base stations
apparently can effects hormone profiles. see study like one
always ask, "Well, things also effects
hormone profiles?" Right? Cause imagine ran study
people live close waterway, close highway lot exhaust
buses cars, might see similar effects. take sorts
studies grain salt. think interesting. given last time
looked data way back junior professor like
one two studies find. One studies pointed increases
testosterone rats, close proximity radio-frequency
radiation waves. case, showed decreases testosterone.
really wasn't conclusion takeaway that. Now, pretty impressive


amount data pointing fact effects things hormones.
don't know information. not going stop using phone but,
light work Tyrone Hayes others looking sperm counts looking
decrease testosterone levels sperm counts fertility last 20, 30
years, perhaps know, not surprising. Although again, cell phones
smartphones really prominent use mostly within last 10 11 years.

01:02:33 Beards & Baldness Patterns Around World, DHT, 5-alpha-reductase

hard explain declines simply basis cell phone use.
interesting effects hormones actually can observe
outside people, tell something not just level hormones, also
underlying genetics. relate beard growth baldness.
fascinating. molecule, hormone dihydrotestosterone, made testosterone,
hormone primarily responsible facial hair, beard growth. well,
molecule, hormone primarily responsible lack hair head, hair loss.
work? Well, DHT circulates body binds DHT receptors
face promote hair growth. binds DHD receptors scalp promote
hair loss. Not incidentally, drugs designed prevent hair loss 5-alpha-
reductase inhibitors. remember 5-alpha-reductase Guevedoces? Well,
people discovered Güevedoces, went lot research
underlying biochemistry really interesting molecule dihydrotestosterone.
identified 5-alpha-reductase. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors basis
anti-hair loss treatments there. interesting things
here. First all, side effect profiles treatments hair loss quite severe
many individuals. Remember DHT primary androgen libido, strengthened
connective tissue repair, aggression. Even aggression course held
check, just sort ambition aggression related dopamine, within
testosterone pathway, less pure testosterone, although pure testosterone
effects. DHT is, least primate species including humans, dominant
androgen sorts effects. look somebody, everyone can
predict whether not going go bald based looking their, always
taught mother's father. mother's father bald, higher
probability going go bald. pattern DHT receptors scalp, will


dictate whether not going go bald everywhere just front
called crown type baldness. density beard tells density
DHT receptors. Now varies background, genetic background. actually
around world nowadays, people travel people form couples
kids many different people different mixed cultures. seeing starting
disappear. areas areas world men seem
pattern baldness, like strip baldness center, hair still
sides full beards. patterns DHT receptors
genetically determined. Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still high, DHT levels
blood can high yet people will light beards no beards.
don't lot DHT receptors face. still
cultures see people huge beard, tons beard. beards growing
way eyes huge heads hair.
lot DHT receptors face not scalp. lot
effects DHT can just see male phenotypes. interesting
hair loss drugs are, prevent hair loss drugs, directly aimed preventing
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone.
extent prevent hair loss, also extent have, bunch side effects
associated low DHT.

01:06:39 Creatine & DHT/Hair Loss

Along lines particular sports supplement lot people use called
Creatine. Creatine, now lot research showing Creatine can bring
water muscle. can support strength. number things.
Might even important cognitive promoting. Cognitive enhancement effects,
although mild. studies show can significant. people, not
anecdotal, report creatine promotes hair loss. differs individual.
people true, others no. yes appear, based studies able
find PubMed, creatine promote 5-alpha-reductase activity therefore
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone. makes sense
might promote degree hair loss, well beard growth, well
effects DHT. recall junior high school middle school, going home one Summer
seventh grade, coming back eighth grade kid knew


friends with, went like young kid to, like grown man, full
beard. amazing. like completely transformed. puberty
said before, without doubt accelerated rate development will
go point lives. Even faster infancy just terms huge
number different cognitive changes physical changes. Not surprisingly
individual mostly bald early twenties. must
just exceedingly high levels DHT. also played soccer kid
basically like dribbling past everybody. like grown man, playing soccer
bunch little kids.

01:08:20 Predicting Aging Rates Pubertal Rates

Full beard know, bald 20. rate maturation, rate aging
interesting. hard know rate aging. genetic tests now can allow
that. Things like Horvath Clocks things sort. Beautiful work David
Sinclair Harvard others pointed this. speed entry exit
puberty might be, putting hypothesis. Might interesting
window, fast one going aging developmental arc.
development course, doesn't just start birth end puberty. continues
entire life. think interesting. will often see people, boys girls.
say boys girls, will develop secondary sexual characteristics different rates.
sometimes sequential. know might see kid will, grow tall
big growth spurt, breast development will come little bit later.
features will come little bit later. can also see boys.
person referred earlier, friend developed full beard, know, went
bald. also quite muscular, great athlete. went puberty
exceedingly fast. people go slowly. people will go
puberty age 14, won't start accumulate facial hair much, much later.
voice will change first, early. won't get secondary
sexual characteristics much later. so, don't really know impacts
relates overall trajectory rate aging. interesting thing think
every one us. going offer opportunity experiment
today,

00:49:42 Cannabis, Alcohol: Babies, Puberty & Adults

turns nature far interesting that. Okay,
things impact sexual development early life later life. talk
cannabis. talk alcohol dare say talk cell phones. Something
never thought ever do, either podcast classroom. But,
days really interesting data. think aware them. First
all, cannabis, marijuana, THC. realize now lot different variance
this. lot different strains cannabis. personally not pot smoker.
just not me. not talking moral legal implications, States
decriminalized, places really illegal places basically legal.
check, know live understand laws. not
about. know however, exception one study
many studies point fact THC things cannabis promote
significant increases aromatase activity. Now pot smokers aren't going like this,
especially male pot smokers aren't going like reality. Remember,
hearing background Costello snoring really loud? put
screen? not cannabis smoker, can imagine why. Come Costello.
Come buddy, come here. asleep. Come here. [indistinct],
go. dog definitely not need cannabis. state time.
highly... Oh asleep still. asked see Costello just
listening audio, maybe gives [Costello grunts] Oh, okay. going let
get back sleep. always here, asked see him. Costello's not
pot smoker either. dog sitter pot smoker years ago.
favorite dog sitter but, not pot smoker. Again, no judgment. deal.
cannabis, not clear THC elements marijuana plant,
promote aromatase activity. Now, observed anecdotally pot
smokers higher incidence developing something mentioned
gynecomastia, breast bud development. full-blown breast development males.
may women want increase estrogenic activity. Remember
females make testosterone. comes adrenals, right? don't testes.
comes adrenals testosterone can also aromatized. Although


typically aromatase activity referring examples
males. testosterone can increase estrogenic activity. might say, "Oh
know, therefore testosterone reduce sexual behavior? create sorts
things related low testosterone?" Not necessarily, not necessarily.
why, estrogen males females important things like libido sexual
behavior. going repeat that. estrogen low males, can actually inhibit
libido sexual behavior. don't want estrogen high low. Whether
not male female. Now course females, estrogen levels tend higher
males. speaking generally here. just think back chromosomal
sex. referring say male female, although nuance
course. females, testosterone comes adrenals
powerful effect libido desire reproduce. next episode, going
talk works relationship birth control, relationship
menopause. also going talk whole thing works males well.
cannabis aspects marijuana plant can impact levels testosterone
estrogen increasing aromatase. people aware that. well,
good data. able find several studies PubMed, pointing fact
smoking marijuana pregnancy can shift pattern hormones
developing fetus, promotes estrogenic outcomes. Now earlier said
estrogen masculinized male brain, utero true, way
cannabis seems work, least studies able identify
promotes circulating estrogen body therefore can counteract
masculinizing effects things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone, primary
secondary sexual characteristics. mention because, know think nowadays
marijuana use far widespread certainly puberty can profound
effects hormonal systems. another episode, goes really
deep this. yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity increasing aromatase.
Almost everyone can appreciate drinking pregnancy, not good
developing fetus. Fetal alcohol syndrome well-established negative outcome
pregnancy. something cognitive effects really bad.
actually physical malformation, et cetera. drinking pregnancy, not good.
Probably drinking puberty, not good either. alcohol, particular certain
things like beer grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity. Now, isn't
just protecting young boys estrogenic activity. also protecting girls


excessive even hypo estrogenic effects alcohol puberty. Now, many teenagers
drink. College students drink important point puberty doesn't start
one day end another day, puberty beginning middle end,
development really entire lifespan. idea know, puberty know
open close. just false.

00:56:25 Cell Phone Technology: Effects Hormones, Ovaries, & Testicles

Okay, talked cannabis. talked alcohol. talk cell
phones. First all, use cell phone. use often. not think evil
devices. think require discipline order make sure not
become negative force one's life. personally restrict number hours
phone particular social media. answer email particular
times day. cell phone itself? know, junior
professor. pre-tenure early professor. taught class neural circuits
health disease. one students asked me, know cell phones safe
brain? know, data point fact were. least
no data showing wasn't. still don't answer that, frankly.
don't see lot studies it. not personally aware evidence quality
peer reviewed studies showing cell phones bad brain holding
phone ear bad Bluetooth bad that. just not aware
quality studies. aware quality studies, peer reviewed study please reference
them, put comment section. Send me, however like. love
see them. not aware them. However, interested particular study
published back 2013 rats. basically took cell phone put
cage rats looked basically testicular ovarian development rats
saw minor still statistically significant defects ovarian testicular
development. Since now returning literature, seen absolute
explosion studies. quality journals,
call not blue ribbon journals. Identifying defects testicular ovarian
development mere exposure cell phone emitted waves. just call that, don't
know are. sounds almost crazy, right? Anytime somebody starts
talking EMS things like that, kind worry like, person okay?
look, literature pointing direction chronic exposure gonads


cell phones creating serious issues terms health cellular level
terms output. output testes sperm production.
Swimming speed sperm important feature sperm health. ovaries
estrogenic output. regular cycles are. animals, cycles
little bit different humans. don't menstrual cycle.
estrous cycle, generally around four days. think say based
literature, effects cell phone emitted waves gonadal development.
question is, proximity cell phone gonads? Now, taken
literature observe it. course point captions.
don't like cell phone pocket, well past puberty,
nonetheless effects seen adult animals. effects now
demonstrated humans. just talk couple
effects. paper published journal, "Clinical Biochemistry" S. Gander et al.
Looked hormone profiles people based proximity phone frequency
phone use, stored phone body. Aa well proximity
lived to, guess called radio-frequency towers. base stations.
looking effects radio frequency radiation RFR human hormone
profiles. show significant decreases cortisol. might say, "Well, might
good." need morning cortisol bump order wake up. Morning cortisol
good. also thyroid hormones significantly reduced. Prolactin young
females, definitely concerning testosterone levels males females.
so, now quite good data showing close phone much
day close interesting question living near one base stations
apparently can effects hormone profiles. see study like one
always ask, "Well, things also effects
hormone profiles?" Right? Cause imagine ran study
people live close waterway, close highway lot exhaust
buses cars, might see similar effects. take sorts
studies grain salt. think interesting. given last time
looked data way back junior professor like
one two studies find. One studies pointed increases
testosterone rats, close proximity radio-frequency
radiation waves. case, showed decreases testosterone.
really wasn't conclusion takeaway that. Now, pretty impressive


amount data pointing fact effects things hormones.
don't know information. not going stop using phone but,
light work Tyrone Hayes others looking sperm counts looking
decrease testosterone levels sperm counts fertility last 20, 30
years, perhaps know, not surprising. Although again, cell phones
smartphones really prominent use mostly within last 10 11 years.

01:02:33 Beards & Baldness Patterns Around World, DHT, 5-alpha-reductase

hard explain declines simply basis cell phone use.
interesting effects hormones actually can observe
outside people, tell something not just level hormones, also
underlying genetics. relate beard growth baldness.
fascinating. molecule, hormone dihydrotestosterone, made testosterone,
hormone primarily responsible facial hair, beard growth. well,
molecule, hormone primarily responsible lack hair head, hair loss.
work? Well, DHT circulates body binds DHT receptors
face promote hair growth. binds DHD receptors scalp promote
hair loss. Not incidentally, drugs designed prevent hair loss 5-alpha-
reductase inhibitors. remember 5-alpha-reductase Guevedoces? Well,
people discovered Güevedoces, went lot research
underlying biochemistry really interesting molecule dihydrotestosterone.
identified 5-alpha-reductase. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors basis
anti-hair loss treatments there. interesting things
here. First all, side effect profiles treatments hair loss quite severe
many individuals. Remember DHT primary androgen libido, strengthened
connective tissue repair, aggression. Even aggression course held
check, just sort ambition aggression related dopamine, within
testosterone pathway, less pure testosterone, although pure testosterone
effects. DHT is, least primate species including humans, dominant
androgen sorts effects. look somebody, everyone can
predict whether not going go bald based looking their, always
taught mother's father. mother's father bald, higher
probability going go bald. pattern DHT receptors scalp, will


dictate whether not going go bald everywhere just front
called crown type baldness. density beard tells density
DHT receptors. Now varies background, genetic background. actually
around world nowadays, people travel people form couples
kids many different people different mixed cultures. seeing starting
disappear. areas areas world men seem
pattern baldness, like strip baldness center, hair still
sides full beards. patterns DHT receptors
genetically determined. Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still high, DHT levels
blood can high yet people will light beards no beards.
don't lot DHT receptors face. still
cultures see people huge beard, tons beard. beards growing
way eyes huge heads hair.
lot DHT receptors face not scalp. lot
effects DHT can just see male phenotypes. interesting
hair loss drugs are, prevent hair loss drugs, directly aimed preventing
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone.
extent prevent hair loss, also extent have, bunch side effects
associated low DHT.

01:06:39 Creatine & DHT/Hair Loss

Along lines particular sports supplement lot people use called
Creatine. Creatine, now lot research showing Creatine can bring
water muscle. can support strength. number things.
Might even important cognitive promoting. Cognitive enhancement effects,
although mild. studies show can significant. people, not
anecdotal, report creatine promotes hair loss. differs individual.
people true, others no. yes appear, based studies able
find PubMed, creatine promote 5-alpha-reductase activity therefore
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone. makes sense
might promote degree hair loss, well beard growth, well
effects DHT. recall junior high school middle school, going home one Summer
seventh grade, coming back eighth grade kid knew


friends with, went like young kid to, like grown man, full
beard. amazing. like completely transformed. puberty
said before, without doubt accelerated rate development will
go point lives. Even faster infancy just terms huge
number different cognitive changes physical changes. Not surprisingly
individual mostly bald early twenties. must
just exceedingly high levels DHT. also played soccer kid
basically like dribbling past everybody. like grown man, playing soccer
bunch little kids.

01:08:20 Predicting Aging Rates Pubertal Rates

Full beard know, bald 20. rate maturation, rate aging
interesting. hard know rate aging. genetic tests now can allow
that. Things like Horvath Clocks things sort. Beautiful work David
Sinclair Harvard others pointed this. speed entry exit
puberty might be, putting hypothesis. Might interesting
window, fast one going aging developmental arc.
development course, doesn't just start birth end puberty. continues
entire life. think interesting. will often see people, boys girls.
say boys girls, will develop secondary sexual characteristics different rates.
sometimes sequential. know might see kid will, grow tall
big growth spurt, breast development will come little bit later.
features will come little bit later. can also see boys.
person referred earlier, friend developed full beard, know, went
bald. also quite muscular, great athlete. went puberty
exceedingly fast. people go slowly. people will go
puberty age 14, won't start accumulate facial hair much, much later.
voice will change first, early. won't get secondary
sexual characteristics much later. so, don't really know impacts
relates overall trajectory rate aging. interesting thing think
every one us. going offer opportunity experiment

hasn't lot studies yet. One thing interesting,
good scientific data also controversy that, appears
probability male human self-reporting homosexual, increases

00:21:04 Hormones Fast & Slow, Sex Steroids Can Turn Genes

regardless chromosomal background. get started that. talk little bit
hormones do. Hormones generally two categories effects.
can either fast can slow. hormones like cortisol
adrenaline, act fast. Adrenaline can increase heart rate fast
secreted body. Cortisol can little bit slower, also can


fast effects. hormones like. Like testosterone estrogen,
refer sex steroid hormones. sex steroid hormones can
quick effects signaling. Meaning can attach cells make cells

really fascinating twists story.

00:23:42 Primary Sexual Characteristics: DHT Drives Penis Development

just thrown lot biology you, starts get incredibly
surprising. think straightforward, right? Y chromosome


suppress female reproductive pathway like Mullerian Ducts. promote
development testes testes make testosterone. organizes
brain male wants male like things. females get estrogen
wants female like things. air quotes this. turns isn't
works all. interesting. understand

comes role testosterone creating external genitalia. Now
might think just straight forward. testes, 'cause Y chromosome.
know, got gene codes development testes, get

00:31:25 Estrogen, NOT Testosterone, Masculinizes Brain

deepening voice, et cetera. Now information gets even
interesting applies essentially everybody. might think testosterone
masculinizes body secondary sexual characteristic way.
dihydrotestosterone another androgen, masculinizes primary sexual
characteristics. growth penis early on, testosterone must masculinize
brain. fact aspects masculinization brain body,
independent genitalia. Now might obvious you, people
probably don't realize that. Yes indeed brain receptors testosterone. also
receptors estrogen. fascinating thing look brains
people Y chromosomes testes make testosterone,
look brains people don't Y chromosomes testes therefore


make far less testosterone general, realize cells brain
differ call males females, XY, XX receptors
testosterone, masculinization brain not accomplished
testosterone. want repeat this. masculinization brain not accomplished

dihydrotestosterone. just want mention tools. might asking yourself,
"How tools possibly come stage conversation talking
sexual development talking differentiation tissues
body." Well, true children parents adults. want emphasize
things environmental things people use
homes sometimes actually can impact hormone levels can impact sexual
development fairly profound ways. want clear, not pulling
rare journal never heard it. pulling textbooks.
particular, today guiding lot conversation work "Behavioral
Endocrinology," book Randy Nelson Lance Kriegsfeld. True experts
field. going talk work Tyrone Hayes UC Berkeley
environmental toxins impacts things like testosterone
estrogen. going touch them. going give anecdotal evidence
grounded studies, will provide caption reference here.
One actually really interesting helps illustrate principle
talking is. years ago, lot excitement Evening
Primrose Oil. Evening Primrose Oil lot products typically associated
skin beauty skin health. generalizing here. typically
mothers sisters using it. actually examples starting crop
young boys getting accelerated breast bud development skin contact
women using Evening Primrose Oil. Evening Primrose Oil chemically lot
like estrogen lot estrogenic compounds. number things
like this. believe not things like pine pollen look much like testosterone
structurally. less testosterone. bioavailability humans isn't
clear. Evening Primrose Oil lot estrogenic elements it. Just structurally
built. cases boys understandably know,
hugged mom maybe even like showering taking. know using
Evening Primrose Oil solution. things will actually change levels estrogens


boys girls. wasn't just issue young boys. also issue
young girls. not Evening Primrose Oil bad, just many
probably heard dangers Soy Isoflavones things like that.
impact soy estrogen levels is, decent evidence support that.
However, lot factors severe. one
Evening Primrose Oil. regardless age, just put way people
might wanting drive hormones estrogenic androgenic.
know preference is? don't know. case, things like
pre Evening Primrose Oil can actually promote estrogenic pathways body
can go transdermal. Likewise, testosterone replacement therapy
fairly widespread nowadays. people accomplish cream. pretty
well understood that, someone's taking want avoid contact anyone.
Skin contact anyone trying promote estrogenic activity body.

00:39:00 Environmental Endocrine Disruptors, Sperm Count Decline, Vincloziline

especially children. one. issue environmental factors.
Now this, know, just going highlight, one starts talking
environmental factors poisoning us disrupting growth fertility rates
can start sound little bit crazy. Except start actually look
real data, Data quality research labs funded Federal government funded, not
companies sources, really aimed understanding
underlying biology is. really, grateful Tyrone Hayes
UC Berkeley. remember way back graduate student late nineties,
goodness. UC Berkeley. remember him, studying frogs. talking
developmental defects frogs live different waters around
California, also elsewhere. identified substance, present lot
waterways throughout country countries. US beyond. Certainly not
just restricted California, atrazine. A-T-R-A-Z-I-N-E. Again,
stuff textbooks. causes severe testicular malformations. again, atrazine
exposure serious. interesting look data, find
sites Western Midwestern sections United States 10 92% male
frogs. frogs mind you, testicular abnormalities. severe
testicular malformations testes rather sperm. actually


organ itself, gonad itself. Now well known now atrazine many
herbicides. know, whereas say 80's 90's discussion
around herbicides negative effects considered kind like hippy-dippy stuff
stuff hear know, local community markets kind
new age communities. Now solid data, Federally funded labs major
universities peer reviewed published excellent journals, showing
indeed many herbicides can negative effects, primarily impacting
ratios hormones either mothers testes, altering testes
fathers direct effects developing young animals potentially humans.
ask, "Well, humans? Frogs wonderful, humans?"
data happening isn't going scary stuff.
also going talk tools ameliorate offset effects. One
be, cautious Evening Primrose well testosterone creams, depending
whether not want androgenic estrogenic depending needs.
across human populations, sperm counts indeed declining, okay? 1940,
average, average density human sperm 113 million per milliliter semen.
measured. many sperm per milliliter semen. 1990 figure
dropped 66. went 113 million per milliliter 66 million per milliliter
United States Western Europe. not just US thing. Researchers also
estimated volume semen produced men dropped 20% time,
reduced sperm count per generation even further. 1981 1991, ratio
normal spermatogenesis decreased 56.4% 26.9%. lot
happening primarily herbicides widespread use reduce
sperm counts. going profound effects not just sperm counts,
development, sexual development level gonads brain.
need testosterone get dihydrotestosterone primary sexual
characteristics. need estrogen come testosterone masculinize
brain. course, not just focusing sperm testosterone. course
also know many herbicides disrupting estrogens similar way.
leading hyper estrogenic, excuse me, states might explain puberty
happening much earlier young girls days. lot things
happening. Now mean run around neurotically avoid
anything includes things like atrazine avoiding kinds
herbicides? don't know you. seem pretty marked


effects, animal studies human studies. know, can open
textbook like endocrinology textbook find things like Vinclozolin. V-I-N-C-L-O-

report feeling like girls young, women older.
something unusual happening individuals XY

testes making testosterone, receptor testosterone mutated.
therefore testes never descend. don't ovaries, testes
testes internal. typically individuals find actually XY
chromosomes. know, chromosomal sex male. will.
gonadal sex male, gonads, testes inside body. don't actually
develop scrotum. don't make ovaries. don't menstruate around
time puberty sign something different. never
menstruate around puberty. look deeply enough, find
actually XY. make testosterone body can't make use
testosterone don't receptors. receptors vitally
important some, secondary sexual characteristics talked
about. Body hair, penis growth puberty et cetera. live fairly happy lives
females. Although course can't conceive, right? don't uterus,


don't ovaries. also general, don't produce sperm quantities enough
actually reproduce somebody else, although sometimes can.
believe not, not going name names actually reports
several people, fairly prominent people throughout history androgen
insensitivity syndrome people suspected did. reason not name names
that, gets right heart whether not male female.
say right? XY chromosomes gonadally testes inside.
yet, looked bodies looked faces, say almost
certainty appeared female. naturally occurring experiment, points
fact testosterone shows body impacts things
levels receptor profound effect phenotype. external body plan.
again, talking order illustrate principle order
effects, hormone doesn't just present. hormone actually
able bind receptor take action target cells. again, just throw
example people using performance enhancing drugs. Although
pretty broad statement, nowadays lot excitement so-called
SARMs. receptor side. talk future
episode. just say teaser SARMs happening right
now augmenting sports performance, testosterone directly also
testosterone derivatives also altering things level receptor
exceedingly interesting revealing us many ways

00:48:41 Estrogen Establishes “Masculine” Brain Circuits, Testosterone

hormones can impact brain body. ways didn't suspect. Perhaps
simplest way understand estrogen testosterone impact masculinization
feminization brain behavior statement. actually closing
sentence abstract colleague Neuronal Shaw Stanford school
medicine published. estrogen, estrogen aromatized
testosterone aromatase, sets masculine repertoire sexual, animals
humans, territorial behaviors. sets circuitry brain. Estrogen
that. Estrogen sets masculine circuitry brain testosterone
controls display behaviors later life. find incredibly
interesting. think just testosterone one thing estrogen


another,

00:49:42 Cannabis, Alcohol: Babies, Puberty & Adults

turns nature far interesting that. Okay,
things impact sexual development early life later life. talk
cannabis. talk alcohol dare say talk cell phones. Something
never thought ever do, either podcast classroom. But,
days really interesting data. think aware them. First
all, cannabis, marijuana, THC. realize now lot different variance
this. lot different strains cannabis. personally not pot smoker.
just not me. not talking moral legal implications, States
decriminalized, places really illegal places basically legal.
check, know live understand laws. not
about. know however, exception one study
many studies point fact THC things cannabis promote
significant increases aromatase activity. Now pot smokers aren't going like this,
especially male pot smokers aren't going like reality. Remember,
hearing background Costello snoring really loud? put
screen? not cannabis smoker, can imagine why. Come Costello.
Come buddy, come here. asleep. Come here. [indistinct],
go. dog definitely not need cannabis. state time.
highly... Oh asleep still. asked see Costello just
listening audio, maybe gives [Costello grunts] Oh, okay. going let
get back sleep. always here, asked see him. Costello's not
pot smoker either. dog sitter pot smoker years ago.
favorite dog sitter but, not pot smoker. Again, no judgment. deal.
cannabis, not clear THC elements marijuana plant,
promote aromatase activity. Now, observed anecdotally pot
smokers higher incidence developing something mentioned
gynecomastia, breast bud development. full-blown breast development males.
may women want increase estrogenic activity. Remember
females make testosterone. comes adrenals, right? don't testes.
comes adrenals testosterone can also aromatized. Although


typically aromatase activity referring examples
males. testosterone can increase estrogenic activity. might say, "Oh
know, therefore testosterone reduce sexual behavior? create sorts
things related low testosterone?" Not necessarily, not necessarily.
why, estrogen males females important things like libido sexual
behavior. going repeat that. estrogen low males, can actually inhibit
libido sexual behavior. don't want estrogen high low. Whether
not male female. Now course females, estrogen levels tend higher
males. speaking generally here. just think back chromosomal
sex. referring say male female, although nuance
course. females, testosterone comes adrenals
powerful effect libido desire reproduce. next episode, going
talk works relationship birth control, relationship
menopause. also going talk whole thing works males well.
cannabis aspects marijuana plant can impact levels testosterone
estrogen increasing aromatase. people aware that. well,
good data. able find several studies PubMed, pointing fact
smoking marijuana pregnancy can shift pattern hormones
developing fetus, promotes estrogenic outcomes. Now earlier said
estrogen masculinized male brain, utero true, way
cannabis seems work, least studies able identify
promotes circulating estrogen body therefore can counteract
masculinizing effects things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone, primary
secondary sexual characteristics. mention because, know think nowadays
marijuana use far widespread certainly puberty can profound
effects hormonal systems. another episode, goes really
deep this. yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity increasing aromatase.
Almost everyone can appreciate drinking pregnancy, not good
developing fetus. Fetal alcohol syndrome well-established negative outcome
pregnancy. something cognitive effects really bad.
actually physical malformation, et cetera. drinking pregnancy, not good.
Probably drinking puberty, not good either. alcohol, particular certain
things like beer grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity. Now, isn't
just protecting young boys estrogenic activity. also protecting girls


excessive even hypo estrogenic effects alcohol puberty. Now, many teenagers
drink. College students drink important point puberty doesn't start
one day end another day, puberty beginning middle end,
development really entire lifespan. idea know, puberty know
open close. just false.

00:56:25 Cell Phone Technology: Effects Hormones, Ovaries, & Testicles

Okay, talked cannabis. talked alcohol. talk cell
phones. First all, use cell phone. use often. not think evil
devices. think require discipline order make sure not
become negative force one's life. personally restrict number hours
phone particular social media. answer email particular
times day. cell phone itself? know, junior
professor. pre-tenure early professor. taught class neural circuits
health disease. one students asked me, know cell phones safe
brain? know, data point fact were. least
no data showing wasn't. still don't answer that, frankly.
don't see lot studies it. not personally aware evidence quality
peer reviewed studies showing cell phones bad brain holding
phone ear bad Bluetooth bad that. just not aware
quality studies. aware quality studies, peer reviewed study please reference
them, put comment section. Send me, however like. love
see them. not aware them. However, interested particular study
published back 2013 rats. basically took cell phone put
cage rats looked basically testicular ovarian development rats
saw minor still statistically significant defects ovarian testicular
development. Since now returning literature, seen absolute
explosion studies. quality journals,
call not blue ribbon journals. Identifying defects testicular ovarian
development mere exposure cell phone emitted waves. just call that, don't
know are. sounds almost crazy, right? Anytime somebody starts
talking EMS things like that, kind worry like, person okay?
look, literature pointing direction chronic exposure gonads


cell phones creating serious issues terms health cellular level
terms output. output testes sperm production.
Swimming speed sperm important feature sperm health. ovaries
estrogenic output. regular cycles are. animals, cycles
little bit different humans. don't menstrual cycle.
estrous cycle, generally around four days. think say based
literature, effects cell phone emitted waves gonadal development.
question is, proximity cell phone gonads? Now, taken
literature observe it. course point captions.
don't like cell phone pocket, well past puberty,
nonetheless effects seen adult animals. effects now
demonstrated humans. just talk couple
effects. paper published journal, "Clinical Biochemistry" S. Gander et al.
Looked hormone profiles people based proximity phone frequency
phone use, stored phone body. Aa well proximity
lived to, guess called radio-frequency towers. base stations.
looking effects radio frequency radiation RFR human hormone
profiles. show significant decreases cortisol. might say, "Well, might
good." need morning cortisol bump order wake up. Morning cortisol
good. also thyroid hormones significantly reduced. Prolactin young
females, definitely concerning testosterone levels males females.
so, now quite good data showing close phone much
day close interesting question living near one base stations
apparently can effects hormone profiles. see study like one
always ask, "Well, things also effects
hormone profiles?" Right? Cause imagine ran study
people live close waterway, close highway lot exhaust
buses cars, might see similar effects. take sorts
studies grain salt. think interesting. given last time
looked data way back junior professor like
one two studies find. One studies pointed increases
testosterone rats, close proximity radio-frequency
radiation waves. case, showed decreases testosterone.
really wasn't conclusion takeaway that. Now, pretty impressive


amount data pointing fact effects things hormones.
don't know information. not going stop using phone but,
light work Tyrone Hayes others looking sperm counts looking
decrease testosterone levels sperm counts fertility last 20, 30
years, perhaps know, not surprising. Although again, cell phones
smartphones really prominent use mostly within last 10 11 years.

01:02:33 Beards & Baldness Patterns Around World, DHT, 5-alpha-reductase

hard explain declines simply basis cell phone use.
interesting effects hormones actually can observe
outside people, tell something not just level hormones, also
underlying genetics. relate beard growth baldness.
fascinating. molecule, hormone dihydrotestosterone, made testosterone,
hormone primarily responsible facial hair, beard growth. well,
molecule, hormone primarily responsible lack hair head, hair loss.
work? Well, DHT circulates body binds DHT receptors
face promote hair growth. binds DHD receptors scalp promote
hair loss. Not incidentally, drugs designed prevent hair loss 5-alpha-
reductase inhibitors. remember 5-alpha-reductase Guevedoces? Well,
people discovered Güevedoces, went lot research
underlying biochemistry really interesting molecule dihydrotestosterone.
identified 5-alpha-reductase. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors basis
anti-hair loss treatments there. interesting things
here. First all, side effect profiles treatments hair loss quite severe
many individuals. Remember DHT primary androgen libido, strengthened
connective tissue repair, aggression. Even aggression course held
check, just sort ambition aggression related dopamine, within
testosterone pathway, less pure testosterone, although pure testosterone
effects. DHT is, least primate species including humans, dominant
androgen sorts effects. look somebody, everyone can
predict whether not going go bald based looking their, always
taught mother's father. mother's father bald, higher
probability going go bald. pattern DHT receptors scalp, will


dictate whether not going go bald everywhere just front
called crown type baldness. density beard tells density
DHT receptors. Now varies background, genetic background. actually
around world nowadays, people travel people form couples
kids many different people different mixed cultures. seeing starting
disappear. areas areas world men seem
pattern baldness, like strip baldness center, hair still
sides full beards. patterns DHT receptors
genetically determined. Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still high, DHT levels
blood can high yet people will light beards no beards.
don't lot DHT receptors face. still
cultures see people huge beard, tons beard. beards growing
way eyes huge heads hair.
lot DHT receptors face not scalp. lot
effects DHT can just see male phenotypes. interesting
hair loss drugs are, prevent hair loss drugs, directly aimed preventing
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone.
extent prevent hair loss, also extent have, bunch side effects
associated low DHT.

01:06:39 Creatine & DHT/Hair Loss

Along lines particular sports supplement lot people use called
Creatine. Creatine, now lot research showing Creatine can bring
water muscle. can support strength. number things.
Might even important cognitive promoting. Cognitive enhancement effects,
although mild. studies show can significant. people, not
anecdotal, report creatine promotes hair loss. differs individual.
people true, others no. yes appear, based studies able
find PubMed, creatine promote 5-alpha-reductase activity therefore
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone. makes sense
might promote degree hair loss, well beard growth, well
effects DHT. recall junior high school middle school, going home one Summer
seventh grade, coming back eighth grade kid knew


friends with, went like young kid to, like grown man, full
beard. amazing. like completely transformed. puberty
said before, without doubt accelerated rate development will
go point lives. Even faster infancy just terms huge
number different cognitive changes physical changes. Not surprisingly
individual mostly bald early twenties. must
just exceedingly high levels DHT. also played soccer kid
basically like dribbling past everybody. like grown man, playing soccer
bunch little kids.

01:08:20 Predicting Aging Rates Pubertal Rates

Full beard know, bald 20. rate maturation, rate aging
interesting. hard know rate aging. genetic tests now can allow
that. Things like Horvath Clocks things sort. Beautiful work David
Sinclair Harvard others pointed this. speed entry exit
puberty might be, putting hypothesis. Might interesting
window, fast one going aging developmental arc.
development course, doesn't just start birth end puberty. continues
entire life. think interesting. will often see people, boys girls.
say boys girls, will develop secondary sexual characteristics different rates.
sometimes sequential. know might see kid will, grow tall
big growth spurt, breast development will come little bit later.
features will come little bit later. can also see boys.
person referred earlier, friend developed full beard, know, went
bald. also quite muscular, great athlete. went puberty
exceedingly fast. people go slowly. people will go
puberty age 14, won't start accumulate facial hair much, much later.
voice will change first, early. won't get secondary
sexual characteristics much later. so, don't really know impacts
relates overall trajectory rate aging. interesting thing think
every one us. going offer opportunity experiment

interesting. think just testosterone one thing estrogen


another,

00:49:42 Cannabis, Alcohol: Babies, Puberty & Adults

turns nature far interesting that. Okay,
things impact sexual development early life later life. talk
cannabis. talk alcohol dare say talk cell phones. Something
never thought ever do, either podcast classroom. But,
days really interesting data. think aware them. First
all, cannabis, marijuana, THC. realize now lot different variance
this. lot different strains cannabis. personally not pot smoker.
just not me. not talking moral legal implications, States
decriminalized, places really illegal places basically legal.
check, know live understand laws. not
about. know however, exception one study
many studies point fact THC things cannabis promote
significant increases aromatase activity. Now pot smokers aren't going like this,
especially male pot smokers aren't going like reality. Remember,
hearing background Costello snoring really loud? put
screen? not cannabis smoker, can imagine why. Come Costello.
Come buddy, come here. asleep. Come here. [indistinct],
go. dog definitely not need cannabis. state time.
highly... Oh asleep still. asked see Costello just
listening audio, maybe gives [Costello grunts] Oh, okay. going let
get back sleep. always here, asked see him. Costello's not
pot smoker either. dog sitter pot smoker years ago.
favorite dog sitter but, not pot smoker. Again, no judgment. deal.
cannabis, not clear THC elements marijuana plant,
promote aromatase activity. Now, observed anecdotally pot
smokers higher incidence developing something mentioned
gynecomastia, breast bud development. full-blown breast development males.
may women want increase estrogenic activity. Remember
females make testosterone. comes adrenals, right? don't testes.
comes adrenals testosterone can also aromatized. Although


typically aromatase activity referring examples
males. testosterone can increase estrogenic activity. might say, "Oh
know, therefore testosterone reduce sexual behavior? create sorts
things related low testosterone?" Not necessarily, not necessarily.
why, estrogen males females important things like libido sexual
behavior. going repeat that. estrogen low males, can actually inhibit
libido sexual behavior. don't want estrogen high low. Whether
not male female. Now course females, estrogen levels tend higher
males. speaking generally here. just think back chromosomal
sex. referring say male female, although nuance
course. females, testosterone comes adrenals
powerful effect libido desire reproduce. next episode, going
talk works relationship birth control, relationship
menopause. also going talk whole thing works males well.
cannabis aspects marijuana plant can impact levels testosterone
estrogen increasing aromatase. people aware that. well,
good data. able find several studies PubMed, pointing fact
smoking marijuana pregnancy can shift pattern hormones
developing fetus, promotes estrogenic outcomes. Now earlier said
estrogen masculinized male brain, utero true, way
cannabis seems work, least studies able identify
promotes circulating estrogen body therefore can counteract
masculinizing effects things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone, primary
secondary sexual characteristics. mention because, know think nowadays
marijuana use far widespread certainly puberty can profound
effects hormonal systems. another episode, goes really
deep this. yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity increasing aromatase.
Almost everyone can appreciate drinking pregnancy, not good
developing fetus. Fetal alcohol syndrome well-established negative outcome
pregnancy. something cognitive effects really bad.
actually physical malformation, et cetera. drinking pregnancy, not good.
Probably drinking puberty, not good either. alcohol, particular certain
things like beer grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity. Now, isn't
just protecting young boys estrogenic activity. also protecting girls


excessive even hypo estrogenic effects alcohol puberty. Now, many teenagers
drink. College students drink important point puberty doesn't start
one day end another day, puberty beginning middle end,
development really entire lifespan. idea know, puberty know
open close. just false.

00:56:25 Cell Phone Technology: Effects Hormones, Ovaries, & Testicles

Okay, talked cannabis. talked alcohol. talk cell
phones. First all, use cell phone. use often. not think evil
devices. think require discipline order make sure not
become negative force one's life. personally restrict number hours
phone particular social media. answer email particular
times day. cell phone itself? know, junior
professor. pre-tenure early professor. taught class neural circuits
health disease. one students asked me, know cell phones safe
brain? know, data point fact were. least
no data showing wasn't. still don't answer that, frankly.
don't see lot studies it. not personally aware evidence quality
peer reviewed studies showing cell phones bad brain holding
phone ear bad Bluetooth bad that. just not aware
quality studies. aware quality studies, peer reviewed study please reference
them, put comment section. Send me, however like. love
see them. not aware them. However, interested particular study
published back 2013 rats. basically took cell phone put
cage rats looked basically testicular ovarian development rats
saw minor still statistically significant defects ovarian testicular
development. Since now returning literature, seen absolute
explosion studies. quality journals,
call not blue ribbon journals. Identifying defects testicular ovarian
development mere exposure cell phone emitted waves. just call that, don't
know are. sounds almost crazy, right? Anytime somebody starts
talking EMS things like that, kind worry like, person okay?
look, literature pointing direction chronic exposure gonads


cell phones creating serious issues terms health cellular level
terms output. output testes sperm production.
Swimming speed sperm important feature sperm health. ovaries
estrogenic output. regular cycles are. animals, cycles
little bit different humans. don't menstrual cycle.
estrous cycle, generally around four days. think say based
literature, effects cell phone emitted waves gonadal development.
question is, proximity cell phone gonads? Now, taken
literature observe it. course point captions.
don't like cell phone pocket, well past puberty,
nonetheless effects seen adult animals. effects now
demonstrated humans. just talk couple
effects. paper published journal, "Clinical Biochemistry" S. Gander et al.
Looked hormone profiles people based proximity phone frequency
phone use, stored phone body. Aa well proximity
lived to, guess called radio-frequency towers. base stations.
looking effects radio frequency radiation RFR human hormone
profiles. show significant decreases cortisol. might say, "Well, might
good." need morning cortisol bump order wake up. Morning cortisol
good. also thyroid hormones significantly reduced. Prolactin young
females, definitely concerning testosterone levels males females.
so, now quite good data showing close phone much
day close interesting question living near one base stations
apparently can effects hormone profiles. see study like one
always ask, "Well, things also effects
hormone profiles?" Right? Cause imagine ran study
people live close waterway, close highway lot exhaust
buses cars, might see similar effects. take sorts
studies grain salt. think interesting. given last time
looked data way back junior professor like
one two studies find. One studies pointed increases
testosterone rats, close proximity radio-frequency
radiation waves. case, showed decreases testosterone.
really wasn't conclusion takeaway that. Now, pretty impressive


amount data pointing fact effects things hormones.
don't know information. not going stop using phone but,
light work Tyrone Hayes others looking sperm counts looking
decrease testosterone levels sperm counts fertility last 20, 30
years, perhaps know, not surprising. Although again, cell phones
smartphones really prominent use mostly within last 10 11 years.

01:02:33 Beards & Baldness Patterns Around World, DHT, 5-alpha-reductase

hard explain declines simply basis cell phone use.
interesting effects hormones actually can observe
outside people, tell something not just level hormones, also
underlying genetics. relate beard growth baldness.
fascinating. molecule, hormone dihydrotestosterone, made testosterone,
hormone primarily responsible facial hair, beard growth. well,
molecule, hormone primarily responsible lack hair head, hair loss.
work? Well, DHT circulates body binds DHT receptors
face promote hair growth. binds DHD receptors scalp promote
hair loss. Not incidentally, drugs designed prevent hair loss 5-alpha-
reductase inhibitors. remember 5-alpha-reductase Guevedoces? Well,
people discovered Güevedoces, went lot research
underlying biochemistry really interesting molecule dihydrotestosterone.
identified 5-alpha-reductase. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors basis
anti-hair loss treatments there. interesting things
here. First all, side effect profiles treatments hair loss quite severe
many individuals. Remember DHT primary androgen libido, strengthened
connective tissue repair, aggression. Even aggression course held
check, just sort ambition aggression related dopamine, within
testosterone pathway, less pure testosterone, although pure testosterone
effects. DHT is, least primate species including humans, dominant
androgen sorts effects. look somebody, everyone can
predict whether not going go bald based looking their, always
taught mother's father. mother's father bald, higher
probability going go bald. pattern DHT receptors scalp, will


dictate whether not going go bald everywhere just front
called crown type baldness. density beard tells density
DHT receptors. Now varies background, genetic background. actually
around world nowadays, people travel people form couples
kids many different people different mixed cultures. seeing starting
disappear. areas areas world men seem
pattern baldness, like strip baldness center, hair still
sides full beards. patterns DHT receptors
genetically determined. Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still high, DHT levels
blood can high yet people will light beards no beards.
don't lot DHT receptors face. still
cultures see people huge beard, tons beard. beards growing
way eyes huge heads hair.
lot DHT receptors face not scalp. lot
effects DHT can just see male phenotypes. interesting
hair loss drugs are, prevent hair loss drugs, directly aimed preventing
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone.
extent prevent hair loss, also extent have, bunch side effects
associated low DHT.

01:06:39 Creatine & DHT/Hair Loss

Along lines particular sports supplement lot people use called
Creatine. Creatine, now lot research showing Creatine can bring
water muscle. can support strength. number things.
Might even important cognitive promoting. Cognitive enhancement effects,
although mild. studies show can significant. people, not
anecdotal, report creatine promotes hair loss. differs individual.
people true, others no. yes appear, based studies able
find PubMed, creatine promote 5-alpha-reductase activity therefore
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone. makes sense
might promote degree hair loss, well beard growth, well
effects DHT. recall junior high school middle school, going home one Summer
seventh grade, coming back eighth grade kid knew


friends with, went like young kid to, like grown man, full
beard. amazing. like completely transformed. puberty
said before, without doubt accelerated rate development will
go point lives. Even faster infancy just terms huge
number different cognitive changes physical changes. Not surprisingly
individual mostly bald early twenties. must
just exceedingly high levels DHT. also played soccer kid
basically like dribbling past everybody. like grown man, playing soccer
bunch little kids.

01:08:20 Predicting Aging Rates Pubertal Rates

Full beard know, bald 20. rate maturation, rate aging
interesting. hard know rate aging. genetic tests now can allow
that. Things like Horvath Clocks things sort. Beautiful work David
Sinclair Harvard others pointed this. speed entry exit
puberty might be, putting hypothesis. Might interesting
window, fast one going aging developmental arc.
development course, doesn't just start birth end puberty. continues
entire life. think interesting. will often see people, boys girls.
say boys girls, will develop secondary sexual characteristics different rates.
sometimes sequential. know might see kid will, grow tall
big growth spurt, breast development will come little bit later.
features will come little bit later. can also see boys.
person referred earlier, friend developed full beard, know, went
bald. also quite muscular, great athlete. went puberty
exceedingly fast. people go slowly. people will go
puberty age 14, won't start accumulate facial hair much, much later.
voice will change first, early. won't get secondary
sexual characteristics much later. so, don't really know impacts
relates overall trajectory rate aging. interesting thing think
every one us. going offer opportunity experiment
today,



01:10:04 Hyenas, Baseball, & Hypertrophied Clitorises: Androstenedione

00:49:42 Cannabis, Alcohol: Babies, Puberty & Adults

turns nature far interesting that. Okay,
things impact sexual development early life later life. talk
cannabis. talk alcohol dare say talk cell phones. Something
never thought ever do, either podcast classroom. But,
days really interesting data. think aware them. First
all, cannabis, marijuana, THC. realize now lot different variance
this. lot different strains cannabis. personally not pot smoker.
just not me. not talking moral legal implications, States
decriminalized, places really illegal places basically legal.
check, know live understand laws. not
about. know however, exception one study
many studies point fact THC things cannabis promote
significant increases aromatase activity. Now pot smokers aren't going like this,
especially male pot smokers aren't going like reality. Remember,
hearing background Costello snoring really loud? put
screen? not cannabis smoker, can imagine why. Come Costello.
Come buddy, come here. asleep. Come here. [indistinct],
go. dog definitely not need cannabis. state time.
highly... Oh asleep still. asked see Costello just
listening audio, maybe gives [Costello grunts] Oh, okay. going let
get back sleep. always here, asked see him. Costello's not
pot smoker either. dog sitter pot smoker years ago.
favorite dog sitter but, not pot smoker. Again, no judgment. deal.
cannabis, not clear THC elements marijuana plant,
promote aromatase activity. Now, observed anecdotally pot
smokers higher incidence developing something mentioned
gynecomastia, breast bud development. full-blown breast development males.
may women want increase estrogenic activity. Remember
females make testosterone. comes adrenals, right? don't testes.
comes adrenals testosterone can also aromatized. Although


typically aromatase activity referring examples
males. testosterone can increase estrogenic activity. might say, "Oh
know, therefore testosterone reduce sexual behavior? create sorts
things related low testosterone?" Not necessarily, not necessarily.
why, estrogen males females important things like libido sexual
behavior. going repeat that. estrogen low males, can actually inhibit
libido sexual behavior. don't want estrogen high low. Whether
not male female. Now course females, estrogen levels tend higher
males. speaking generally here. just think back chromosomal
sex. referring say male female, although nuance
course. females, testosterone comes adrenals
powerful effect libido desire reproduce. next episode, going
talk works relationship birth control, relationship
menopause. also going talk whole thing works males well.
cannabis aspects marijuana plant can impact levels testosterone
estrogen increasing aromatase. people aware that. well,
good data. able find several studies PubMed, pointing fact
smoking marijuana pregnancy can shift pattern hormones
developing fetus, promotes estrogenic outcomes. Now earlier said
estrogen masculinized male brain, utero true, way
cannabis seems work, least studies able identify
promotes circulating estrogen body therefore can counteract
masculinizing effects things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone, primary
secondary sexual characteristics. mention because, know think nowadays
marijuana use far widespread certainly puberty can profound
effects hormonal systems. another episode, goes really
deep this. yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity increasing aromatase.
Almost everyone can appreciate drinking pregnancy, not good
developing fetus. Fetal alcohol syndrome well-established negative outcome
pregnancy. something cognitive effects really bad.
actually physical malformation, et cetera. drinking pregnancy, not good.
Probably drinking puberty, not good either. alcohol, particular certain
things like beer grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity. Now, isn't
just protecting young boys estrogenic activity. also protecting girls


excessive even hypo estrogenic effects alcohol puberty. Now, many teenagers
drink. College students drink important point puberty doesn't start
one day end another day, puberty beginning middle end,
development really entire lifespan. idea know, puberty know
open close. just false.

00:56:25 Cell Phone Technology: Effects Hormones, Ovaries, & Testicles

Okay, talked cannabis. talked alcohol. talk cell
phones. First all, use cell phone. use often. not think evil
devices. think require discipline order make sure not
become negative force one's life. personally restrict number hours
phone particular social media. answer email particular
times day. cell phone itself? know, junior
professor. pre-tenure early professor. taught class neural circuits
health disease. one students asked me, know cell phones safe
brain? know, data point fact were. least
no data showing wasn't. still don't answer that, frankly.
don't see lot studies it. not personally aware evidence quality
peer reviewed studies showing cell phones bad brain holding
phone ear bad Bluetooth bad that. just not aware
quality studies. aware quality studies, peer reviewed study please reference
them, put comment section. Send me, however like. love
see them. not aware them. However, interested particular study
published back 2013 rats. basically took cell phone put
cage rats looked basically testicular ovarian development rats
saw minor still statistically significant defects ovarian testicular
development. Since now returning literature, seen absolute
explosion studies. quality journals,
call not blue ribbon journals. Identifying defects testicular ovarian
development mere exposure cell phone emitted waves. just call that, don't
know are. sounds almost crazy, right? Anytime somebody starts
talking EMS things like that, kind worry like, person okay?
look, literature pointing direction chronic exposure gonads


cell phones creating serious issues terms health cellular level
terms output. output testes sperm production.
Swimming speed sperm important feature sperm health. ovaries
estrogenic output. regular cycles are. animals, cycles
little bit different humans. don't menstrual cycle.
estrous cycle, generally around four days. think say based
literature, effects cell phone emitted waves gonadal development.
question is, proximity cell phone gonads? Now, taken
literature observe it. course point captions.
don't like cell phone pocket, well past puberty,
nonetheless effects seen adult animals. effects now
demonstrated humans. just talk couple
effects. paper published journal, "Clinical Biochemistry" S. Gander et al.
Looked hormone profiles people based proximity phone frequency
phone use, stored phone body. Aa well proximity
lived to, guess called radio-frequency towers. base stations.
looking effects radio frequency radiation RFR human hormone
profiles. show significant decreases cortisol. might say, "Well, might
good." need morning cortisol bump order wake up. Morning cortisol
good. also thyroid hormones significantly reduced. Prolactin young
females, definitely concerning testosterone levels males females.
so, now quite good data showing close phone much
day close interesting question living near one base stations
apparently can effects hormone profiles. see study like one
always ask, "Well, things also effects
hormone profiles?" Right? Cause imagine ran study
people live close waterway, close highway lot exhaust
buses cars, might see similar effects. take sorts
studies grain salt. think interesting. given last time
looked data way back junior professor like
one two studies find. One studies pointed increases
testosterone rats, close proximity radio-frequency
radiation waves. case, showed decreases testosterone.
really wasn't conclusion takeaway that. Now, pretty impressive


amount data pointing fact effects things hormones.
don't know information. not going stop using phone but,
light work Tyrone Hayes others looking sperm counts looking
decrease testosterone levels sperm counts fertility last 20, 30
years, perhaps know, not surprising. Although again, cell phones
smartphones really prominent use mostly within last 10 11 years.

01:02:33 Beards & Baldness Patterns Around World, DHT, 5-alpha-reductase

hard explain declines simply basis cell phone use.
interesting effects hormones actually can observe
outside people, tell something not just level hormones, also
underlying genetics. relate beard growth baldness.
fascinating. molecule, hormone dihydrotestosterone, made testosterone,
hormone primarily responsible facial hair, beard growth. well,
molecule, hormone primarily responsible lack hair head, hair loss.
work? Well, DHT circulates body binds DHT receptors
face promote hair growth. binds DHD receptors scalp promote
hair loss. Not incidentally, drugs designed prevent hair loss 5-alpha-
reductase inhibitors. remember 5-alpha-reductase Guevedoces? Well,
people discovered Güevedoces, went lot research
underlying biochemistry really interesting molecule dihydrotestosterone.
identified 5-alpha-reductase. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors basis
anti-hair loss treatments there. interesting things
here. First all, side effect profiles treatments hair loss quite severe
many individuals. Remember DHT primary androgen libido, strengthened
connective tissue repair, aggression. Even aggression course held
check, just sort ambition aggression related dopamine, within
testosterone pathway, less pure testosterone, although pure testosterone
effects. DHT is, least primate species including humans, dominant
androgen sorts effects. look somebody, everyone can
predict whether not going go bald based looking their, always
taught mother's father. mother's father bald, higher
probability going go bald. pattern DHT receptors scalp, will


dictate whether not going go bald everywhere just front
called crown type baldness. density beard tells density
DHT receptors. Now varies background, genetic background. actually
around world nowadays, people travel people form couples
kids many different people different mixed cultures. seeing starting
disappear. areas areas world men seem
pattern baldness, like strip baldness center, hair still
sides full beards. patterns DHT receptors
genetically determined. Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still high, DHT levels
blood can high yet people will light beards no beards.
don't lot DHT receptors face. still
cultures see people huge beard, tons beard. beards growing
way eyes huge heads hair.
lot DHT receptors face not scalp. lot
effects DHT can just see male phenotypes. interesting
hair loss drugs are, prevent hair loss drugs, directly aimed preventing
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone.
extent prevent hair loss, also extent have, bunch side effects
associated low DHT.

01:06:39 Creatine & DHT/Hair Loss

Along lines particular sports supplement lot people use called
Creatine. Creatine, now lot research showing Creatine can bring
water muscle. can support strength. number things.
Might even important cognitive promoting. Cognitive enhancement effects,
although mild. studies show can significant. people, not
anecdotal, report creatine promotes hair loss. differs individual.
people true, others no. yes appear, based studies able
find PubMed, creatine promote 5-alpha-reductase activity therefore
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone. makes sense
might promote degree hair loss, well beard growth, well
effects DHT. recall junior high school middle school, going home one Summer
seventh grade, coming back eighth grade kid knew


friends with, went like young kid to, like grown man, full
beard. amazing. like completely transformed. puberty
said before, without doubt accelerated rate development will
go point lives. Even faster infancy just terms huge
number different cognitive changes physical changes. Not surprisingly
individual mostly bald early twenties. must
just exceedingly high levels DHT. also played soccer kid
basically like dribbling past everybody. like grown man, playing soccer
bunch little kids.

01:08:20 Predicting Aging Rates Pubertal Rates

Full beard know, bald 20. rate maturation, rate aging
interesting. hard know rate aging. genetic tests now can allow
that. Things like Horvath Clocks things sort. Beautiful work David
Sinclair Harvard others pointed this. speed entry exit
puberty might be, putting hypothesis. Might interesting
window, fast one going aging developmental arc.
development course, doesn't just start birth end puberty. continues
entire life. think interesting. will often see people, boys girls.
say boys girls, will develop secondary sexual characteristics different rates.
sometimes sequential. know might see kid will, grow tall
big growth spurt, breast development will come little bit later.
features will come little bit later. can also see boys.
person referred earlier, friend developed full beard, know, went
bald. also quite muscular, great athlete. went puberty
exceedingly fast. people go slowly. people will go
puberty age 14, won't start accumulate facial hair much, much later.
voice will change first, early. won't get secondary
sexual characteristics much later. so, don't really know impacts
relates overall trajectory rate aging. interesting thing think
every one us. going offer opportunity experiment

consistent auto acoustic emission study Dennis McFadden published.
points fact early exposure androgens may impact, not just
androgenization body plan, also separately sexual preference. Now,
raises sorts interesting questions biological basis sexual preference.

01:29:13 Brain Dimorphisms Sexual Orientation

tell another study. guy named Simon LeVay UCLA.

Nature, replicated no fewer six times. McFadden results
point strong biological correlates mate choice, sexual preference. tie
directly things like androgenization estrogenization. Meaning call
maleness femaleness, sort tricky territory. way
described huge range sex can defined earlier. So, want
measure D2 D4 ratio welcome to, also understand
not predictive anything, right? just window possible androgen exposure

course, things can impact opposite sex same-sex partner choice
later life. study not look people reported bisexual.

01:32:00 “Older Brother Effects”: Male Fetuses Might Change Mothers & Subsequent
Brothers

hasn't lot studies yet. One thing interesting,
good scientific data also controversy that, appears
probability male human self-reporting homosexual, increases
number older brothers has. Now, doesn't mean older
brother even 10 older brothers, sure self-report
homosexual. statistically becomes likely somebody will
successive older brother have. idea starting emerge,

many male fetuses carried, male fetuses secreting certain
things, dihydrotestosterone, things, can feed back genome.
epigenomic effects onto placenta itself, higher
probability subsequent pregnancies offspring will self-report homosexual.
fascinating area biology. noticed today, none deals
current controversies around gender many genders sex, et cetera
separate conversation definition grounded kind concepts
talking today needs take place, taking consideration aspects
sex effects hormones, body, brain. didn't talk lot
spinal cord, will next episode. can just say brain
periphery, early effects, late effects, acute effects, meaning effects fast
levels hormones going down. Something absolutely happens
across menstrual cycle. well long-term effects like effects
hormones gene expression. today, always, weren't able cover things


related sex hormones sexual differentiation development. no way

01:35:06 Path Forward & Warning

Next episode, going talking science sex, verb, actual
reproduction. also going talking effects hormones various
aspects behavior ways modulate hormones, use behavior,
supplementation. Also touch diet nutrition bit. going talk
interactions things behavior, relate important
themes like sex reproduction. Like workplace performance. Like motivation

00:31:25 Estrogen, NOT Testosterone, Masculinizes Brain

deepening voice, et cetera. Now information gets even
interesting applies essentially everybody. might think testosterone
masculinizes body secondary sexual characteristic way.
dihydrotestosterone another androgen, masculinizes primary sexual
characteristics. growth penis early on, testosterone must masculinize
brain. fact aspects masculinization brain body,
independent genitalia. Now might obvious you, people
probably don't realize that. Yes indeed brain receptors testosterone. also
receptors estrogen. fascinating thing look brains
people Y chromosomes testes make testosterone,
look brains people don't Y chromosomes testes therefore


make far less testosterone general, realize cells brain

dihydrotestosterone. just want mention tools. might asking yourself,
"How tools possibly come stage conversation talking
sexual development talking differentiation tissues
body." Well, true children parents adults. want emphasize
things environmental things people use
homes sometimes actually can impact hormone levels can impact sexual
development fairly profound ways. want clear, not pulling
rare journal never heard it. pulling textbooks.
particular, today guiding lot conversation work "Behavioral
Endocrinology," book Randy Nelson Lance Kriegsfeld. True experts
field. going talk work Tyrone Hayes UC Berkeley
environmental toxins impacts things like testosterone
estrogen. going touch them. going give anecdotal evidence
grounded studies, will provide caption reference here.
One actually really interesting helps illustrate principle
talking is. years ago, lot excitement Evening
Primrose Oil. Evening Primrose Oil lot products typically associated
skin beauty skin health. generalizing here. typically
mothers sisters using it. actually examples starting crop
young boys getting accelerated breast bud development skin contact
women using Evening Primrose Oil. Evening Primrose Oil chemically lot
like estrogen lot estrogenic compounds. number things
like this. believe not things like pine pollen look much like testosterone
structurally. less testosterone. bioavailability humans isn't
clear. Evening Primrose Oil lot estrogenic elements it. Just structurally
built. cases boys understandably know,
hugged mom maybe even like showering taking. know using
Evening Primrose Oil solution. things will actually change levels estrogens


boys girls. wasn't just issue young boys. also issue
young girls. not Evening Primrose Oil bad, just many
probably heard dangers Soy Isoflavones things like that.
impact soy estrogen levels is, decent evidence support that.
However, lot factors severe. one
Evening Primrose Oil. regardless age, just put way people
might wanting drive hormones estrogenic androgenic.
know preference is? don't know. case, things like
pre Evening Primrose Oil can actually promote estrogenic pathways body
can go transdermal. Likewise, testosterone replacement therapy
fairly widespread nowadays. people accomplish cream. pretty
well understood that, someone's taking want avoid contact anyone.
Skin contact anyone trying promote estrogenic activity body.

00:39:00 Environmental Endocrine Disruptors, Sperm Count Decline, Vincloziline

especially children. one. issue environmental factors.
Now this, know, just going highlight, one starts talking
environmental factors poisoning us disrupting growth fertility rates
can start sound little bit crazy. Except start actually look
real data, Data quality research labs funded Federal government funded, not
companies sources, really aimed understanding
underlying biology is. really, grateful Tyrone Hayes
UC Berkeley. remember way back graduate student late nineties,
goodness. UC Berkeley. remember him, studying frogs. talking
developmental defects frogs live different waters around
California, also elsewhere. identified substance, present lot
waterways throughout country countries. US beyond. Certainly not
just restricted California, atrazine. A-T-R-A-Z-I-N-E. Again,
stuff textbooks. causes severe testicular malformations. again, atrazine
exposure serious. interesting look data, find
sites Western Midwestern sections United States 10 92% male
frogs. frogs mind you, testicular abnormalities. severe
testicular malformations testes rather sperm. actually


organ itself, gonad itself. Now well known now atrazine many
herbicides. know, whereas say 80's 90's discussion
around herbicides negative effects considered kind like hippy-dippy stuff
stuff hear know, local community markets kind
new age communities. Now solid data, Federally funded labs major
universities peer reviewed published excellent journals, showing
indeed many herbicides can negative effects, primarily impacting
ratios hormones either mothers testes, altering testes
fathers direct effects developing young animals potentially humans.
ask, "Well, humans? Frogs wonderful, humans?"
data happening isn't going scary stuff.
also going talk tools ameliorate offset effects. One
be, cautious Evening Primrose well testosterone creams, depending
whether not want androgenic estrogenic depending needs.
across human populations, sperm counts indeed declining, okay? 1940,
average, average density human sperm 113 million per milliliter semen.
measured. many sperm per milliliter semen. 1990 figure
dropped 66. went 113 million per milliliter 66 million per milliliter
United States Western Europe. not just US thing. Researchers also
estimated volume semen produced men dropped 20% time,
reduced sperm count per generation even further. 1981 1991, ratio
normal spermatogenesis decreased 56.4% 26.9%. lot
happening primarily herbicides widespread use reduce
sperm counts. going profound effects not just sperm counts,
development, sexual development level gonads brain.
need testosterone get dihydrotestosterone primary sexual
characteristics. need estrogen come testosterone masculinize
brain. course, not just focusing sperm testosterone. course
also know many herbicides disrupting estrogens similar way.
leading hyper estrogenic, excuse me, states might explain puberty
happening much earlier young girls days. lot things
happening. Now mean run around neurotically avoid
anything includes things like atrazine avoiding kinds
herbicides? don't know you. seem pretty marked


effects, animal studies human studies. know, can open
textbook like endocrinology textbook find things like Vinclozolin. V-I-N-C-L-O-
Z-O-L-I-N, fungicide anti-androgen. give animals, rats.
instead forming penis, don't form penis. basically, not
form clitoris,

Y chromosome, born make testosterone. testes
don't Mullerian Ducts Y chromosome Mullerian
inhibiting hormone. However, individuals look completely female. general,
report feeling like girls young, women older.
something unusual happening individuals XY
chromosomal type not XX. happening? Well happening
testes making testosterone, receptor testosterone mutated.
therefore testes never descend. don't ovaries, testes
testes internal. typically individuals find actually XY
chromosomes. know, chromosomal sex male. will.
gonadal sex male, gonads, testes inside body. don't actually
develop scrotum. don't make ovaries. don't menstruate around
time puberty sign something different. never
menstruate around puberty. look deeply enough, find
actually XY. make testosterone body can't make use
testosterone don't receptors. receptors vitally
important some, secondary sexual characteristics talked
about. Body hair, penis growth puberty et cetera. live fairly happy lives
females. Although course can't conceive, right? don't uterus,


don't ovaries. also general, don't produce sperm quantities enough
actually reproduce somebody else, although sometimes can.
believe not, not going name names actually reports
several people, fairly prominent people throughout history androgen
insensitivity syndrome people suspected did. reason not name names
that, gets right heart whether not male female.
say right? XY chromosomes gonadally testes inside.
yet, looked bodies looked faces, say almost
certainty appeared female. naturally occurring experiment, points
fact testosterone shows body impacts things
levels receptor profound effect phenotype. external body plan.
again, talking order illustrate principle order
effects, hormone doesn't just present. hormone actually
able bind receptor take action target cells. again, just throw
example people using performance enhancing drugs. Although
pretty broad statement, nowadays lot excitement so-called
SARMs. receptor side. talk future
episode. just say teaser SARMs happening right
now augmenting sports performance, testosterone directly also
testosterone derivatives also altering things level receptor
exceedingly interesting revealing us many ways

00:48:41 Estrogen Establishes “Masculine” Brain Circuits, Testosterone

hormones can impact brain body. ways didn't suspect. Perhaps
simplest way understand estrogen testosterone impact masculinization
feminization brain behavior statement. actually closing
sentence abstract colleague Neuronal Shaw Stanford school
medicine published. estrogen, estrogen aromatized
testosterone aromatase, sets masculine repertoire sexual, animals
humans, territorial behaviors. sets circuitry brain. Estrogen
that. Estrogen sets masculine circuitry brain testosterone
controls display behaviors later life. find incredibly
interesting. think just testosterone one thing estrogen


another,

00:49:42 Cannabis, Alcohol: Babies, Puberty & Adults

turns nature far interesting that. Okay,
things impact sexual development early life later life. talk
cannabis. talk alcohol dare say talk cell phones. Something
never thought ever do, either podcast classroom. But,
days really interesting data. think aware them. First
all, cannabis, marijuana, THC. realize now lot different variance
this. lot different strains cannabis. personally not pot smoker.
just not me. not talking moral legal implications, States
decriminalized, places really illegal places basically legal.
check, know live understand laws. not
about. know however, exception one study
many studies point fact THC things cannabis promote
significant increases aromatase activity. Now pot smokers aren't going like this,
especially male pot smokers aren't going like reality. Remember,
hearing background Costello snoring really loud? put
screen? not cannabis smoker, can imagine why. Come Costello.
Come buddy, come here. asleep. Come here. [indistinct],
go. dog definitely not need cannabis. state time.
highly... Oh asleep still. asked see Costello just
listening audio, maybe gives [Costello grunts] Oh, okay. going let
get back sleep. always here, asked see him. Costello's not
pot smoker either. dog sitter pot smoker years ago.
favorite dog sitter but, not pot smoker. Again, no judgment. deal.
cannabis, not clear THC elements marijuana plant,
promote aromatase activity. Now, observed anecdotally pot
smokers higher incidence developing something mentioned
gynecomastia, breast bud development. full-blown breast development males.
may women want increase estrogenic activity. Remember
females make testosterone. comes adrenals, right? don't testes.
comes adrenals testosterone can also aromatized. Although


typically aromatase activity referring examples
males. testosterone can increase estrogenic activity. might say, "Oh
know, therefore testosterone reduce sexual behavior? create sorts
things related low testosterone?" Not necessarily, not necessarily.
why, estrogen males females important things like libido sexual
behavior. going repeat that. estrogen low males, can actually inhibit
libido sexual behavior. don't want estrogen high low. Whether
not male female. Now course females, estrogen levels tend higher
males. speaking generally here. just think back chromosomal
sex. referring say male female, although nuance
course. females, testosterone comes adrenals
powerful effect libido desire reproduce. next episode, going
talk works relationship birth control, relationship
menopause. also going talk whole thing works males well.
cannabis aspects marijuana plant can impact levels testosterone
estrogen increasing aromatase. people aware that. well,
good data. able find several studies PubMed, pointing fact
smoking marijuana pregnancy can shift pattern hormones
developing fetus, promotes estrogenic outcomes. Now earlier said
estrogen masculinized male brain, utero true, way
cannabis seems work, least studies able identify
promotes circulating estrogen body therefore can counteract
masculinizing effects things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone, primary
secondary sexual characteristics. mention because, know think nowadays
marijuana use far widespread certainly puberty can profound
effects hormonal systems. another episode, goes really
deep this. yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity increasing aromatase.
Almost everyone can appreciate drinking pregnancy, not good
developing fetus. Fetal alcohol syndrome well-established negative outcome
pregnancy. something cognitive effects really bad.
actually physical malformation, et cetera. drinking pregnancy, not good.
Probably drinking puberty, not good either. alcohol, particular certain
things like beer grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity. Now, isn't
just protecting young boys estrogenic activity. also protecting girls


excessive even hypo estrogenic effects alcohol puberty. Now, many teenagers
drink. College students drink important point puberty doesn't start
one day end another day, puberty beginning middle end,
development really entire lifespan. idea know, puberty know
open close. just false.

00:56:25 Cell Phone Technology: Effects Hormones, Ovaries, & Testicles

Okay, talked cannabis. talked alcohol. talk cell
phones. First all, use cell phone. use often. not think evil
devices. think require discipline order make sure not
become negative force one's life. personally restrict number hours
phone particular social media. answer email particular
times day. cell phone itself? know, junior
professor. pre-tenure early professor. taught class neural circuits
health disease. one students asked me, know cell phones safe
brain? know, data point fact were. least
no data showing wasn't. still don't answer that, frankly.
don't see lot studies it. not personally aware evidence quality
peer reviewed studies showing cell phones bad brain holding
phone ear bad Bluetooth bad that. just not aware
quality studies. aware quality studies, peer reviewed study please reference
them, put comment section. Send me, however like. love
see them. not aware them. However, interested particular study
published back 2013 rats. basically took cell phone put
cage rats looked basically testicular ovarian development rats
saw minor still statistically significant defects ovarian testicular
development. Since now returning literature, seen absolute
explosion studies. quality journals,
call not blue ribbon journals. Identifying defects testicular ovarian
development mere exposure cell phone emitted waves. just call that, don't
know are. sounds almost crazy, right? Anytime somebody starts
talking EMS things like that, kind worry like, person okay?
look, literature pointing direction chronic exposure gonads


cell phones creating serious issues terms health cellular level
terms output. output testes sperm production.
Swimming speed sperm important feature sperm health. ovaries
estrogenic output. regular cycles are. animals, cycles
little bit different humans. don't menstrual cycle.
estrous cycle, generally around four days. think say based
literature, effects cell phone emitted waves gonadal development.
question is, proximity cell phone gonads? Now, taken
literature observe it. course point captions.
don't like cell phone pocket, well past puberty,
nonetheless effects seen adult animals. effects now
demonstrated humans. just talk couple
effects. paper published journal, "Clinical Biochemistry" S. Gander et al.
Looked hormone profiles people based proximity phone frequency
phone use, stored phone body. Aa well proximity
lived to, guess called radio-frequency towers. base stations.
looking effects radio frequency radiation RFR human hormone
profiles. show significant decreases cortisol. might say, "Well, might
good." need morning cortisol bump order wake up. Morning cortisol
good. also thyroid hormones significantly reduced. Prolactin young
females, definitely concerning testosterone levels males females.
so, now quite good data showing close phone much
day close interesting question living near one base stations
apparently can effects hormone profiles. see study like one
always ask, "Well, things also effects
hormone profiles?" Right? Cause imagine ran study
people live close waterway, close highway lot exhaust
buses cars, might see similar effects. take sorts
studies grain salt. think interesting. given last time
looked data way back junior professor like
one two studies find. One studies pointed increases
testosterone rats, close proximity radio-frequency
radiation waves. case, showed decreases testosterone.
really wasn't conclusion takeaway that. Now, pretty impressive


amount data pointing fact effects things hormones.
don't know information. not going stop using phone but,
light work Tyrone Hayes others looking sperm counts looking
decrease testosterone levels sperm counts fertility last 20, 30
years, perhaps know, not surprising. Although again, cell phones
smartphones really prominent use mostly within last 10 11 years.

01:02:33 Beards & Baldness Patterns Around World, DHT, 5-alpha-reductase

hard explain declines simply basis cell phone use.
interesting effects hormones actually can observe
outside people, tell something not just level hormones, also
underlying genetics. relate beard growth baldness.
fascinating. molecule, hormone dihydrotestosterone, made testosterone,
hormone primarily responsible facial hair, beard growth. well,
molecule, hormone primarily responsible lack hair head, hair loss.
work? Well, DHT circulates body binds DHT receptors
face promote hair growth. binds DHD receptors scalp promote
hair loss. Not incidentally, drugs designed prevent hair loss 5-alpha-
reductase inhibitors. remember 5-alpha-reductase Guevedoces? Well,
people discovered Güevedoces, went lot research
underlying biochemistry really interesting molecule dihydrotestosterone.
identified 5-alpha-reductase. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors basis
anti-hair loss treatments there. interesting things
here. First all, side effect profiles treatments hair loss quite severe
many individuals. Remember DHT primary androgen libido, strengthened
connective tissue repair, aggression. Even aggression course held
check, just sort ambition aggression related dopamine, within
testosterone pathway, less pure testosterone, although pure testosterone
effects. DHT is, least primate species including humans, dominant
androgen sorts effects. look somebody, everyone can
predict whether not going go bald based looking their, always
taught mother's father. mother's father bald, higher
probability going go bald. pattern DHT receptors scalp, will


dictate whether not going go bald everywhere just front
called crown type baldness. density beard tells density
DHT receptors. Now varies background, genetic background. actually
around world nowadays, people travel people form couples
kids many different people different mixed cultures. seeing starting
disappear. areas areas world men seem
pattern baldness, like strip baldness center, hair still
sides full beards. patterns DHT receptors
genetically determined. Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still high, DHT levels
blood can high yet people will light beards no beards.
don't lot DHT receptors face. still
cultures see people huge beard, tons beard. beards growing
way eyes huge heads hair.
lot DHT receptors face not scalp. lot
effects DHT can just see male phenotypes. interesting
hair loss drugs are, prevent hair loss drugs, directly aimed preventing
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone.
extent prevent hair loss, also extent have, bunch side effects
associated low DHT.

01:06:39 Creatine & DHT/Hair Loss

Along lines particular sports supplement lot people use called
Creatine. Creatine, now lot research showing Creatine can bring
water muscle. can support strength. number things.
Might even important cognitive promoting. Cognitive enhancement effects,
although mild. studies show can significant. people, not
anecdotal, report creatine promotes hair loss. differs individual.
people true, others no. yes appear, based studies able
find PubMed, creatine promote 5-alpha-reductase activity therefore
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone. makes sense
might promote degree hair loss, well beard growth, well
effects DHT. recall junior high school middle school, going home one Summer
seventh grade, coming back eighth grade kid knew


friends with, went like young kid to, like grown man, full
beard. amazing. like completely transformed. puberty
said before, without doubt accelerated rate development will
go point lives. Even faster infancy just terms huge
number different cognitive changes physical changes. Not surprisingly
individual mostly bald early twenties. must
just exceedingly high levels DHT. also played soccer kid
basically like dribbling past everybody. like grown man, playing soccer
bunch little kids.

01:08:20 Predicting Aging Rates Pubertal Rates

Full beard know, bald 20. rate maturation, rate aging
interesting. hard know rate aging. genetic tests now can allow
that. Things like Horvath Clocks things sort. Beautiful work David
Sinclair Harvard others pointed this. speed entry exit
puberty might be, putting hypothesis. Might interesting
window, fast one going aging developmental arc.
development course, doesn't just start birth end puberty. continues
entire life. think interesting. will often see people, boys girls.
say boys girls, will develop secondary sexual characteristics different rates.
sometimes sequential. know might see kid will, grow tall
big growth spurt, breast development will come little bit later.
features will come little bit later. can also see boys.
person referred earlier, friend developed full beard, know, went
bald. also quite muscular, great athlete. went puberty
exceedingly fast. people go slowly. people will go
puberty age 14, won't start accumulate facial hair much, much later.
voice will change first, early. won't get secondary
sexual characteristics much later. so, don't really know impacts
relates overall trajectory rate aging. interesting thing think
every one us. going offer opportunity experiment
today,

another,

00:49:42 Cannabis, Alcohol: Babies, Puberty & Adults

turns nature far interesting that. Okay,
things impact sexual development early life later life. talk
cannabis. talk alcohol dare say talk cell phones. Something
never thought ever do, either podcast classroom. But,
days really interesting data. think aware them. First
all, cannabis, marijuana, THC. realize now lot different variance
this. lot different strains cannabis. personally not pot smoker.
just not me. not talking moral legal implications, States
decriminalized, places really illegal places basically legal.
check, know live understand laws. not
about. know however, exception one study
many studies point fact THC things cannabis promote
significant increases aromatase activity. Now pot smokers aren't going like this,
especially male pot smokers aren't going like reality. Remember,
hearing background Costello snoring really loud? put
screen? not cannabis smoker, can imagine why. Come Costello.
Come buddy, come here. asleep. Come here. [indistinct],
go. dog definitely not need cannabis. state time.
highly... Oh asleep still. asked see Costello just
listening audio, maybe gives [Costello grunts] Oh, okay. going let
get back sleep. always here, asked see him. Costello's not
pot smoker either. dog sitter pot smoker years ago.
favorite dog sitter but, not pot smoker. Again, no judgment. deal.
cannabis, not clear THC elements marijuana plant,
promote aromatase activity. Now, observed anecdotally pot
smokers higher incidence developing something mentioned
gynecomastia, breast bud development. full-blown breast development males.
may women want increase estrogenic activity. Remember
females make testosterone. comes adrenals, right? don't testes.
comes adrenals testosterone can also aromatized. Although


typically aromatase activity referring examples
males. testosterone can increase estrogenic activity. might say, "Oh
know, therefore testosterone reduce sexual behavior? create sorts
things related low testosterone?" Not necessarily, not necessarily.
why, estrogen males females important things like libido sexual
behavior. going repeat that. estrogen low males, can actually inhibit
libido sexual behavior. don't want estrogen high low. Whether
not male female. Now course females, estrogen levels tend higher
males. speaking generally here. just think back chromosomal
sex. referring say male female, although nuance
course. females, testosterone comes adrenals
powerful effect libido desire reproduce. next episode, going
talk works relationship birth control, relationship
menopause. also going talk whole thing works males well.
cannabis aspects marijuana plant can impact levels testosterone
estrogen increasing aromatase. people aware that. well,
good data. able find several studies PubMed, pointing fact
smoking marijuana pregnancy can shift pattern hormones
developing fetus, promotes estrogenic outcomes. Now earlier said
estrogen masculinized male brain, utero true, way
cannabis seems work, least studies able identify
promotes circulating estrogen body therefore can counteract
masculinizing effects things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone, primary
secondary sexual characteristics. mention because, know think nowadays
marijuana use far widespread certainly puberty can profound
effects hormonal systems. another episode, goes really
deep this. yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity increasing aromatase.
Almost everyone can appreciate drinking pregnancy, not good
developing fetus. Fetal alcohol syndrome well-established negative outcome
pregnancy. something cognitive effects really bad.
actually physical malformation, et cetera. drinking pregnancy, not good.
Probably drinking puberty, not good either. alcohol, particular certain
things like beer grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity. Now, isn't
just protecting young boys estrogenic activity. also protecting girls


excessive even hypo estrogenic effects alcohol puberty. Now, many teenagers
drink. College students drink important point puberty doesn't start
one day end another day, puberty beginning middle end,
development really entire lifespan. idea know, puberty know
open close. just false.

Looked hormone profiles people based proximity phone frequency

lived to, guess called radio-frequency towers. base stations.
looking effects radio frequency radiation RFR human hormone

good." need morning cortisol bump order wake up. Morning cortisol
good. also thyroid hormones significantly reduced. Prolactin young
females, definitely concerning testosterone levels males females.
so, now quite good data showing close phone much
day close interesting question living near one base stations
apparently can effects hormone profiles. see study like one
always ask, "Well, things also effects
hormone profiles?" Right? Cause imagine ran study
people live close waterway, close highway lot exhaust
buses cars, might see similar effects. take sorts
studies grain salt. think interesting. given last time
looked data way back junior professor like
one two studies find. One studies pointed increases
testosterone rats, close proximity radio-frequency

really wasn't conclusion takeaway that. Now, pretty impressive


amount data pointing fact effects things hormones.
don't know information. not going stop using phone but,
light work Tyrone Hayes others looking sperm counts looking

01:02:33 Beards & Baldness Patterns Around World, DHT, 5-alpha-reductase

hard explain declines simply basis cell phone use.
interesting effects hormones actually can observe
outside people, tell something not just level hormones, also
underlying genetics. relate beard growth baldness.
fascinating. molecule, hormone dihydrotestosterone, made testosterone,
hormone primarily responsible facial hair, beard growth. well,
molecule, hormone primarily responsible lack hair head, hair loss.
work? Well, DHT circulates body binds DHT receptors
face promote hair growth. binds DHD receptors scalp promote
hair loss. Not incidentally, drugs designed prevent hair loss 5-alpha-
reductase inhibitors. remember 5-alpha-reductase Guevedoces? Well,
people discovered Güevedoces, went lot research
underlying biochemistry really interesting molecule dihydrotestosterone.
identified 5-alpha-reductase. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors basis
anti-hair loss treatments there. interesting things
here. First all, side effect profiles treatments hair loss quite severe
many individuals. Remember DHT primary androgen libido, strengthened
connective tissue repair, aggression. Even aggression course held
check, just sort ambition aggression related dopamine, within
testosterone pathway, less pure testosterone, although pure testosterone
effects. DHT is, least primate species including humans, dominant
androgen sorts effects. look somebody, everyone can
predict whether not going go bald based looking their, always
taught mother's father. mother's father bald, higher
probability going go bald. pattern DHT receptors scalp, will


dictate whether not going go bald everywhere just front
called crown type baldness. density beard tells density
DHT receptors. Now varies background, genetic background. actually
around world nowadays, people travel people form couples
kids many different people different mixed cultures. seeing starting
disappear. areas areas world men seem
pattern baldness, like strip baldness center, hair still
sides full beards. patterns DHT receptors
genetically determined. Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still high, DHT levels
blood can high yet people will light beards no beards.
don't lot DHT receptors face. still
cultures see people huge beard, tons beard. beards growing
way eyes huge heads hair.
lot DHT receptors face not scalp. lot
effects DHT can just see male phenotypes. interesting
hair loss drugs are, prevent hair loss drugs, directly aimed preventing
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone.
extent prevent hair loss, also extent have, bunch side effects
associated low DHT.

01:06:39 Creatine & DHT/Hair Loss

Along lines particular sports supplement lot people use called
Creatine. Creatine, now lot research showing Creatine can bring
water muscle. can support strength. number things.
Might even important cognitive promoting. Cognitive enhancement effects,
although mild. studies show can significant. people, not
anecdotal, report creatine promotes hair loss. differs individual.
people true, others no. yes appear, based studies able
find PubMed, creatine promote 5-alpha-reductase activity therefore
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone. makes sense
might promote degree hair loss, well beard growth, well
effects DHT. recall junior high school middle school, going home one Summer
seventh grade, coming back eighth grade kid knew


friends with, went like young kid to, like grown man, full
beard. amazing. like completely transformed. puberty
said before, without doubt accelerated rate development will
go point lives. Even faster infancy just terms huge
number different cognitive changes physical changes. Not surprisingly
individual mostly bald early twenties. must
just exceedingly high levels DHT. also played soccer kid
basically like dribbling past everybody. like grown man, playing soccer
bunch little kids.

01:08:20 Predicting Aging Rates Pubertal Rates

Full beard know, bald 20. rate maturation, rate aging
interesting. hard know rate aging. genetic tests now can allow
that. Things like Horvath Clocks things sort. Beautiful work David
Sinclair Harvard others pointed this. speed entry exit
puberty might be, putting hypothesis. Might interesting
window, fast one going aging developmental arc.
development course, doesn't just start birth end puberty. continues
entire life. think interesting. will often see people, boys girls.
say boys girls, will develop secondary sexual characteristics different rates.
sometimes sequential. know might see kid will, grow tall
big growth spurt, breast development will come little bit later.
features will come little bit later. can also see boys.
person referred earlier, friend developed full beard, know, went
bald. also quite muscular, great athlete. went puberty
exceedingly fast. people go slowly. people will go
puberty age 14, won't start accumulate facial hair much, much later.
voice will change first, early. won't get secondary
sexual characteristics much later. so, don't really know impacts
relates overall trajectory rate aging. interesting thing think
every one us. going offer opportunity experiment

pot smoker either. dog sitter pot smoker years ago.
favorite dog sitter but, not pot smoker. Again, no judgment. deal.
cannabis, not clear THC elements marijuana plant,
promote aromatase activity. Now, observed anecdotally pot
smokers higher incidence developing something mentioned
gynecomastia, breast bud development. full-blown breast development males.
may women want increase estrogenic activity. Remember
females make testosterone. comes adrenals, right? don't testes.
comes adrenals testosterone can also aromatized. Although


typically aromatase activity referring examples
males. testosterone can increase estrogenic activity. might say, "Oh
know, therefore testosterone reduce sexual behavior? create sorts
things related low testosterone?" Not necessarily, not necessarily.
why, estrogen males females important things like libido sexual
behavior. going repeat that. estrogen low males, can actually inhibit
libido sexual behavior. don't want estrogen high low. Whether
not male female. Now course females, estrogen levels tend higher
males. speaking generally here. just think back chromosomal
sex. referring say male female, although nuance
course. females, testosterone comes adrenals
powerful effect libido desire reproduce. next episode, going
talk works relationship birth control, relationship
menopause. also going talk whole thing works males well.
cannabis aspects marijuana plant can impact levels testosterone
estrogen increasing aromatase. people aware that. well,
good data. able find several studies PubMed, pointing fact
smoking marijuana pregnancy can shift pattern hormones
developing fetus, promotes estrogenic outcomes. Now earlier said
estrogen masculinized male brain, utero true, way
cannabis seems work, least studies able identify
promotes circulating estrogen body therefore can counteract
masculinizing effects things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone, primary
secondary sexual characteristics. mention because, know think nowadays
marijuana use far widespread certainly puberty can profound
effects hormonal systems. another episode, goes really
deep this. yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity increasing aromatase.
Almost everyone can appreciate drinking pregnancy, not good
developing fetus. Fetal alcohol syndrome well-established negative outcome
pregnancy. something cognitive effects really bad.
actually physical malformation, et cetera. drinking pregnancy, not good.
Probably drinking puberty, not good either. alcohol, particular certain
things like beer grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity. Now, isn't
just protecting young boys estrogenic activity. also protecting girls


excessive even hypo estrogenic effects alcohol puberty. Now, many teenagers
drink. College students drink important point puberty doesn't start
one day end another day, puberty beginning middle end,
development really entire lifespan. idea know, puberty know
open close. just false.

00:56:25 Cell Phone Technology: Effects Hormones, Ovaries, & Testicles

Okay, talked cannabis. talked alcohol. talk cell
phones. First all, use cell phone. use often. not think evil
devices. think require discipline order make sure not
become negative force one's life. personally restrict number hours
phone particular social media. answer email particular
times day. cell phone itself? know, junior
professor. pre-tenure early professor. taught class neural circuits
health disease. one students asked me, know cell phones safe
brain? know, data point fact were. least
no data showing wasn't. still don't answer that, frankly.
don't see lot studies it. not personally aware evidence quality
peer reviewed studies showing cell phones bad brain holding
phone ear bad Bluetooth bad that. just not aware
quality studies. aware quality studies, peer reviewed study please reference
them, put comment section. Send me, however like. love
see them. not aware them. However, interested particular study
published back 2013 rats. basically took cell phone put
cage rats looked basically testicular ovarian development rats
saw minor still statistically significant defects ovarian testicular
development. Since now returning literature, seen absolute
explosion studies. quality journals,
call not blue ribbon journals. Identifying defects testicular ovarian
development mere exposure cell phone emitted waves. just call that, don't
know are. sounds almost crazy, right? Anytime somebody starts
talking EMS things like that, kind worry like, person okay?
look, literature pointing direction chronic exposure gonads


cell phones creating serious issues terms health cellular level
terms output. output testes sperm production.
Swimming speed sperm important feature sperm health. ovaries
estrogenic output. regular cycles are. animals, cycles
little bit different humans. don't menstrual cycle.
estrous cycle, generally around four days. think say based
literature, effects cell phone emitted waves gonadal development.
question is, proximity cell phone gonads? Now, taken
literature observe it. course point captions.
don't like cell phone pocket, well past puberty,
nonetheless effects seen adult animals. effects now
demonstrated humans. just talk couple
effects. paper published journal, "Clinical Biochemistry" S. Gander et al.
Looked hormone profiles people based proximity phone frequency
phone use, stored phone body. Aa well proximity
lived to, guess called radio-frequency towers. base stations.
looking effects radio frequency radiation RFR human hormone
profiles. show significant decreases cortisol. might say, "Well, might
good." need morning cortisol bump order wake up. Morning cortisol
good. also thyroid hormones significantly reduced. Prolactin young
females, definitely concerning testosterone levels males females.
so, now quite good data showing close phone much
day close interesting question living near one base stations
apparently can effects hormone profiles. see study like one
always ask, "Well, things also effects
hormone profiles?" Right? Cause imagine ran study
people live close waterway, close highway lot exhaust
buses cars, might see similar effects. take sorts
studies grain salt. think interesting. given last time
looked data way back junior professor like
one two studies find. One studies pointed increases
testosterone rats, close proximity radio-frequency
radiation waves. case, showed decreases testosterone.
really wasn't conclusion takeaway that. Now, pretty impressive


amount data pointing fact effects things hormones.
don't know information. not going stop using phone but,
light work Tyrone Hayes others looking sperm counts looking
decrease testosterone levels sperm counts fertility last 20, 30
years, perhaps know, not surprising. Although again, cell phones
smartphones really prominent use mostly within last 10 11 years.

01:02:33 Beards & Baldness Patterns Around World, DHT, 5-alpha-reductase

hard explain declines simply basis cell phone use.
interesting effects hormones actually can observe
outside people, tell something not just level hormones, also
underlying genetics. relate beard growth baldness.
fascinating. molecule, hormone dihydrotestosterone, made testosterone,
hormone primarily responsible facial hair, beard growth. well,
molecule, hormone primarily responsible lack hair head, hair loss.
work? Well, DHT circulates body binds DHT receptors
face promote hair growth. binds DHD receptors scalp promote
hair loss. Not incidentally, drugs designed prevent hair loss 5-alpha-
reductase inhibitors. remember 5-alpha-reductase Guevedoces? Well,
people discovered Güevedoces, went lot research
underlying biochemistry really interesting molecule dihydrotestosterone.
identified 5-alpha-reductase. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors basis
anti-hair loss treatments there. interesting things
here. First all, side effect profiles treatments hair loss quite severe
many individuals. Remember DHT primary androgen libido, strengthened
connective tissue repair, aggression. Even aggression course held
check, just sort ambition aggression related dopamine, within
testosterone pathway, less pure testosterone, although pure testosterone
effects. DHT is, least primate species including humans, dominant
androgen sorts effects. look somebody, everyone can
predict whether not going go bald based looking their, always
taught mother's father. mother's father bald, higher
probability going go bald. pattern DHT receptors scalp, will


dictate whether not going go bald everywhere just front
called crown type baldness. density beard tells density
DHT receptors. Now varies background, genetic background. actually
around world nowadays, people travel people form couples
kids many different people different mixed cultures. seeing starting
disappear. areas areas world men seem
pattern baldness, like strip baldness center, hair still
sides full beards. patterns DHT receptors
genetically determined. Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still high, DHT levels
blood can high yet people will light beards no beards.
don't lot DHT receptors face. still
cultures see people huge beard, tons beard. beards growing
way eyes huge heads hair.
lot DHT receptors face not scalp. lot
effects DHT can just see male phenotypes. interesting
hair loss drugs are, prevent hair loss drugs, directly aimed preventing
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone.
extent prevent hair loss, also extent have, bunch side effects
associated low DHT.

01:06:39 Creatine & DHT/Hair Loss

Along lines particular sports supplement lot people use called
Creatine. Creatine, now lot research showing Creatine can bring
water muscle. can support strength. number things.
Might even important cognitive promoting. Cognitive enhancement effects,
although mild. studies show can significant. people, not
anecdotal, report creatine promotes hair loss. differs individual.
people true, others no. yes appear, based studies able
find PubMed, creatine promote 5-alpha-reductase activity therefore
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone. makes sense
might promote degree hair loss, well beard growth, well
effects DHT. recall junior high school middle school, going home one Summer
seventh grade, coming back eighth grade kid knew


friends with, went like young kid to, like grown man, full
beard. amazing. like completely transformed. puberty
said before, without doubt accelerated rate development will
go point lives. Even faster infancy just terms huge
number different cognitive changes physical changes. Not surprisingly
individual mostly bald early twenties. must
just exceedingly high levels DHT. also played soccer kid
basically like dribbling past everybody. like grown man, playing soccer
bunch little kids.

01:08:20 Predicting Aging Rates Pubertal Rates

Full beard know, bald 20. rate maturation, rate aging
interesting. hard know rate aging. genetic tests now can allow
that. Things like Horvath Clocks things sort. Beautiful work David
Sinclair Harvard others pointed this. speed entry exit
puberty might be, putting hypothesis. Might interesting
window, fast one going aging developmental arc.
development course, doesn't just start birth end puberty. continues
entire life. think interesting. will often see people, boys girls.
say boys girls, will develop secondary sexual characteristics different rates.
sometimes sequential. know might see kid will, grow tall
big growth spurt, breast development will come little bit later.
features will come little bit later. can also see boys.
person referred earlier, friend developed full beard, know, went
bald. also quite muscular, great athlete. went puberty
exceedingly fast. people go slowly. people will go
puberty age 14, won't start accumulate facial hair much, much later.
voice will change first, early. won't get secondary
sexual characteristics much later. so, don't really know impacts
relates overall trajectory rate aging. interesting thing think
every one us. going offer opportunity experiment
today,

something unusual happening individuals XY

testes making testosterone, receptor testosterone mutated.
therefore testes never descend. don't ovaries, testes
testes internal. typically individuals find actually XY
chromosomes. know, chromosomal sex male. will.
gonadal sex male, gonads, testes inside body. don't actually
develop scrotum. don't make ovaries. don't menstruate around
time puberty sign something different. never
menstruate around puberty. look deeply enough, find
actually XY. make testosterone body can't make use
testosterone don't receptors. receptors vitally
important some, secondary sexual characteristics talked
about. Body hair, penis growth puberty et cetera. live fairly happy lives
females. Although course can't conceive, right? don't uterus,


don't ovaries. also general, don't produce sperm quantities enough
actually reproduce somebody else, although sometimes can.
believe not, not going name names actually reports
several people, fairly prominent people throughout history androgen
insensitivity syndrome people suspected did. reason not name names
that, gets right heart whether not male female.
say right? XY chromosomes gonadally testes inside.
yet, looked bodies looked faces, say almost
certainty appeared female. naturally occurring experiment, points
fact testosterone shows body impacts things

again, talking order illustrate principle order
effects, hormone doesn't just present. hormone actually
able bind receptor take action target cells. again, just throw
example people using performance enhancing drugs. Although
pretty broad statement, nowadays lot excitement so-called
SARMs. receptor side. talk future

now augmenting sports performance, testosterone directly also
testosterone derivatives also altering things level receptor
exceedingly interesting revealing us many ways

00:48:41 Estrogen Establishes “Masculine” Brain Circuits, Testosterone

hormones can impact brain body. ways didn't suspect. Perhaps
simplest way understand estrogen testosterone impact masculinization
feminization brain behavior statement. actually closing
sentence abstract colleague Neuronal Shaw Stanford school
medicine published. estrogen, estrogen aromatized
testosterone aromatase, sets masculine repertoire sexual, animals
humans, territorial behaviors. sets circuitry brain. Estrogen
that. Estrogen sets masculine circuitry brain testosterone
controls display behaviors later life. find incredibly
interesting. think just testosterone one thing estrogen


another,

00:49:42 Cannabis, Alcohol: Babies, Puberty & Adults

turns nature far interesting that. Okay,
things impact sexual development early life later life. talk
cannabis. talk alcohol dare say talk cell phones. Something
never thought ever do, either podcast classroom. But,
days really interesting data. think aware them. First
all, cannabis, marijuana, THC. realize now lot different variance
this. lot different strains cannabis. personally not pot smoker.
just not me. not talking moral legal implications, States
decriminalized, places really illegal places basically legal.
check, know live understand laws. not
about. know however, exception one study
many studies point fact THC things cannabis promote
significant increases aromatase activity. Now pot smokers aren't going like this,
especially male pot smokers aren't going like reality. Remember,
hearing background Costello snoring really loud? put
screen? not cannabis smoker, can imagine why. Come Costello.
Come buddy, come here. asleep. Come here. [indistinct],
go. dog definitely not need cannabis. state time.
highly... Oh asleep still. asked see Costello just
listening audio, maybe gives [Costello grunts] Oh, okay. going let
get back sleep. always here, asked see him. Costello's not
pot smoker either. dog sitter pot smoker years ago.
favorite dog sitter but, not pot smoker. Again, no judgment. deal.
cannabis, not clear THC elements marijuana plant,
promote aromatase activity. Now, observed anecdotally pot
smokers higher incidence developing something mentioned
gynecomastia, breast bud development. full-blown breast development males.
may women want increase estrogenic activity. Remember
females make testosterone. comes adrenals, right? don't testes.
comes adrenals testosterone can also aromatized. Although


typically aromatase activity referring examples
males. testosterone can increase estrogenic activity. might say, "Oh
know, therefore testosterone reduce sexual behavior? create sorts
things related low testosterone?" Not necessarily, not necessarily.
why, estrogen males females important things like libido sexual
behavior. going repeat that. estrogen low males, can actually inhibit
libido sexual behavior. don't want estrogen high low. Whether
not male female. Now course females, estrogen levels tend higher
males. speaking generally here. just think back chromosomal
sex. referring say male female, although nuance
course. females, testosterone comes adrenals
powerful effect libido desire reproduce. next episode, going
talk works relationship birth control, relationship
menopause. also going talk whole thing works males well.
cannabis aspects marijuana plant can impact levels testosterone
estrogen increasing aromatase. people aware that. well,
good data. able find several studies PubMed, pointing fact
smoking marijuana pregnancy can shift pattern hormones
developing fetus, promotes estrogenic outcomes. Now earlier said
estrogen masculinized male brain, utero true, way
cannabis seems work, least studies able identify
promotes circulating estrogen body therefore can counteract
masculinizing effects things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone, primary
secondary sexual characteristics. mention because, know think nowadays
marijuana use far widespread certainly puberty can profound
effects hormonal systems. another episode, goes really
deep this. yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity increasing aromatase.
Almost everyone can appreciate drinking pregnancy, not good
developing fetus. Fetal alcohol syndrome well-established negative outcome
pregnancy. something cognitive effects really bad.
actually physical malformation, et cetera. drinking pregnancy, not good.
Probably drinking puberty, not good either. alcohol, particular certain
things like beer grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity. Now, isn't
just protecting young boys estrogenic activity. also protecting girls


excessive even hypo estrogenic effects alcohol puberty. Now, many teenagers
drink. College students drink important point puberty doesn't start
one day end another day, puberty beginning middle end,
development really entire lifespan. idea know, puberty know
open close. just false.

00:56:25 Cell Phone Technology: Effects Hormones, Ovaries, & Testicles

Okay, talked cannabis. talked alcohol. talk cell
phones. First all, use cell phone. use often. not think evil
devices. think require discipline order make sure not
become negative force one's life. personally restrict number hours
phone particular social media. answer email particular
times day. cell phone itself? know, junior
professor. pre-tenure early professor. taught class neural circuits
health disease. one students asked me, know cell phones safe
brain? know, data point fact were. least
no data showing wasn't. still don't answer that, frankly.
don't see lot studies it. not personally aware evidence quality
peer reviewed studies showing cell phones bad brain holding
phone ear bad Bluetooth bad that. just not aware
quality studies. aware quality studies, peer reviewed study please reference
them, put comment section. Send me, however like. love
see them. not aware them. However, interested particular study
published back 2013 rats. basically took cell phone put
cage rats looked basically testicular ovarian development rats
saw minor still statistically significant defects ovarian testicular
development. Since now returning literature, seen absolute
explosion studies. quality journals,
call not blue ribbon journals. Identifying defects testicular ovarian
development mere exposure cell phone emitted waves. just call that, don't
know are. sounds almost crazy, right? Anytime somebody starts
talking EMS things like that, kind worry like, person okay?
look, literature pointing direction chronic exposure gonads


cell phones creating serious issues terms health cellular level
terms output. output testes sperm production.
Swimming speed sperm important feature sperm health. ovaries
estrogenic output. regular cycles are. animals, cycles
little bit different humans. don't menstrual cycle.
estrous cycle, generally around four days. think say based
literature, effects cell phone emitted waves gonadal development.
question is, proximity cell phone gonads? Now, taken
literature observe it. course point captions.
don't like cell phone pocket, well past puberty,
nonetheless effects seen adult animals. effects now
demonstrated humans. just talk couple
effects. paper published journal, "Clinical Biochemistry" S. Gander et al.
Looked hormone profiles people based proximity phone frequency
phone use, stored phone body. Aa well proximity
lived to, guess called radio-frequency towers. base stations.
looking effects radio frequency radiation RFR human hormone
profiles. show significant decreases cortisol. might say, "Well, might
good." need morning cortisol bump order wake up. Morning cortisol
good. also thyroid hormones significantly reduced. Prolactin young
females, definitely concerning testosterone levels males females.
so, now quite good data showing close phone much
day close interesting question living near one base stations
apparently can effects hormone profiles. see study like one
always ask, "Well, things also effects
hormone profiles?" Right? Cause imagine ran study
people live close waterway, close highway lot exhaust
buses cars, might see similar effects. take sorts
studies grain salt. think interesting. given last time
looked data way back junior professor like
one two studies find. One studies pointed increases
testosterone rats, close proximity radio-frequency
radiation waves. case, showed decreases testosterone.
really wasn't conclusion takeaway that. Now, pretty impressive


amount data pointing fact effects things hormones.
don't know information. not going stop using phone but,
light work Tyrone Hayes others looking sperm counts looking
decrease testosterone levels sperm counts fertility last 20, 30
years, perhaps know, not surprising. Although again, cell phones
smartphones really prominent use mostly within last 10 11 years.

01:02:33 Beards & Baldness Patterns Around World, DHT, 5-alpha-reductase

hard explain declines simply basis cell phone use.
interesting effects hormones actually can observe
outside people, tell something not just level hormones, also
underlying genetics. relate beard growth baldness.
fascinating. molecule, hormone dihydrotestosterone, made testosterone,
hormone primarily responsible facial hair, beard growth. well,
molecule, hormone primarily responsible lack hair head, hair loss.
work? Well, DHT circulates body binds DHT receptors
face promote hair growth. binds DHD receptors scalp promote
hair loss. Not incidentally, drugs designed prevent hair loss 5-alpha-
reductase inhibitors. remember 5-alpha-reductase Guevedoces? Well,
people discovered Güevedoces, went lot research
underlying biochemistry really interesting molecule dihydrotestosterone.
identified 5-alpha-reductase. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors basis
anti-hair loss treatments there. interesting things
here. First all, side effect profiles treatments hair loss quite severe
many individuals. Remember DHT primary androgen libido, strengthened
connective tissue repair, aggression. Even aggression course held
check, just sort ambition aggression related dopamine, within
testosterone pathway, less pure testosterone, although pure testosterone
effects. DHT is, least primate species including humans, dominant
androgen sorts effects. look somebody, everyone can
predict whether not going go bald based looking their, always
taught mother's father. mother's father bald, higher
probability going go bald. pattern DHT receptors scalp, will


dictate whether not going go bald everywhere just front
called crown type baldness. density beard tells density
DHT receptors. Now varies background, genetic background. actually
around world nowadays, people travel people form couples
kids many different people different mixed cultures. seeing starting
disappear. areas areas world men seem
pattern baldness, like strip baldness center, hair still
sides full beards. patterns DHT receptors
genetically determined. Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still high, DHT levels
blood can high yet people will light beards no beards.
don't lot DHT receptors face. still
cultures see people huge beard, tons beard. beards growing
way eyes huge heads hair.
lot DHT receptors face not scalp. lot
effects DHT can just see male phenotypes. interesting
hair loss drugs are, prevent hair loss drugs, directly aimed preventing
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone.
extent prevent hair loss, also extent have, bunch side effects
associated low DHT.

01:06:39 Creatine & DHT/Hair Loss

Along lines particular sports supplement lot people use called
Creatine. Creatine, now lot research showing Creatine can bring
water muscle. can support strength. number things.
Might even important cognitive promoting. Cognitive enhancement effects,
although mild. studies show can significant. people, not
anecdotal, report creatine promotes hair loss. differs individual.
people true, others no. yes appear, based studies able
find PubMed, creatine promote 5-alpha-reductase activity therefore
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone. makes sense
might promote degree hair loss, well beard growth, well
effects DHT. recall junior high school middle school, going home one Summer
seventh grade, coming back eighth grade kid knew


friends with, went like young kid to, like grown man, full
beard. amazing. like completely transformed. puberty
said before, without doubt accelerated rate development will
go point lives. Even faster infancy just terms huge
number different cognitive changes physical changes. Not surprisingly
individual mostly bald early twenties. must
just exceedingly high levels DHT. also played soccer kid
basically like dribbling past everybody. like grown man, playing soccer
bunch little kids.

01:08:20 Predicting Aging Rates Pubertal Rates

Full beard know, bald 20. rate maturation, rate aging
interesting. hard know rate aging. genetic tests now can allow
that. Things like Horvath Clocks things sort. Beautiful work David
Sinclair Harvard others pointed this. speed entry exit
puberty might be, putting hypothesis. Might interesting
window, fast one going aging developmental arc.
development course, doesn't just start birth end puberty. continues
entire life. think interesting. will often see people, boys girls.
say boys girls, will develop secondary sexual characteristics different rates.
sometimes sequential. know might see kid will, grow tall
big growth spurt, breast development will come little bit later.
features will come little bit later. can also see boys.
person referred earlier, friend developed full beard, know, went
bald. also quite muscular, great athlete. went puberty
exceedingly fast. people go slowly. people will go
puberty age 14, won't start accumulate facial hair much, much later.
voice will change first, early. won't get secondary
sexual characteristics much later. so, don't really know impacts
relates overall trajectory rate aging. interesting thing think
every one us. going offer opportunity experiment
today,



01:10:04 Hyenas, Baseball, & Hypertrophied Clitorises: Androstenedione

another,

00:49:42 Cannabis, Alcohol: Babies, Puberty & Adults

turns nature far interesting that. Okay,
things impact sexual development early life later life. talk
cannabis. talk alcohol dare say talk cell phones. Something
never thought ever do, either podcast classroom. But,
days really interesting data. think aware them. First
all, cannabis, marijuana, THC. realize now lot different variance
this. lot different strains cannabis. personally not pot smoker.
just not me. not talking moral legal implications, States
decriminalized, places really illegal places basically legal.
check, know live understand laws. not
about. know however, exception one study
many studies point fact THC things cannabis promote
significant increases aromatase activity. Now pot smokers aren't going like this,
especially male pot smokers aren't going like reality. Remember,
hearing background Costello snoring really loud? put
screen? not cannabis smoker, can imagine why. Come Costello.
Come buddy, come here. asleep. Come here. [indistinct],
go. dog definitely not need cannabis. state time.
highly... Oh asleep still. asked see Costello just
listening audio, maybe gives [Costello grunts] Oh, okay. going let
get back sleep. always here, asked see him. Costello's not
pot smoker either. dog sitter pot smoker years ago.
favorite dog sitter but, not pot smoker. Again, no judgment. deal.
cannabis, not clear THC elements marijuana plant,
promote aromatase activity. Now, observed anecdotally pot
smokers higher incidence developing something mentioned
gynecomastia, breast bud development. full-blown breast development males.
may women want increase estrogenic activity. Remember
females make testosterone. comes adrenals, right? don't testes.
comes adrenals testosterone can also aromatized. Although


typically aromatase activity referring examples
males. testosterone can increase estrogenic activity. might say, "Oh
know, therefore testosterone reduce sexual behavior? create sorts
things related low testosterone?" Not necessarily, not necessarily.
why, estrogen males females important things like libido sexual
behavior. going repeat that. estrogen low males, can actually inhibit
libido sexual behavior. don't want estrogen high low. Whether
not male female. Now course females, estrogen levels tend higher
males. speaking generally here. just think back chromosomal
sex. referring say male female, although nuance
course. females, testosterone comes adrenals
powerful effect libido desire reproduce. next episode, going
talk works relationship birth control, relationship
menopause. also going talk whole thing works males well.
cannabis aspects marijuana plant can impact levels testosterone
estrogen increasing aromatase. people aware that. well,
good data. able find several studies PubMed, pointing fact
smoking marijuana pregnancy can shift pattern hormones
developing fetus, promotes estrogenic outcomes. Now earlier said
estrogen masculinized male brain, utero true, way
cannabis seems work, least studies able identify
promotes circulating estrogen body therefore can counteract
masculinizing effects things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone, primary
secondary sexual characteristics. mention because, know think nowadays
marijuana use far widespread certainly puberty can profound
effects hormonal systems. another episode, goes really
deep this. yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity increasing aromatase.
Almost everyone can appreciate drinking pregnancy, not good
developing fetus. Fetal alcohol syndrome well-established negative outcome
pregnancy. something cognitive effects really bad.
actually physical malformation, et cetera. drinking pregnancy, not good.
Probably drinking puberty, not good either. alcohol, particular certain
things like beer grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity. Now, isn't
just protecting young boys estrogenic activity. also protecting girls


excessive even hypo estrogenic effects alcohol puberty. Now, many teenagers
drink. College students drink important point puberty doesn't start
one day end another day, puberty beginning middle end,
development really entire lifespan. idea know, puberty know
open close. just false.

00:56:25 Cell Phone Technology: Effects Hormones, Ovaries, & Testicles

Okay, talked cannabis. talked alcohol. talk cell
phones. First all, use cell phone. use often. not think evil
devices. think require discipline order make sure not
become negative force one's life. personally restrict number hours
phone particular social media. answer email particular
times day. cell phone itself? know, junior
professor. pre-tenure early professor. taught class neural circuits
health disease. one students asked me, know cell phones safe
brain? know, data point fact were. least
no data showing wasn't. still don't answer that, frankly.
don't see lot studies it. not personally aware evidence quality
peer reviewed studies showing cell phones bad brain holding
phone ear bad Bluetooth bad that. just not aware
quality studies. aware quality studies, peer reviewed study please reference
them, put comment section. Send me, however like. love
see them. not aware them. However, interested particular study
published back 2013 rats. basically took cell phone put
cage rats looked basically testicular ovarian development rats
saw minor still statistically significant defects ovarian testicular
development. Since now returning literature, seen absolute
explosion studies. quality journals,
call not blue ribbon journals. Identifying defects testicular ovarian
development mere exposure cell phone emitted waves. just call that, don't
know are. sounds almost crazy, right? Anytime somebody starts
talking EMS things like that, kind worry like, person okay?
look, literature pointing direction chronic exposure gonads


cell phones creating serious issues terms health cellular level
terms output. output testes sperm production.
Swimming speed sperm important feature sperm health. ovaries
estrogenic output. regular cycles are. animals, cycles
little bit different humans. don't menstrual cycle.
estrous cycle, generally around four days. think say based
literature, effects cell phone emitted waves gonadal development.
question is, proximity cell phone gonads? Now, taken
literature observe it. course point captions.
don't like cell phone pocket, well past puberty,
nonetheless effects seen adult animals. effects now
demonstrated humans. just talk couple
effects. paper published journal, "Clinical Biochemistry" S. Gander et al.
Looked hormone profiles people based proximity phone frequency
phone use, stored phone body. Aa well proximity
lived to, guess called radio-frequency towers. base stations.
looking effects radio frequency radiation RFR human hormone
profiles. show significant decreases cortisol. might say, "Well, might
good." need morning cortisol bump order wake up. Morning cortisol
good. also thyroid hormones significantly reduced. Prolactin young
females, definitely concerning testosterone levels males females.
so, now quite good data showing close phone much
day close interesting question living near one base stations
apparently can effects hormone profiles. see study like one
always ask, "Well, things also effects
hormone profiles?" Right? Cause imagine ran study
people live close waterway, close highway lot exhaust
buses cars, might see similar effects. take sorts
studies grain salt. think interesting. given last time
looked data way back junior professor like
one two studies find. One studies pointed increases
testosterone rats, close proximity radio-frequency
radiation waves. case, showed decreases testosterone.
really wasn't conclusion takeaway that. Now, pretty impressive


amount data pointing fact effects things hormones.
don't know information. not going stop using phone but,
light work Tyrone Hayes others looking sperm counts looking
decrease testosterone levels sperm counts fertility last 20, 30
years, perhaps know, not surprising. Although again, cell phones
smartphones really prominent use mostly within last 10 11 years.

01:02:33 Beards & Baldness Patterns Around World, DHT, 5-alpha-reductase

hard explain declines simply basis cell phone use.
interesting effects hormones actually can observe
outside people, tell something not just level hormones, also
underlying genetics. relate beard growth baldness.
fascinating. molecule, hormone dihydrotestosterone, made testosterone,
hormone primarily responsible facial hair, beard growth. well,
molecule, hormone primarily responsible lack hair head, hair loss.
work? Well, DHT circulates body binds DHT receptors
face promote hair growth. binds DHD receptors scalp promote
hair loss. Not incidentally, drugs designed prevent hair loss 5-alpha-
reductase inhibitors. remember 5-alpha-reductase Guevedoces? Well,
people discovered Güevedoces, went lot research
underlying biochemistry really interesting molecule dihydrotestosterone.
identified 5-alpha-reductase. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors basis
anti-hair loss treatments there. interesting things
here. First all, side effect profiles treatments hair loss quite severe
many individuals. Remember DHT primary androgen libido, strengthened
connective tissue repair, aggression. Even aggression course held
check, just sort ambition aggression related dopamine, within
testosterone pathway, less pure testosterone, although pure testosterone
effects. DHT is, least primate species including humans, dominant
androgen sorts effects. look somebody, everyone can
predict whether not going go bald based looking their, always
taught mother's father. mother's father bald, higher
probability going go bald. pattern DHT receptors scalp, will


dictate whether not going go bald everywhere just front
called crown type baldness. density beard tells density
DHT receptors. Now varies background, genetic background. actually
around world nowadays, people travel people form couples
kids many different people different mixed cultures. seeing starting
disappear. areas areas world men seem
pattern baldness, like strip baldness center, hair still
sides full beards. patterns DHT receptors
genetically determined. Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still high, DHT levels
blood can high yet people will light beards no beards.
don't lot DHT receptors face. still
cultures see people huge beard, tons beard. beards growing
way eyes huge heads hair.
lot DHT receptors face not scalp. lot
effects DHT can just see male phenotypes. interesting
hair loss drugs are, prevent hair loss drugs, directly aimed preventing
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone.
extent prevent hair loss, also extent have, bunch side effects
associated low DHT.

01:06:39 Creatine & DHT/Hair Loss

Along lines particular sports supplement lot people use called
Creatine. Creatine, now lot research showing Creatine can bring
water muscle. can support strength. number things.
Might even important cognitive promoting. Cognitive enhancement effects,
although mild. studies show can significant. people, not
anecdotal, report creatine promotes hair loss. differs individual.
people true, others no. yes appear, based studies able
find PubMed, creatine promote 5-alpha-reductase activity therefore
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone. makes sense
might promote degree hair loss, well beard growth, well
effects DHT. recall junior high school middle school, going home one Summer
seventh grade, coming back eighth grade kid knew


friends with, went like young kid to, like grown man, full
beard. amazing. like completely transformed. puberty
said before, without doubt accelerated rate development will
go point lives. Even faster infancy just terms huge
number different cognitive changes physical changes. Not surprisingly
individual mostly bald early twenties. must
just exceedingly high levels DHT. also played soccer kid
basically like dribbling past everybody. like grown man, playing soccer
bunch little kids.

01:08:20 Predicting Aging Rates Pubertal Rates

Full beard know, bald 20. rate maturation, rate aging
interesting. hard know rate aging. genetic tests now can allow
that. Things like Horvath Clocks things sort. Beautiful work David
Sinclair Harvard others pointed this. speed entry exit
puberty might be, putting hypothesis. Might interesting
window, fast one going aging developmental arc.
development course, doesn't just start birth end puberty. continues
entire life. think interesting. will often see people, boys girls.
say boys girls, will develop secondary sexual characteristics different rates.
sometimes sequential. know might see kid will, grow tall
big growth spurt, breast development will come little bit later.
features will come little bit later. can also see boys.
person referred earlier, friend developed full beard, know, went
bald. also quite muscular, great athlete. went puberty
exceedingly fast. people go slowly. people will go
puberty age 14, won't start accumulate facial hair much, much later.
voice will change first, early. won't get secondary
sexual characteristics much later. so, don't really know impacts
relates overall trajectory rate aging. interesting thing think
every one us. going offer opportunity experiment
today,

another,

00:49:42 Cannabis, Alcohol: Babies, Puberty & Adults

turns nature far interesting that. Okay,
things impact sexual development early life later life. talk
cannabis. talk alcohol dare say talk cell phones. Something
never thought ever do, either podcast classroom. But,
days really interesting data. think aware them. First
all, cannabis, marijuana, THC. realize now lot different variance
this. lot different strains cannabis. personally not pot smoker.
just not me. not talking moral legal implications, States
decriminalized, places really illegal places basically legal.
check, know live understand laws. not
about. know however, exception one study
many studies point fact THC things cannabis promote
significant increases aromatase activity. Now pot smokers aren't going like this,
especially male pot smokers aren't going like reality. Remember,
hearing background Costello snoring really loud? put
screen? not cannabis smoker, can imagine why. Come Costello.
Come buddy, come here. asleep. Come here. [indistinct],
go. dog definitely not need cannabis. state time.
highly... Oh asleep still. asked see Costello just
listening audio, maybe gives [Costello grunts] Oh, okay. going let
get back sleep. always here, asked see him. Costello's not
pot smoker either. dog sitter pot smoker years ago.
favorite dog sitter but, not pot smoker. Again, no judgment. deal.
cannabis, not clear THC elements marijuana plant,
promote aromatase activity. Now, observed anecdotally pot
smokers higher incidence developing something mentioned
gynecomastia, breast bud development. full-blown breast development males.
may women want increase estrogenic activity. Remember
females make testosterone. comes adrenals, right? don't testes.
comes adrenals testosterone can also aromatized. Although


typically aromatase activity referring examples
males. testosterone can increase estrogenic activity. might say, "Oh
know, therefore testosterone reduce sexual behavior? create sorts
things related low testosterone?" Not necessarily, not necessarily.
why, estrogen males females important things like libido sexual
behavior. going repeat that. estrogen low males, can actually inhibit
libido sexual behavior. don't want estrogen high low. Whether
not male female. Now course females, estrogen levels tend higher
males. speaking generally here. just think back chromosomal
sex. referring say male female, although nuance
course. females, testosterone comes adrenals
powerful effect libido desire reproduce. next episode, going
talk works relationship birth control, relationship
menopause. also going talk whole thing works males well.
cannabis aspects marijuana plant can impact levels testosterone
estrogen increasing aromatase. people aware that. well,
good data. able find several studies PubMed, pointing fact
smoking marijuana pregnancy can shift pattern hormones
developing fetus, promotes estrogenic outcomes. Now earlier said
estrogen masculinized male brain, utero true, way
cannabis seems work, least studies able identify
promotes circulating estrogen body therefore can counteract
masculinizing effects things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone, primary
secondary sexual characteristics. mention because, know think nowadays
marijuana use far widespread certainly puberty can profound
effects hormonal systems. another episode, goes really
deep this. yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity increasing aromatase.
Almost everyone can appreciate drinking pregnancy, not good
developing fetus. Fetal alcohol syndrome well-established negative outcome
pregnancy. something cognitive effects really bad.
actually physical malformation, et cetera. drinking pregnancy, not good.
Probably drinking puberty, not good either. alcohol, particular certain
things like beer grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity. Now, isn't
just protecting young boys estrogenic activity. also protecting girls


excessive even hypo estrogenic effects alcohol puberty. Now, many teenagers
drink. College students drink important point puberty doesn't start
one day end another day, puberty beginning middle end,
development really entire lifespan. idea know, puberty know
open close. just false.

00:56:25 Cell Phone Technology: Effects Hormones, Ovaries, & Testicles

Okay, talked cannabis. talked alcohol. talk cell
phones. First all, use cell phone. use often. not think evil
devices. think require discipline order make sure not
become negative force one's life. personally restrict number hours
phone particular social media. answer email particular
times day. cell phone itself? know, junior
professor. pre-tenure early professor. taught class neural circuits
health disease. one students asked me, know cell phones safe
brain? know, data point fact were. least
no data showing wasn't. still don't answer that, frankly.
don't see lot studies it. not personally aware evidence quality
peer reviewed studies showing cell phones bad brain holding
phone ear bad Bluetooth bad that. just not aware
quality studies. aware quality studies, peer reviewed study please reference
them, put comment section. Send me, however like. love
see them. not aware them. However, interested particular study
published back 2013 rats. basically took cell phone put
cage rats looked basically testicular ovarian development rats
saw minor still statistically significant defects ovarian testicular
development. Since now returning literature, seen absolute
explosion studies. quality journals,
call not blue ribbon journals. Identifying defects testicular ovarian
development mere exposure cell phone emitted waves. just call that, don't
know are. sounds almost crazy, right? Anytime somebody starts
talking EMS things like that, kind worry like, person okay?
look, literature pointing direction chronic exposure gonads


cell phones creating serious issues terms health cellular level
terms output. output testes sperm production.
Swimming speed sperm important feature sperm health. ovaries
estrogenic output. regular cycles are. animals, cycles
little bit different humans. don't menstrual cycle.
estrous cycle, generally around four days. think say based
literature, effects cell phone emitted waves gonadal development.
question is, proximity cell phone gonads? Now, taken
literature observe it. course point captions.
don't like cell phone pocket, well past puberty,
nonetheless effects seen adult animals. effects now
demonstrated humans. just talk couple
effects. paper published journal, "Clinical Biochemistry" S. Gander et al.
Looked hormone profiles people based proximity phone frequency
phone use, stored phone body. Aa well proximity
lived to, guess called radio-frequency towers. base stations.
looking effects radio frequency radiation RFR human hormone
profiles. show significant decreases cortisol. might say, "Well, might
good." need morning cortisol bump order wake up. Morning cortisol
good. also thyroid hormones significantly reduced. Prolactin young
females, definitely concerning testosterone levels males females.
so, now quite good data showing close phone much
day close interesting question living near one base stations
apparently can effects hormone profiles. see study like one
always ask, "Well, things also effects
hormone profiles?" Right? Cause imagine ran study
people live close waterway, close highway lot exhaust
buses cars, might see similar effects. take sorts
studies grain salt. think interesting. given last time
looked data way back junior professor like
one two studies find. One studies pointed increases
testosterone rats, close proximity radio-frequency
radiation waves. case, showed decreases testosterone.
really wasn't conclusion takeaway that. Now, pretty impressive


amount data pointing fact effects things hormones.
don't know information. not going stop using phone but,
light work Tyrone Hayes others looking sperm counts looking
decrease testosterone levels sperm counts fertility last 20, 30
years, perhaps know, not surprising. Although again, cell phones
smartphones really prominent use mostly within last 10 11 years.

01:02:33 Beards & Baldness Patterns Around World, DHT, 5-alpha-reductase

hard explain declines simply basis cell phone use.
interesting effects hormones actually can observe
outside people, tell something not just level hormones, also
underlying genetics. relate beard growth baldness.
fascinating. molecule, hormone dihydrotestosterone, made testosterone,
hormone primarily responsible facial hair, beard growth. well,
molecule, hormone primarily responsible lack hair head, hair loss.
work? Well, DHT circulates body binds DHT receptors
face promote hair growth. binds DHD receptors scalp promote
hair loss. Not incidentally, drugs designed prevent hair loss 5-alpha-
reductase inhibitors. remember 5-alpha-reductase Guevedoces? Well,
people discovered Güevedoces, went lot research
underlying biochemistry really interesting molecule dihydrotestosterone.
identified 5-alpha-reductase. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors basis
anti-hair loss treatments there. interesting things
here. First all, side effect profiles treatments hair loss quite severe
many individuals. Remember DHT primary androgen libido, strengthened
connective tissue repair, aggression. Even aggression course held
check, just sort ambition aggression related dopamine, within
testosterone pathway, less pure testosterone, although pure testosterone
effects. DHT is, least primate species including humans, dominant
androgen sorts effects. look somebody, everyone can
predict whether not going go bald based looking their, always
taught mother's father. mother's father bald, higher
probability going go bald. pattern DHT receptors scalp, will


dictate whether not going go bald everywhere just front
called crown type baldness. density beard tells density
DHT receptors. Now varies background, genetic background. actually
around world nowadays, people travel people form couples
kids many different people different mixed cultures. seeing starting
disappear. areas areas world men seem
pattern baldness, like strip baldness center, hair still
sides full beards. patterns DHT receptors
genetically determined. Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still high, DHT levels
blood can high yet people will light beards no beards.
don't lot DHT receptors face. still
cultures see people huge beard, tons beard. beards growing
way eyes huge heads hair.
lot DHT receptors face not scalp. lot
effects DHT can just see male phenotypes. interesting
hair loss drugs are, prevent hair loss drugs, directly aimed preventing
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone.
extent prevent hair loss, also extent have, bunch side effects
associated low DHT.

01:06:39 Creatine & DHT/Hair Loss

Along lines particular sports supplement lot people use called
Creatine. Creatine, now lot research showing Creatine can bring
water muscle. can support strength. number things.
Might even important cognitive promoting. Cognitive enhancement effects,
although mild. studies show can significant. people, not
anecdotal, report creatine promotes hair loss. differs individual.
people true, others no. yes appear, based studies able
find PubMed, creatine promote 5-alpha-reductase activity therefore
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone. makes sense
might promote degree hair loss, well beard growth, well
effects DHT. recall junior high school middle school, going home one Summer
seventh grade, coming back eighth grade kid knew


friends with, went like young kid to, like grown man, full
beard. amazing. like completely transformed. puberty
said before, without doubt accelerated rate development will
go point lives. Even faster infancy just terms huge
number different cognitive changes physical changes. Not surprisingly
individual mostly bald early twenties. must
just exceedingly high levels DHT. also played soccer kid
basically like dribbling past everybody. like grown man, playing soccer
bunch little kids.

01:08:20 Predicting Aging Rates Pubertal Rates

Full beard know, bald 20. rate maturation, rate aging
interesting. hard know rate aging. genetic tests now can allow
that. Things like Horvath Clocks things sort. Beautiful work David
Sinclair Harvard others pointed this. speed entry exit
puberty might be, putting hypothesis. Might interesting
window, fast one going aging developmental arc.
development course, doesn't just start birth end puberty. continues
entire life. think interesting. will often see people, boys girls.
say boys girls, will develop secondary sexual characteristics different rates.
sometimes sequential. know might see kid will, grow tall
big growth spurt, breast development will come little bit later.
features will come little bit later. can also see boys.
person referred earlier, friend developed full beard, know, went
bald. also quite muscular, great athlete. went puberty
exceedingly fast. people go slowly. people will go
puberty age 14, won't start accumulate facial hair much, much later.
voice will change first, early. won't get secondary
sexual characteristics much later. so, don't really know impacts
relates overall trajectory rate aging. interesting thing think
every one us. going offer opportunity experiment
today,

inhibiting hormone. However, individuals look completely female. general,
report feeling like girls young, women older.
something unusual happening individuals XY
chromosomal type not XX. happening? Well happening
testes making testosterone, receptor testosterone mutated.
therefore testes never descend. don't ovaries, testes
testes internal. typically individuals find actually XY
chromosomes. know, chromosomal sex male. will.
gonadal sex male, gonads, testes inside body. don't actually
develop scrotum. don't make ovaries. don't menstruate around
time puberty sign something different. never
menstruate around puberty. look deeply enough, find
actually XY. make testosterone body can't make use
testosterone don't receptors. receptors vitally
important some, secondary sexual characteristics talked
about. Body hair, penis growth puberty et cetera. live fairly happy lives
females. Although course can't conceive, right? don't uterus,


don't ovaries. also general, don't produce sperm quantities enough
actually reproduce somebody else, although sometimes can.
believe not, not going name names actually reports
several people, fairly prominent people throughout history androgen
insensitivity syndrome people suspected did. reason not name names
that, gets right heart whether not male female.
say right? XY chromosomes gonadally testes inside.
yet, looked bodies looked faces, say almost
certainty appeared female. naturally occurring experiment, points
fact testosterone shows body impacts things
levels receptor profound effect phenotype. external body plan.
again, talking order illustrate principle order
effects, hormone doesn't just present. hormone actually
able bind receptor take action target cells. again, just throw
example people using performance enhancing drugs. Although
pretty broad statement, nowadays lot excitement so-called
SARMs. receptor side. talk future
episode. just say teaser SARMs happening right
now augmenting sports performance, testosterone directly also
testosterone derivatives also altering things level receptor
exceedingly interesting revealing us many ways

00:48:41 Estrogen Establishes “Masculine” Brain Circuits, Testosterone

hormones can impact brain body. ways didn't suspect. Perhaps
simplest way understand estrogen testosterone impact masculinization
feminization brain behavior statement. actually closing
sentence abstract colleague Neuronal Shaw Stanford school
medicine published. estrogen, estrogen aromatized
testosterone aromatase, sets masculine repertoire sexual, animals
humans, territorial behaviors. sets circuitry brain. Estrogen
that. Estrogen sets masculine circuitry brain testosterone
controls display behaviors later life. find incredibly
interesting. think just testosterone one thing estrogen


another,

00:49:42 Cannabis, Alcohol: Babies, Puberty & Adults

turns nature far interesting that. Okay,
things impact sexual development early life later life. talk
cannabis. talk alcohol dare say talk cell phones. Something
never thought ever do, either podcast classroom. But,
days really interesting data. think aware them. First
all, cannabis, marijuana, THC. realize now lot different variance
this. lot different strains cannabis. personally not pot smoker.
just not me. not talking moral legal implications, States
decriminalized, places really illegal places basically legal.
check, know live understand laws. not
about. know however, exception one study
many studies point fact THC things cannabis promote
significant increases aromatase activity. Now pot smokers aren't going like this,
especially male pot smokers aren't going like reality. Remember,
hearing background Costello snoring really loud? put
screen? not cannabis smoker, can imagine why. Come Costello.
Come buddy, come here. asleep. Come here. [indistinct],
go. dog definitely not need cannabis. state time.
highly... Oh asleep still. asked see Costello just
listening audio, maybe gives [Costello grunts] Oh, okay. going let
get back sleep. always here, asked see him. Costello's not
pot smoker either. dog sitter pot smoker years ago.
favorite dog sitter but, not pot smoker. Again, no judgment. deal.
cannabis, not clear THC elements marijuana plant,
promote aromatase activity. Now, observed anecdotally pot
smokers higher incidence developing something mentioned
gynecomastia, breast bud development. full-blown breast development males.
may women want increase estrogenic activity. Remember
females make testosterone. comes adrenals, right? don't testes.
comes adrenals testosterone can also aromatized. Although


typically aromatase activity referring examples
males. testosterone can increase estrogenic activity. might say, "Oh
know, therefore testosterone reduce sexual behavior? create sorts
things related low testosterone?" Not necessarily, not necessarily.
why, estrogen males females important things like libido sexual
behavior. going repeat that. estrogen low males, can actually inhibit
libido sexual behavior. don't want estrogen high low. Whether
not male female. Now course females, estrogen levels tend higher
males. speaking generally here. just think back chromosomal
sex. referring say male female, although nuance
course. females, testosterone comes adrenals
powerful effect libido desire reproduce. next episode, going
talk works relationship birth control, relationship
menopause. also going talk whole thing works males well.
cannabis aspects marijuana plant can impact levels testosterone
estrogen increasing aromatase. people aware that. well,
good data. able find several studies PubMed, pointing fact
smoking marijuana pregnancy can shift pattern hormones
developing fetus, promotes estrogenic outcomes. Now earlier said
estrogen masculinized male brain, utero true, way
cannabis seems work, least studies able identify
promotes circulating estrogen body therefore can counteract
masculinizing effects things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone, primary
secondary sexual characteristics. mention because, know think nowadays
marijuana use far widespread certainly puberty can profound
effects hormonal systems. another episode, goes really
deep this. yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity increasing aromatase.
Almost everyone can appreciate drinking pregnancy, not good
developing fetus. Fetal alcohol syndrome well-established negative outcome
pregnancy. something cognitive effects really bad.
actually physical malformation, et cetera. drinking pregnancy, not good.
Probably drinking puberty, not good either. alcohol, particular certain
things like beer grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity. Now, isn't
just protecting young boys estrogenic activity. also protecting girls


excessive even hypo estrogenic effects alcohol puberty. Now, many teenagers
drink. College students drink important point puberty doesn't start
one day end another day, puberty beginning middle end,
development really entire lifespan. idea know, puberty know
open close. just false.

00:56:25 Cell Phone Technology: Effects Hormones, Ovaries, & Testicles

Okay, talked cannabis. talked alcohol. talk cell
phones. First all, use cell phone. use often. not think evil
devices. think require discipline order make sure not
become negative force one's life. personally restrict number hours
phone particular social media. answer email particular
times day. cell phone itself? know, junior
professor. pre-tenure early professor. taught class neural circuits
health disease. one students asked me, know cell phones safe
brain? know, data point fact were. least
no data showing wasn't. still don't answer that, frankly.
don't see lot studies it. not personally aware evidence quality
peer reviewed studies showing cell phones bad brain holding
phone ear bad Bluetooth bad that. just not aware
quality studies. aware quality studies, peer reviewed study please reference
them, put comment section. Send me, however like. love
see them. not aware them. However, interested particular study
published back 2013 rats. basically took cell phone put
cage rats looked basically testicular ovarian development rats
saw minor still statistically significant defects ovarian testicular
development. Since now returning literature, seen absolute
explosion studies. quality journals,
call not blue ribbon journals. Identifying defects testicular ovarian
development mere exposure cell phone emitted waves. just call that, don't
know are. sounds almost crazy, right? Anytime somebody starts
talking EMS things like that, kind worry like, person okay?
look, literature pointing direction chronic exposure gonads


cell phones creating serious issues terms health cellular level
terms output. output testes sperm production.
Swimming speed sperm important feature sperm health. ovaries
estrogenic output. regular cycles are. animals, cycles
little bit different humans. don't menstrual cycle.
estrous cycle, generally around four days. think say based
literature, effects cell phone emitted waves gonadal development.
question is, proximity cell phone gonads? Now, taken
literature observe it. course point captions.
don't like cell phone pocket, well past puberty,
nonetheless effects seen adult animals. effects now
demonstrated humans. just talk couple
effects. paper published journal, "Clinical Biochemistry" S. Gander et al.
Looked hormone profiles people based proximity phone frequency
phone use, stored phone body. Aa well proximity
lived to, guess called radio-frequency towers. base stations.
looking effects radio frequency radiation RFR human hormone
profiles. show significant decreases cortisol. might say, "Well, might
good." need morning cortisol bump order wake up. Morning cortisol
good. also thyroid hormones significantly reduced. Prolactin young
females, definitely concerning testosterone levels males females.
so, now quite good data showing close phone much
day close interesting question living near one base stations
apparently can effects hormone profiles. see study like one
always ask, "Well, things also effects
hormone profiles?" Right? Cause imagine ran study
people live close waterway, close highway lot exhaust
buses cars, might see similar effects. take sorts
studies grain salt. think interesting. given last time
looked data way back junior professor like
one two studies find. One studies pointed increases
testosterone rats, close proximity radio-frequency
radiation waves. case, showed decreases testosterone.
really wasn't conclusion takeaway that. Now, pretty impressive


amount data pointing fact effects things hormones.
don't know information. not going stop using phone but,
light work Tyrone Hayes others looking sperm counts looking
decrease testosterone levels sperm counts fertility last 20, 30
years, perhaps know, not surprising. Although again, cell phones
smartphones really prominent use mostly within last 10 11 years.

01:02:33 Beards & Baldness Patterns Around World, DHT, 5-alpha-reductase

hard explain declines simply basis cell phone use.
interesting effects hormones actually can observe
outside people, tell something not just level hormones, also
underlying genetics. relate beard growth baldness.
fascinating. molecule, hormone dihydrotestosterone, made testosterone,
hormone primarily responsible facial hair, beard growth. well,
molecule, hormone primarily responsible lack hair head, hair loss.
work? Well, DHT circulates body binds DHT receptors
face promote hair growth. binds DHD receptors scalp promote
hair loss. Not incidentally, drugs designed prevent hair loss 5-alpha-
reductase inhibitors. remember 5-alpha-reductase Guevedoces? Well,
people discovered Güevedoces, went lot research
underlying biochemistry really interesting molecule dihydrotestosterone.
identified 5-alpha-reductase. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors basis
anti-hair loss treatments there. interesting things
here. First all, side effect profiles treatments hair loss quite severe
many individuals. Remember DHT primary androgen libido, strengthened
connective tissue repair, aggression. Even aggression course held
check, just sort ambition aggression related dopamine, within
testosterone pathway, less pure testosterone, although pure testosterone
effects. DHT is, least primate species including humans, dominant
androgen sorts effects. look somebody, everyone can
predict whether not going go bald based looking their, always
taught mother's father. mother's father bald, higher
probability going go bald. pattern DHT receptors scalp, will


dictate whether not going go bald everywhere just front
called crown type baldness. density beard tells density
DHT receptors. Now varies background, genetic background. actually
around world nowadays, people travel people form couples
kids many different people different mixed cultures. seeing starting
disappear. areas areas world men seem
pattern baldness, like strip baldness center, hair still
sides full beards. patterns DHT receptors
genetically determined. Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still high, DHT levels
blood can high yet people will light beards no beards.
don't lot DHT receptors face. still
cultures see people huge beard, tons beard. beards growing
way eyes huge heads hair.
lot DHT receptors face not scalp. lot
effects DHT can just see male phenotypes. interesting
hair loss drugs are, prevent hair loss drugs, directly aimed preventing
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone.
extent prevent hair loss, also extent have, bunch side effects
associated low DHT.

01:06:39 Creatine & DHT/Hair Loss

Along lines particular sports supplement lot people use called
Creatine. Creatine, now lot research showing Creatine can bring
water muscle. can support strength. number things.
Might even important cognitive promoting. Cognitive enhancement effects,
although mild. studies show can significant. people, not
anecdotal, report creatine promotes hair loss. differs individual.
people true, others no. yes appear, based studies able
find PubMed, creatine promote 5-alpha-reductase activity therefore
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone. makes sense
might promote degree hair loss, well beard growth, well
effects DHT. recall junior high school middle school, going home one Summer
seventh grade, coming back eighth grade kid knew


friends with, went like young kid to, like grown man, full
beard. amazing. like completely transformed. puberty
said before, without doubt accelerated rate development will
go point lives. Even faster infancy just terms huge
number different cognitive changes physical changes. Not surprisingly
individual mostly bald early twenties. must
just exceedingly high levels DHT. also played soccer kid
basically like dribbling past everybody. like grown man, playing soccer
bunch little kids.

01:08:20 Predicting Aging Rates Pubertal Rates

Full beard know, bald 20. rate maturation, rate aging
interesting. hard know rate aging. genetic tests now can allow
that. Things like Horvath Clocks things sort. Beautiful work David
Sinclair Harvard others pointed this. speed entry exit
puberty might be, putting hypothesis. Might interesting
window, fast one going aging developmental arc.
development course, doesn't just start birth end puberty. continues
entire life. think interesting. will often see people, boys girls.
say boys girls, will develop secondary sexual characteristics different rates.
sometimes sequential. know might see kid will, grow tall
big growth spurt, breast development will come little bit later.
features will come little bit later. can also see boys.
person referred earlier, friend developed full beard, know, went
bald. also quite muscular, great athlete. went puberty
exceedingly fast. people go slowly. people will go
puberty age 14, won't start accumulate facial hair much, much later.
voice will change first, early. won't get secondary
sexual characteristics much later. so, don't really know impacts
relates overall trajectory rate aging. interesting thing think
every one us. going offer opportunity experiment
today,



01:10:04 Hyenas, Baseball, & Hypertrophied Clitorises: Androstenedione

00:49:42 Cannabis, Alcohol: Babies, Puberty & Adults

turns nature far interesting that. Okay,
things impact sexual development early life later life. talk
cannabis. talk alcohol dare say talk cell phones. Something
never thought ever do, either podcast classroom. But,
days really interesting data. think aware them. First
all, cannabis, marijuana, THC. realize now lot different variance
this. lot different strains cannabis. personally not pot smoker.
just not me. not talking moral legal implications, States
decriminalized, places really illegal places basically legal.
check, know live understand laws. not
about. know however, exception one study
many studies point fact THC things cannabis promote
significant increases aromatase activity. Now pot smokers aren't going like this,
especially male pot smokers aren't going like reality. Remember,
hearing background Costello snoring really loud? put
screen? not cannabis smoker, can imagine why. Come Costello.
Come buddy, come here. asleep. Come here. [indistinct],

get back sleep. always here, asked see him. Costello's not
pot smoker either. dog sitter pot smoker years ago.
favorite dog sitter but, not pot smoker. Again, no judgment. deal.
cannabis, not clear THC elements marijuana plant,
promote aromatase activity. Now, observed anecdotally pot
smokers higher incidence developing something mentioned
gynecomastia, breast bud development. full-blown breast development males.
may women want increase estrogenic activity. Remember
females make testosterone. comes adrenals, right? don't testes.
comes adrenals testosterone can also aromatized. Although


typically aromatase activity referring examples
males. testosterone can increase estrogenic activity. might say, "Oh
know, therefore testosterone reduce sexual behavior? create sorts
things related low testosterone?" Not necessarily, not necessarily.
why, estrogen males females important things like libido sexual
behavior. going repeat that. estrogen low males, can actually inhibit
libido sexual behavior. don't want estrogen high low. Whether
not male female. Now course females, estrogen levels tend higher
males. speaking generally here. just think back chromosomal
sex. referring say male female, although nuance
course. females, testosterone comes adrenals
powerful effect libido desire reproduce. next episode, going
talk works relationship birth control, relationship
menopause. also going talk whole thing works males well.
cannabis aspects marijuana plant can impact levels testosterone
estrogen increasing aromatase. people aware that. well,
good data. able find several studies PubMed, pointing fact
smoking marijuana pregnancy can shift pattern hormones
developing fetus, promotes estrogenic outcomes. Now earlier said
estrogen masculinized male brain, utero true, way
cannabis seems work, least studies able identify
promotes circulating estrogen body therefore can counteract
masculinizing effects things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone, primary
secondary sexual characteristics. mention because, know think nowadays
marijuana use far widespread certainly puberty can profound
effects hormonal systems. another episode, goes really
deep this. yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity increasing aromatase.
Almost everyone can appreciate drinking pregnancy, not good
developing fetus. Fetal alcohol syndrome well-established negative outcome
pregnancy. something cognitive effects really bad.
actually physical malformation, et cetera. drinking pregnancy, not good.
Probably drinking puberty, not good either. alcohol, particular certain
things like beer grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity. Now, isn't
just protecting young boys estrogenic activity. also protecting girls


excessive even hypo estrogenic effects alcohol puberty. Now, many teenagers
drink. College students drink important point puberty doesn't start
one day end another day, puberty beginning middle end,
development really entire lifespan. idea know, puberty know
open close. just false.

00:56:25 Cell Phone Technology: Effects Hormones, Ovaries, & Testicles

Okay, talked cannabis. talked alcohol. talk cell
phones. First all, use cell phone. use often. not think evil
devices. think require discipline order make sure not
become negative force one's life. personally restrict number hours
phone particular social media. answer email particular
times day. cell phone itself? know, junior
professor. pre-tenure early professor. taught class neural circuits
health disease. one students asked me, know cell phones safe
brain? know, data point fact were. least
no data showing wasn't. still don't answer that, frankly.
don't see lot studies it. not personally aware evidence quality
peer reviewed studies showing cell phones bad brain holding
phone ear bad Bluetooth bad that. just not aware
quality studies. aware quality studies, peer reviewed study please reference
them, put comment section. Send me, however like. love
see them. not aware them. However, interested particular study
published back 2013 rats. basically took cell phone put
cage rats looked basically testicular ovarian development rats
saw minor still statistically significant defects ovarian testicular
development. Since now returning literature, seen absolute
explosion studies. quality journals,
call not blue ribbon journals. Identifying defects testicular ovarian
development mere exposure cell phone emitted waves. just call that, don't
know are. sounds almost crazy, right? Anytime somebody starts
talking EMS things like that, kind worry like, person okay?
look, literature pointing direction chronic exposure gonads


cell phones creating serious issues terms health cellular level
terms output. output testes sperm production.
Swimming speed sperm important feature sperm health. ovaries
estrogenic output. regular cycles are. animals, cycles
little bit different humans. don't menstrual cycle.
estrous cycle, generally around four days. think say based
literature, effects cell phone emitted waves gonadal development.
question is, proximity cell phone gonads? Now, taken
literature observe it. course point captions.
don't like cell phone pocket, well past puberty,
nonetheless effects seen adult animals. effects now
demonstrated humans. just talk couple
effects. paper published journal, "Clinical Biochemistry" S. Gander et al.
Looked hormone profiles people based proximity phone frequency
phone use, stored phone body. Aa well proximity
lived to, guess called radio-frequency towers. base stations.
looking effects radio frequency radiation RFR human hormone
profiles. show significant decreases cortisol. might say, "Well, might
good." need morning cortisol bump order wake up. Morning cortisol
good. also thyroid hormones significantly reduced. Prolactin young
females, definitely concerning testosterone levels males females.
so, now quite good data showing close phone much
day close interesting question living near one base stations
apparently can effects hormone profiles. see study like one
always ask, "Well, things also effects
hormone profiles?" Right? Cause imagine ran study
people live close waterway, close highway lot exhaust
buses cars, might see similar effects. take sorts
studies grain salt. think interesting. given last time
looked data way back junior professor like
one two studies find. One studies pointed increases
testosterone rats, close proximity radio-frequency
radiation waves. case, showed decreases testosterone.
really wasn't conclusion takeaway that. Now, pretty impressive


amount data pointing fact effects things hormones.
don't know information. not going stop using phone but,
light work Tyrone Hayes others looking sperm counts looking
decrease testosterone levels sperm counts fertility last 20, 30
years, perhaps know, not surprising. Although again, cell phones
smartphones really prominent use mostly within last 10 11 years.

01:02:33 Beards & Baldness Patterns Around World, DHT, 5-alpha-reductase

hard explain declines simply basis cell phone use.
interesting effects hormones actually can observe
outside people, tell something not just level hormones, also
underlying genetics. relate beard growth baldness.
fascinating. molecule, hormone dihydrotestosterone, made testosterone,
hormone primarily responsible facial hair, beard growth. well,
molecule, hormone primarily responsible lack hair head, hair loss.
work? Well, DHT circulates body binds DHT receptors
face promote hair growth. binds DHD receptors scalp promote
hair loss. Not incidentally, drugs designed prevent hair loss 5-alpha-
reductase inhibitors. remember 5-alpha-reductase Guevedoces? Well,
people discovered Güevedoces, went lot research
underlying biochemistry really interesting molecule dihydrotestosterone.
identified 5-alpha-reductase. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors basis
anti-hair loss treatments there. interesting things
here. First all, side effect profiles treatments hair loss quite severe
many individuals. Remember DHT primary androgen libido, strengthened
connective tissue repair, aggression. Even aggression course held
check, just sort ambition aggression related dopamine, within
testosterone pathway, less pure testosterone, although pure testosterone
effects. DHT is, least primate species including humans, dominant
androgen sorts effects. look somebody, everyone can
predict whether not going go bald based looking their, always
taught mother's father. mother's father bald, higher
probability going go bald. pattern DHT receptors scalp, will


dictate whether not going go bald everywhere just front
called crown type baldness. density beard tells density
DHT receptors. Now varies background, genetic background. actually
around world nowadays, people travel people form couples
kids many different people different mixed cultures. seeing starting
disappear. areas areas world men seem
pattern baldness, like strip baldness center, hair still
sides full beards. patterns DHT receptors
genetically determined. Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still high, DHT levels
blood can high yet people will light beards no beards.
don't lot DHT receptors face. still
cultures see people huge beard, tons beard. beards growing
way eyes huge heads hair.
lot DHT receptors face not scalp. lot
effects DHT can just see male phenotypes. interesting
hair loss drugs are, prevent hair loss drugs, directly aimed preventing
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone.
extent prevent hair loss, also extent have, bunch side effects
associated low DHT.

01:06:39 Creatine & DHT/Hair Loss

Along lines particular sports supplement lot people use called
Creatine. Creatine, now lot research showing Creatine can bring
water muscle. can support strength. number things.
Might even important cognitive promoting. Cognitive enhancement effects,
although mild. studies show can significant. people, not
anecdotal, report creatine promotes hair loss. differs individual.
people true, others no. yes appear, based studies able
find PubMed, creatine promote 5-alpha-reductase activity therefore
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone. makes sense
might promote degree hair loss, well beard growth, well
effects DHT. recall junior high school middle school, going home one Summer
seventh grade, coming back eighth grade kid knew


friends with, went like young kid to, like grown man, full
beard. amazing. like completely transformed. puberty
said before, without doubt accelerated rate development will
go point lives. Even faster infancy just terms huge
number different cognitive changes physical changes. Not surprisingly
individual mostly bald early twenties. must
just exceedingly high levels DHT. also played soccer kid
basically like dribbling past everybody. like grown man, playing soccer
bunch little kids.

01:08:20 Predicting Aging Rates Pubertal Rates

Full beard know, bald 20. rate maturation, rate aging
interesting. hard know rate aging. genetic tests now can allow
that. Things like Horvath Clocks things sort. Beautiful work David
Sinclair Harvard others pointed this. speed entry exit
puberty might be, putting hypothesis. Might interesting
window, fast one going aging developmental arc.
development course, doesn't just start birth end puberty. continues
entire life. think interesting. will often see people, boys girls.
say boys girls, will develop secondary sexual characteristics different rates.
sometimes sequential. know might see kid will, grow tall
big growth spurt, breast development will come little bit later.
features will come little bit later. can also see boys.
person referred earlier, friend developed full beard, know, went
bald. also quite muscular, great athlete. went puberty
exceedingly fast. people go slowly. people will go
puberty age 14, won't start accumulate facial hair much, much later.
voice will change first, early. won't get secondary
sexual characteristics much later. so, don't really know impacts
relates overall trajectory rate aging. interesting thing think
every one us. going offer opportunity experiment
today,

another,

00:49:42 Cannabis, Alcohol: Babies, Puberty & Adults

turns nature far interesting that. Okay,
things impact sexual development early life later life. talk
cannabis. talk alcohol dare say talk cell phones. Something
never thought ever do, either podcast classroom. But,
days really interesting data. think aware them. First
all, cannabis, marijuana, THC. realize now lot different variance
this. lot different strains cannabis. personally not pot smoker.
just not me. not talking moral legal implications, States
decriminalized, places really illegal places basically legal.
check, know live understand laws. not
about. know however, exception one study
many studies point fact THC things cannabis promote
significant increases aromatase activity. Now pot smokers aren't going like this,
especially male pot smokers aren't going like reality. Remember,
hearing background Costello snoring really loud? put
screen? not cannabis smoker, can imagine why. Come Costello.
Come buddy, come here. asleep. Come here. [indistinct],
go. dog definitely not need cannabis. state time.
highly... Oh asleep still. asked see Costello just
listening audio, maybe gives [Costello grunts] Oh, okay. going let
get back sleep. always here, asked see him. Costello's not
pot smoker either. dog sitter pot smoker years ago.
favorite dog sitter but, not pot smoker. Again, no judgment. deal.
cannabis, not clear THC elements marijuana plant,
promote aromatase activity. Now, observed anecdotally pot
smokers higher incidence developing something mentioned
gynecomastia, breast bud development. full-blown breast development males.
may women want increase estrogenic activity. Remember
females make testosterone. comes adrenals, right? don't testes.
comes adrenals testosterone can also aromatized. Although


typically aromatase activity referring examples
males. testosterone can increase estrogenic activity. might say, "Oh
know, therefore testosterone reduce sexual behavior? create sorts
things related low testosterone?" Not necessarily, not necessarily.
why, estrogen males females important things like libido sexual
behavior. going repeat that. estrogen low males, can actually inhibit
libido sexual behavior. don't want estrogen high low. Whether
not male female. Now course females, estrogen levels tend higher
males. speaking generally here. just think back chromosomal
sex. referring say male female, although nuance
course. females, testosterone comes adrenals
powerful effect libido desire reproduce. next episode, going
talk works relationship birth control, relationship
menopause. also going talk whole thing works males well.
cannabis aspects marijuana plant can impact levels testosterone
estrogen increasing aromatase. people aware that. well,
good data. able find several studies PubMed, pointing fact
smoking marijuana pregnancy can shift pattern hormones
developing fetus, promotes estrogenic outcomes. Now earlier said
estrogen masculinized male brain, utero true, way
cannabis seems work, least studies able identify
promotes circulating estrogen body therefore can counteract
masculinizing effects things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone, primary
secondary sexual characteristics. mention because, know think nowadays
marijuana use far widespread certainly puberty can profound
effects hormonal systems. another episode, goes really
deep this. yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity increasing aromatase.
Almost everyone can appreciate drinking pregnancy, not good
developing fetus. Fetal alcohol syndrome well-established negative outcome
pregnancy. something cognitive effects really bad.
actually physical malformation, et cetera. drinking pregnancy, not good.
Probably drinking puberty, not good either. alcohol, particular certain
things like beer grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity. Now, isn't
just protecting young boys estrogenic activity. also protecting girls


excessive even hypo estrogenic effects alcohol puberty. Now, many teenagers
drink. College students drink important point puberty doesn't start
one day end another day, puberty beginning middle end,
development really entire lifespan. idea know, puberty know
open close. just false.

00:56:25 Cell Phone Technology: Effects Hormones, Ovaries, & Testicles

Okay, talked cannabis. talked alcohol. talk cell
phones. First all, use cell phone. use often. not think evil
devices. think require discipline order make sure not
become negative force one's life. personally restrict number hours

times day. cell phone itself? know, junior
professor. pre-tenure early professor. taught class neural circuits

no data showing wasn't. still don't answer that, frankly.
don't see lot studies it. not personally aware evidence quality
peer reviewed studies showing cell phones bad brain holding
phone ear bad Bluetooth bad that. just not aware
quality studies. aware quality studies, peer reviewed study please reference
them, put comment section. Send me, however like. love
see them. not aware them. However, interested particular study
published back 2013 rats. basically took cell phone put
cage rats looked basically testicular ovarian development rats
saw minor still statistically significant defects ovarian testicular
development. Since now returning literature, seen absolute
explosion studies. quality journals,
call not blue ribbon journals. Identifying defects testicular ovarian
development mere exposure cell phone emitted waves. just call that, don't
know are. sounds almost crazy, right? Anytime somebody starts
talking EMS things like that, kind worry like, person okay?
look, literature pointing direction chronic exposure gonads


cell phones creating serious issues terms health cellular level
terms output. output testes sperm production.
Swimming speed sperm important feature sperm health. ovaries
estrogenic output. regular cycles are. animals, cycles
little bit different humans. don't menstrual cycle.
estrous cycle, generally around four days. think say based
literature, effects cell phone emitted waves gonadal development.
question is, proximity cell phone gonads? Now, taken
literature observe it. course point captions.
don't like cell phone pocket, well past puberty,
nonetheless effects seen adult animals. effects now

good. also thyroid hormones significantly reduced. Prolactin young
females, definitely concerning testosterone levels males females.
so, now quite good data showing close phone much
day close interesting question living near one base stations
apparently can effects hormone profiles. see study like one
always ask, "Well, things also effects
hormone profiles?" Right? Cause imagine ran study
people live close waterway, close highway lot exhaust
buses cars, might see similar effects. take sorts
studies grain salt. think interesting. given last time
looked data way back junior professor like
one two studies find. One studies pointed increases
testosterone rats, close proximity radio-frequency
radiation waves. case, showed decreases testosterone.
really wasn't conclusion takeaway that. Now, pretty impressive


amount data pointing fact effects things hormones.
don't know information. not going stop using phone but,
light work Tyrone Hayes others looking sperm counts looking
decrease testosterone levels sperm counts fertility last 20, 30
years, perhaps know, not surprising. Although again, cell phones
smartphones really prominent use mostly within last 10 11 years.

01:02:33 Beards & Baldness Patterns Around World, DHT, 5-alpha-reductase

hard explain declines simply basis cell phone use.
interesting effects hormones actually can observe
outside people, tell something not just level hormones, also
underlying genetics. relate beard growth baldness.
fascinating. molecule, hormone dihydrotestosterone, made testosterone,
hormone primarily responsible facial hair, beard growth. well,
molecule, hormone primarily responsible lack hair head, hair loss.
work? Well, DHT circulates body binds DHT receptors
face promote hair growth. binds DHD receptors scalp promote
hair loss. Not incidentally, drugs designed prevent hair loss 5-alpha-
reductase inhibitors. remember 5-alpha-reductase Guevedoces? Well,
people discovered Güevedoces, went lot research
underlying biochemistry really interesting molecule dihydrotestosterone.
identified 5-alpha-reductase. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors basis
anti-hair loss treatments there. interesting things
here. First all, side effect profiles treatments hair loss quite severe
many individuals. Remember DHT primary androgen libido, strengthened
connective tissue repair, aggression. Even aggression course held
check, just sort ambition aggression related dopamine, within
testosterone pathway, less pure testosterone, although pure testosterone
effects. DHT is, least primate species including humans, dominant
androgen sorts effects. look somebody, everyone can
predict whether not going go bald based looking their, always
taught mother's father. mother's father bald, higher
probability going go bald. pattern DHT receptors scalp, will


dictate whether not going go bald everywhere just front
called crown type baldness. density beard tells density
DHT receptors. Now varies background, genetic background. actually
around world nowadays, people travel people form couples
kids many different people different mixed cultures. seeing starting
disappear. areas areas world men seem
pattern baldness, like strip baldness center, hair still
sides full beards. patterns DHT receptors
genetically determined. Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still high, DHT levels
blood can high yet people will light beards no beards.
don't lot DHT receptors face. still
cultures see people huge beard, tons beard. beards growing
way eyes huge heads hair.
lot DHT receptors face not scalp. lot
effects DHT can just see male phenotypes. interesting
hair loss drugs are, prevent hair loss drugs, directly aimed preventing
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone.
extent prevent hair loss, also extent have, bunch side effects
associated low DHT.

01:06:39 Creatine & DHT/Hair Loss

Along lines particular sports supplement lot people use called
Creatine. Creatine, now lot research showing Creatine can bring
water muscle. can support strength. number things.
Might even important cognitive promoting. Cognitive enhancement effects,
although mild. studies show can significant. people, not
anecdotal, report creatine promotes hair loss. differs individual.
people true, others no. yes appear, based studies able
find PubMed, creatine promote 5-alpha-reductase activity therefore
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone. makes sense
might promote degree hair loss, well beard growth, well
effects DHT. recall junior high school middle school, going home one Summer
seventh grade, coming back eighth grade kid knew


friends with, went like young kid to, like grown man, full
beard. amazing. like completely transformed. puberty
said before, without doubt accelerated rate development will
go point lives. Even faster infancy just terms huge
number different cognitive changes physical changes. Not surprisingly
individual mostly bald early twenties. must
just exceedingly high levels DHT. also played soccer kid
basically like dribbling past everybody. like grown man, playing soccer
bunch little kids.

01:08:20 Predicting Aging Rates Pubertal Rates

Full beard know, bald 20. rate maturation, rate aging
interesting. hard know rate aging. genetic tests now can allow
that. Things like Horvath Clocks things sort. Beautiful work David
Sinclair Harvard others pointed this. speed entry exit
puberty might be, putting hypothesis. Might interesting
window, fast one going aging developmental arc.
development course, doesn't just start birth end puberty. continues
entire life. think interesting. will often see people, boys girls.
say boys girls, will develop secondary sexual characteristics different rates.
sometimes sequential. know might see kid will, grow tall
big growth spurt, breast development will come little bit later.
features will come little bit later. can also see boys.
person referred earlier, friend developed full beard, know, went
bald. also quite muscular, great athlete. went puberty
exceedingly fast. people go slowly. people will go
puberty age 14, won't start accumulate facial hair much, much later.
voice will change first, early. won't get secondary
sexual characteristics much later. so, don't really know impacts

01:10:04 Hyenas, Baseball, & Hypertrophied Clitorises: Androstenedione

listening podcast. first want tell story hyenas,
professional baseball clitoris's size penises. graduate
student UC Berkeley, professor department, phenomenal scientist

body, hormones social structure. Hyenas, unlike many species,
situation genitalia male penis actually smaller female
clitoris. say male penis itself, seen fair number hyena
penises, not particularly small. means hyena clitoris's extremely
large. well known time. turns spotted hyenas
females dominant. kill females will eat, young will eat.
male hyenas will eat. well, female hyena gives birth, gives
birth, not vaginal canal accustomed seeing,
enlarged clitoris's like phallus. Although not phallus, clitoris. literally
splits open. many fetuses die course hyena development birth.
animals this, described large giant clitoris.
Although hyena not giant, normal. splits open baby actually
comes through. baby hyena actually comes tissue

exposure androgens particular utero, impacted whether
not people report homosexual, heterosexual, identify male female.
familiar work graduate student department first
published work author paper. not main driver
work, involved work. certainly know people work.
First starts story. researcher still going now. name
Dennis McFadden. believe UT Austin back then. studying
auditory system. people come clinic would, laboratory.
look hearing explore different aspects call
psychophysics hearing understanding hearing thresholds frequency
thresholds. made several observations. observations young
males tended called auto acoustic emissions, often young
females did. Auto acoustic emissions, name suggests, ears actually
making sounds. Now sounds picked special apparatus,
can hear frequency. turns ears don't just take


sound waves convert thing call hearing. also
cases make sound. ears making sounds. Strange right? turns
sex difference auto acoustic emissions. turns also people self-
report lesbians, also auto acoustic emissions significantly
females don't self-report lesbian. Dennis noticed published this.
important discovery one first discoveries pointed
fact sex differences biology independent sex. mean,
hearing auto acoustic emissions. just really illustrate that.
former problem study important? know, lot people
explored instance whether not, homosexuals lower testosterone instance
males. actually result often opposite. gay men men self-
report gay, often much higher testosterone. studies became
controversial people said, "Well, sexual behavior can relate testosterone," et
cetera. became controversial. studies
attempted look equivalent phenomenon people self report lesbian.
self-report heterosexual. became complicated.
identification phenomenon, auto acoustic emissions, independent

teaching point. soon after, study Mark directed exploring
finger length ratios. explain are. males females,
people self-reported homosexual heterosexual. just get basic,
call sex differences first. averages. want point out. Anytime

effect particularly, excuse me, pronounced right hand. Although not
always, okay? not handedness. D2 D4 difference
measured correctly. can't just look somebody hands say, "Oh,
ring finger index finger similar. therefore female

somebody see index finger much shorter ring finger say,
"Oh, must've exposed lot androgen." actually measure

episode hormones impact behavior behavior also impact hormones.
case hormones impacting really considered primary sexual

actually established utero. people self-reported lesbians. remember
going collecting data with, collaborators work. Again,
wasn't main driver work. participated analysis. People
self-report lesbians also tend smaller D2 D4 ratio.
consistent auto acoustic emission study Dennis McFadden published.
points fact early exposure androgens may impact, not just
androgenization body plan, also separately sexual preference. Now,
raises sorts interesting questions biological basis sexual preference.

01:29:13 Brain Dimorphisms Sexual Orientation

tell another study. guy named Simon LeVay UCLA.
trained Hubel Wiesel. remember early episodes "Plasticy,"
David Hubel Torsten Wiesel scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovery critical periods brain plasticity. defined
important aspects see brain plasticity. Simon LeVay trained them.
Simon went discover brains people self-report
homosexual brain difference. brain difference area called
Interstitial Nucleus Anterior Hypothalamus. INAH.
published reports. published Science. work refer published
Nature, replicated no fewer six times. McFadden results
point strong biological correlates mate choice, sexual preference. tie
directly things like androgenization estrogenization. Meaning call
maleness femaleness, sort tricky territory. way
described huge range sex can defined earlier. So, want
measure D2 D4 ratio welcome to, also understand
not predictive anything, right? just window possible androgen exposure
early life. plenty men report
heterosexual similar D2 D4 ratios females.
plenty females whose index fingers shorter ring fingers.
perfectly happy say perfectly happy. inclined
believe heterosexual. variation. fact, Mark tells really good
joke. want know whether not somebody homosexual heterosexual,
simply look hands, look D2 D4 ratio guess heterosexual.


right 96% time. 96% time people report
heterosexual average. numbers might changing. joke really joke
science because, falls within realm statistical significance. yet really
illustrates fact none causal. nonetheless interesting
means hormones organizing brain early development ways
can potentially impact opposite sex partner choice later life. Now
course, things can impact opposite sex same-sex partner choice
later life. study not look people reported bisexual.

01:32:00 “Older Brother Effects”: Male Fetuses Might Change Mothers & Subsequent

hasn't lot studies yet. One thing interesting,
good scientific data also controversy that, appears
probability male human self-reporting homosexual, increases
number older brothers has. Now, doesn't mean older
brother even 10 older brothers, sure self-report
homosexual. statistically becomes likely somebody will
successive older brother have. idea starting emerge,
developmental neuroendocrinology landscape record within mother
many male fetuses carried, male fetuses secreting certain
things, dihydrotestosterone, things, can feed back genome.
epigenomic effects onto placenta itself, higher
probability subsequent pregnancies offspring will self-report homosexual.
fascinating area biology. noticed today, none deals
current controversies around gender many genders sex, et cetera
separate conversation definition grounded kind concepts
talking today needs take place, taking consideration aspects
sex effects hormones, body, brain. didn't talk lot
spinal cord, will next episode. can just say brain

01:35:06 Path Forward & Warning

Next episode, going talking science sex, verb, actual
reproduction. also going talking effects hormones various
aspects behavior ways modulate hormones, use behavior,
supplementation. Also touch diet nutrition bit. going talk
interactions things behavior, relate important
themes like sex reproduction. Like workplace performance. Like motivation

typically aromatase activity referring examples
males. testosterone can increase estrogenic activity. might say, "Oh
know, therefore testosterone reduce sexual behavior? create sorts
things related low testosterone?" Not necessarily, not necessarily.
why, estrogen males females important things like libido sexual
behavior. going repeat that. estrogen low males, can actually inhibit
libido sexual behavior. don't want estrogen high low. Whether
not male female. Now course females, estrogen levels tend higher
males. speaking generally here. just think back chromosomal
sex. referring say male female, although nuance
course. females, testosterone comes adrenals
powerful effect libido desire reproduce. next episode, going
talk works relationship birth control, relationship
menopause. also going talk whole thing works males well.
cannabis aspects marijuana plant can impact levels testosterone
estrogen increasing aromatase. people aware that. well,
good data. able find several studies PubMed, pointing fact
smoking marijuana pregnancy can shift pattern hormones
developing fetus, promotes estrogenic outcomes. Now earlier said
estrogen masculinized male brain, utero true, way
cannabis seems work, least studies able identify
promotes circulating estrogen body therefore can counteract
masculinizing effects things like testosterone dihydrotestosterone, primary
secondary sexual characteristics. mention because, know think nowadays
marijuana use far widespread certainly puberty can profound
effects hormonal systems. another episode, goes really
deep this. yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity increasing aromatase.
Almost everyone can appreciate drinking pregnancy, not good
developing fetus. Fetal alcohol syndrome well-established negative outcome
pregnancy. something cognitive effects really bad.
actually physical malformation, et cetera. drinking pregnancy, not good.
Probably drinking puberty, not good either. alcohol, particular certain
things like beer grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity. Now, isn't
just protecting young boys estrogenic activity. also protecting girls


excessive even hypo estrogenic effects alcohol puberty. Now, many teenagers
drink. College students drink important point puberty doesn't start
one day end another day, puberty beginning middle end,
development really entire lifespan. idea know, puberty know
open close. just false.

00:56:25 Cell Phone Technology: Effects Hormones, Ovaries, & Testicles

Okay, talked cannabis. talked alcohol. talk cell
phones. First all, use cell phone. use often. not think evil
devices. think require discipline order make sure not
become negative force one's life. personally restrict number hours
phone particular social media. answer email particular
times day. cell phone itself? know, junior
professor. pre-tenure early professor. taught class neural circuits
health disease. one students asked me, know cell phones safe
brain? know, data point fact were. least
no data showing wasn't. still don't answer that, frankly.
don't see lot studies it. not personally aware evidence quality
peer reviewed studies showing cell phones bad brain holding
phone ear bad Bluetooth bad that. just not aware
quality studies. aware quality studies, peer reviewed study please reference
them, put comment section. Send me, however like. love
see them. not aware them. However, interested particular study
published back 2013 rats. basically took cell phone put
cage rats looked basically testicular ovarian development rats
saw minor still statistically significant defects ovarian testicular
development. Since now returning literature, seen absolute
explosion studies. quality journals,
call not blue ribbon journals. Identifying defects testicular ovarian
development mere exposure cell phone emitted waves. just call that, don't
know are. sounds almost crazy, right? Anytime somebody starts
talking EMS things like that, kind worry like, person okay?
look, literature pointing direction chronic exposure gonads


cell phones creating serious issues terms health cellular level
terms output. output testes sperm production.
Swimming speed sperm important feature sperm health. ovaries
estrogenic output. regular cycles are. animals, cycles
little bit different humans. don't menstrual cycle.
estrous cycle, generally around four days. think say based
literature, effects cell phone emitted waves gonadal development.
question is, proximity cell phone gonads? Now, taken
literature observe it. course point captions.
don't like cell phone pocket, well past puberty,
nonetheless effects seen adult animals. effects now
demonstrated humans. just talk couple
effects. paper published journal, "Clinical Biochemistry" S. Gander et al.
Looked hormone profiles people based proximity phone frequency
phone use, stored phone body. Aa well proximity
lived to, guess called radio-frequency towers. base stations.
looking effects radio frequency radiation RFR human hormone
profiles. show significant decreases cortisol. might say, "Well, might
good." need morning cortisol bump order wake up. Morning cortisol
good. also thyroid hormones significantly reduced. Prolactin young
females, definitely concerning testosterone levels males females.
so, now quite good data showing close phone much
day close interesting question living near one base stations
apparently can effects hormone profiles. see study like one
always ask, "Well, things also effects

00:56:25 Cell Phone Technology: Effects Hormones, Ovaries, & Testicles

Okay, talked cannabis. talked alcohol. talk cell
phones. First all, use cell phone. use often. not think evil
devices. think require discipline order make sure not
become negative force one's life. personally restrict number hours
phone particular social media. answer email particular
times day. cell phone itself? know, junior
professor. pre-tenure early professor. taught class neural circuits
health disease. one students asked me, know cell phones safe
brain? know, data point fact were. least
no data showing wasn't. still don't answer that, frankly.
don't see lot studies it. not personally aware evidence quality
peer reviewed studies showing cell phones bad brain holding
phone ear bad Bluetooth bad that. just not aware
quality studies. aware quality studies, peer reviewed study please reference
them, put comment section. Send me, however like. love
see them. not aware them. However, interested particular study
published back 2013 rats. basically took cell phone put
cage rats looked basically testicular ovarian development rats
saw minor still statistically significant defects ovarian testicular
development. Since now returning literature, seen absolute
explosion studies. quality journals,
call not blue ribbon journals. Identifying defects testicular ovarian
development mere exposure cell phone emitted waves. just call that, don't
know are. sounds almost crazy, right? Anytime somebody starts
talking EMS things like that, kind worry like, person okay?
look, literature pointing direction chronic exposure gonads


cell phones creating serious issues terms health cellular level
terms output. output testes sperm production.
Swimming speed sperm important feature sperm health. ovaries
estrogenic output. regular cycles are. animals, cycles
little bit different humans. don't menstrual cycle.
estrous cycle, generally around four days. think say based
literature, effects cell phone emitted waves gonadal development.
question is, proximity cell phone gonads? Now, taken
literature observe it. course point captions.
don't like cell phone pocket, well past puberty,
nonetheless effects seen adult animals. effects now
demonstrated humans. just talk couple
effects. paper published journal, "Clinical Biochemistry" S. Gander et al.
Looked hormone profiles people based proximity phone frequency
phone use, stored phone body. Aa well proximity
lived to, guess called radio-frequency towers. base stations.
looking effects radio frequency radiation RFR human hormone
profiles. show significant decreases cortisol. might say, "Well, might
good." need morning cortisol bump order wake up. Morning cortisol
good. also thyroid hormones significantly reduced. Prolactin young
females, definitely concerning testosterone levels males females.
so, now quite good data showing close phone much
day close interesting question living near one base stations
apparently can effects hormone profiles. see study like one
always ask, "Well, things also effects
hormone profiles?" Right? Cause imagine ran study
people live close waterway, close highway lot exhaust
buses cars, might see similar effects. take sorts
studies grain salt. think interesting. given last time
looked data way back junior professor like
one two studies find. One studies pointed increases
testosterone rats, close proximity radio-frequency
radiation waves. case, showed decreases testosterone.
really wasn't conclusion takeaway that. Now, pretty impressive


amount data pointing fact effects things hormones.
don't know information. not going stop using phone but,
light work Tyrone Hayes others looking sperm counts looking
decrease testosterone levels sperm counts fertility last 20, 30
years, perhaps know, not surprising. Although again, cell phones
smartphones really prominent use mostly within last 10 11 years.

01:02:33 Beards & Baldness Patterns Around World, DHT, 5-alpha-reductase

hard explain declines simply basis cell phone use.
interesting effects hormones actually can observe
outside people, tell something not just level hormones, also
underlying genetics. relate beard growth baldness.
fascinating. molecule, hormone dihydrotestosterone, made testosterone,
hormone primarily responsible facial hair, beard growth. well,
molecule, hormone primarily responsible lack hair head, hair loss.
work? Well, DHT circulates body binds DHT receptors
face promote hair growth. binds DHD receptors scalp promote
hair loss. Not incidentally, drugs designed prevent hair loss 5-alpha-
reductase inhibitors. remember 5-alpha-reductase Guevedoces? Well,
people discovered Güevedoces, went lot research
underlying biochemistry really interesting molecule dihydrotestosterone.
identified 5-alpha-reductase. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors basis
anti-hair loss treatments there. interesting things
here. First all, side effect profiles treatments hair loss quite severe
many individuals. Remember DHT primary androgen libido, strengthened
connective tissue repair, aggression. Even aggression course held
check, just sort ambition aggression related dopamine, within
testosterone pathway, less pure testosterone, although pure testosterone
effects. DHT is, least primate species including humans, dominant
androgen sorts effects. look somebody, everyone can
predict whether not going go bald based looking their, always
taught mother's father. mother's father bald, higher
probability going go bald. pattern DHT receptors scalp, will


dictate whether not going go bald everywhere just front
called crown type baldness. density beard tells density
DHT receptors. Now varies background, genetic background. actually
around world nowadays, people travel people form couples
kids many different people different mixed cultures. seeing starting
disappear. areas areas world men seem
pattern baldness, like strip baldness center, hair still
sides full beards. patterns DHT receptors
genetically determined. Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still high, DHT levels
blood can high yet people will light beards no beards.
don't lot DHT receptors face. still
cultures see people huge beard, tons beard. beards growing
way eyes huge heads hair.
lot DHT receptors face not scalp. lot
effects DHT can just see male phenotypes. interesting
hair loss drugs are, prevent hair loss drugs, directly aimed preventing
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone.
extent prevent hair loss, also extent have, bunch side effects
associated low DHT.

01:06:39 Creatine & DHT/Hair Loss

Along lines particular sports supplement lot people use called
Creatine. Creatine, now lot research showing Creatine can bring
water muscle. can support strength. number things.
Might even important cognitive promoting. Cognitive enhancement effects,
although mild. studies show can significant. people, not
anecdotal, report creatine promotes hair loss. differs individual.
people true, others no. yes appear, based studies able
find PubMed, creatine promote 5-alpha-reductase activity therefore
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone. makes sense
might promote degree hair loss, well beard growth, well
effects DHT. recall junior high school middle school, going home one Summer
seventh grade, coming back eighth grade kid knew


friends with, went like young kid to, like grown man, full
beard. amazing. like completely transformed. puberty
said before, without doubt accelerated rate development will
go point lives. Even faster infancy just terms huge
number different cognitive changes physical changes. Not surprisingly
individual mostly bald early twenties. must
just exceedingly high levels DHT. also played soccer kid
basically like dribbling past everybody. like grown man, playing soccer
bunch little kids.

01:08:20 Predicting Aging Rates Pubertal Rates

Full beard know, bald 20. rate maturation, rate aging
interesting. hard know rate aging. genetic tests now can allow
that. Things like Horvath Clocks things sort. Beautiful work David
Sinclair Harvard others pointed this. speed entry exit
puberty might be, putting hypothesis. Might interesting
window, fast one going aging developmental arc.
development course, doesn't just start birth end puberty. continues
entire life. think interesting. will often see people, boys girls.
say boys girls, will develop secondary sexual characteristics different rates.
sometimes sequential. know might see kid will, grow tall
big growth spurt, breast development will come little bit later.
features will come little bit later. can also see boys.
person referred earlier, friend developed full beard, know, went
bald. also quite muscular, great athlete. went puberty
exceedingly fast. people go slowly. people will go
puberty age 14, won't start accumulate facial hair much, much later.
voice will change first, early. won't get secondary
sexual characteristics much later. so, don't really know impacts
relates overall trajectory rate aging. interesting thing think
every one us. going offer opportunity experiment
today,

cell phones creating serious issues terms health cellular level
terms output. output testes sperm production.
Swimming speed sperm important feature sperm health. ovaries
estrogenic output. regular cycles are. animals, cycles
little bit different humans. don't menstrual cycle.
estrous cycle, generally around four days. think say based
literature, effects cell phone emitted waves gonadal development.
question is, proximity cell phone gonads? Now, taken
literature observe it. course point captions.
don't like cell phone pocket, well past puberty,
nonetheless effects seen adult animals. effects now
demonstrated humans. just talk couple
effects. paper published journal, "Clinical Biochemistry" S. Gander et al.
Looked hormone profiles people based proximity phone frequency
phone use, stored phone body. Aa well proximity
lived to, guess called radio-frequency towers. base stations.
looking effects radio frequency radiation RFR human hormone
profiles. show significant decreases cortisol. might say, "Well, might
good." need morning cortisol bump order wake up. Morning cortisol
good. also thyroid hormones significantly reduced. Prolactin young
females, definitely concerning testosterone levels males females.
so, now quite good data showing close phone much
day close interesting question living near one base stations
apparently can effects hormone profiles. see study like one
always ask, "Well, things also effects
hormone profiles?" Right? Cause imagine ran study
people live close waterway, close highway lot exhaust
buses cars, might see similar effects. take sorts
studies grain salt. think interesting. given last time
looked data way back junior professor like
one two studies find. One studies pointed increases
testosterone rats, close proximity radio-frequency
radiation waves. case, showed decreases testosterone.
really wasn't conclusion takeaway that. Now, pretty impressive


amount data pointing fact effects things hormones.
don't know information. not going stop using phone but,
light work Tyrone Hayes others looking sperm counts looking
decrease testosterone levels sperm counts fertility last 20, 30
years, perhaps know, not surprising. Although again, cell phones
smartphones really prominent use mostly within last 10 11 years.

01:02:33 Beards & Baldness Patterns Around World, DHT, 5-alpha-reductase

hard explain declines simply basis cell phone use.
interesting effects hormones actually can observe
outside people, tell something not just level hormones, also
underlying genetics. relate beard growth baldness.
fascinating. molecule, hormone dihydrotestosterone, made testosterone,
hormone primarily responsible facial hair, beard growth. well,
molecule, hormone primarily responsible lack hair head, hair loss.
work? Well, DHT circulates body binds DHT receptors
face promote hair growth. binds DHD receptors scalp promote
hair loss. Not incidentally, drugs designed prevent hair loss 5-alpha-
reductase inhibitors. remember 5-alpha-reductase Guevedoces? Well,
people discovered Güevedoces, went lot research
underlying biochemistry really interesting molecule dihydrotestosterone.
identified 5-alpha-reductase. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors basis
anti-hair loss treatments there. interesting things
here. First all, side effect profiles treatments hair loss quite severe
many individuals. Remember DHT primary androgen libido, strengthened
connective tissue repair, aggression. Even aggression course held
check, just sort ambition aggression related dopamine, within
testosterone pathway, less pure testosterone, although pure testosterone
effects. DHT is, least primate species including humans, dominant
androgen sorts effects. look somebody, everyone can
predict whether not going go bald based looking their, always
taught mother's father. mother's father bald, higher
probability going go bald. pattern DHT receptors scalp, will


dictate whether not going go bald everywhere just front
called crown type baldness. density beard tells density
DHT receptors. Now varies background, genetic background. actually
around world nowadays, people travel people form couples
kids many different people different mixed cultures. seeing starting
disappear. areas areas world men seem
pattern baldness, like strip baldness center, hair still
sides full beards. patterns DHT receptors
genetically determined. Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still high, DHT levels
blood can high yet people will light beards no beards.
don't lot DHT receptors face. still
cultures see people huge beard, tons beard. beards growing
way eyes huge heads hair.
lot DHT receptors face not scalp. lot
effects DHT can just see male phenotypes. interesting
hair loss drugs are, prevent hair loss drugs, directly aimed preventing
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone.
extent prevent hair loss, also extent have, bunch side effects
associated low DHT.

01:06:39 Creatine & DHT/Hair Loss

Along lines particular sports supplement lot people use called
Creatine. Creatine, now lot research showing Creatine can bring
water muscle. can support strength. number things.
Might even important cognitive promoting. Cognitive enhancement effects,
although mild. studies show can significant. people, not
anecdotal, report creatine promotes hair loss. differs individual.
people true, others no. yes appear, based studies able
find PubMed, creatine promote 5-alpha-reductase activity therefore
conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone. makes sense
might promote degree hair loss, well beard growth, well
effects DHT. recall junior high school middle school, going home one Summer
seventh grade, coming back eighth grade kid knew


friends with, went like young kid to, like grown man, full
beard. amazing. like completely transformed. puberty
said before, without doubt accelerated rate development will
go point lives. Even faster infancy just terms huge
number different cognitive changes physical changes. Not surprisingly
individual mostly bald early twenties. must
just exceedingly high levels DHT. also played soccer kid
basically like dribbling past everybody. like grown man, playing soccer
bunch little kids.

01:08:20 Predicting Aging Rates Pubertal Rates

Full beard know, bald 20. rate maturation, rate aging
interesting. hard know rate aging. genetic tests now can allow
that. Things like Horvath Clocks things sort. Beautiful work David
Sinclair Harvard others pointed this. speed entry exit
puberty might be, putting hypothesis. Might interesting
window, fast one going aging developmental arc.
development course, doesn't just start birth end puberty. continues
entire life. think interesting. will often see people, boys girls.
say boys girls, will develop secondary sexual characteristics different rates.
sometimes sequential. know might see kid will, grow tall
big growth spurt, breast development will come little bit later.
features will come little bit later. can also see boys.
person referred earlier, friend developed full beard, know, went
bald. also quite muscular, great athlete. went puberty
exceedingly fast. people go slowly. people will go
puberty age 14, won't start accumulate facial hair much, much later.
voice will change first, early. won't get secondary
sexual characteristics much later. so, don't really know impacts
relates overall trajectory rate aging. interesting thing think
every one us. going offer opportunity experiment
today,



01:10:04 Hyenas, Baseball, & Hypertrophied Clitorises: Androstenedione

listening podcast. first want tell story hyenas,
professional baseball clitoris's size penises. graduate

body, hormones social structure. Hyenas, unlike many species,
situation genitalia male penis actually smaller female
clitoris. say male penis itself, seen fair number hyena
penises, not particularly small. means hyena clitoris's extremely
large. well known time. turns spotted hyenas
females dominant. kill females will eat, young will eat.
male hyenas will eat. well, female hyena gives birth, gives
birth, not vaginal canal accustomed seeing,
enlarged clitoris's like phallus. Although not phallus, clitoris. literally
splits open. many fetuses die course hyena development birth.
animals this, described large giant clitoris.
Although hyena not giant, normal. splits open baby actually
comes through. baby hyena actually comes tissue

familiar work graduate student department first
published work author paper. not main driver

First starts story. researcher still going now. name
Dennis McFadden. believe UT Austin back then. studying

look hearing explore different aspects call
psychophysics hearing understanding hearing thresholds frequency
thresholds. made several observations. observations young
males tended called auto acoustic emissions, often young
females did. Auto acoustic emissions, name suggests, ears actually
making sounds. Now sounds picked special apparatus,
can hear frequency. turns ears don't just take


sound waves convert thing call hearing. also
cases make sound. ears making sounds. Strange right? turns
sex difference auto acoustic emissions. turns also people self-
report lesbians, also auto acoustic emissions significantly
females don't self-report lesbian. Dennis noticed published this.
important discovery one first discoveries pointed
fact sex differences biology independent sex. mean,
hearing auto acoustic emissions. just really illustrate that.
former problem study important? know, lot people

interesting. hard know rate aging. genetic tests now can allow
that. Things like Horvath Clocks things sort. Beautiful work David
Sinclair Harvard others pointed this. speed entry exit
puberty might be, putting hypothesis. Might interesting
window, fast one going aging developmental arc.
development course, doesn't just start birth end puberty. continues
entire life. think interesting. will often see people, boys girls.
say boys girls, will develop secondary sexual characteristics different rates.
sometimes sequential. know might see kid will, grow tall
big growth spurt, breast development will come little bit later.
features will come little bit later. can also see boys.
person referred earlier, friend developed full beard, know, went
bald. also quite muscular, great athlete. went puberty
exceedingly fast. people go slowly. people will go
puberty age 14, won't start accumulate facial hair much, much later.
voice will change first, early. won't get secondary
sexual characteristics much later. so, don't really know impacts
relates overall trajectory rate aging. interesting thing think
every one us. going offer opportunity experiment

situation genitalia male penis actually smaller female
clitoris. say male penis itself, seen fair number hyena
penises, not particularly small. means hyena clitoris's extremely
large. well known time. turns spotted hyenas
females dominant. kill females will eat, young will eat.
male hyenas will eat. well, female hyena gives birth, gives
birth, not vaginal canal accustomed seeing,
enlarged clitoris's like phallus. Although not phallus, clitoris. literally
splits open. many fetuses die course hyena development birth.

Although hyena not giant, normal. splits open baby actually
comes through. baby hyena actually comes tissue

exposure androgens particular utero, impacted whether
not people report homosexual, heterosexual, identify male female.
familiar work graduate student department first
published work author paper. not main driver
work, involved work. certainly know people work.
First starts story. researcher still going now. name
Dennis McFadden. believe UT Austin back then. studying
auditory system. people come clinic would, laboratory.
look hearing explore different aspects call
psychophysics hearing understanding hearing thresholds frequency
thresholds. made several observations. observations young
males tended called auto acoustic emissions, often young
females did. Auto acoustic emissions, name suggests, ears actually
making sounds. Now sounds picked special apparatus,
can hear frequency. turns ears don't just take


sound waves convert thing call hearing. also
cases make sound. ears making sounds. Strange right? turns
sex difference auto acoustic emissions. turns also people self-
report lesbians, also auto acoustic emissions significantly
females don't self-report lesbian. Dennis noticed published this.
important discovery one first discoveries pointed
fact sex differences biology independent sex. mean,
hearing auto acoustic emissions. just really illustrate that.
former problem study important? know, lot people
explored instance whether not, homosexuals lower testosterone instance
males. actually result often opposite. gay men men self-
report gay, often much higher testosterone. studies became
controversial people said, "Well, sexual behavior can relate testosterone," et
cetera. became controversial. studies
attempted look equivalent phenomenon people self report lesbian.
self-report heterosexual. became complicated.

hands." like, [indistinct]. like, "Give hands." pulls ruler
starts measuring fingers. takes couple measurements
goes away. like, "What that?" Well, course Mark
teaching point. soon after, study Mark directed exploring
finger length ratios. explain are. males females,
people self-reported homosexual heterosexual. just get basic,
call sex differences first. averages. want point out. Anytime
get kind topic, people assume causal, not causal.
averages report. case ratio called D2
D4 digits. D2 index finger. thumb D1. D2
index finger point with. Middle finger D3, whatever with.
D4 so-called ring finger. Okay D5 pinky. case D2


D4 ratio greater self-reported females males. mean?
means digit D4 D4 similar length females men males.
effect particularly, excuse me, pronounced right hand. Although not
always, okay? not handedness. D2 D4 difference
measured correctly. can't just look somebody hands say, "Oh,
ring finger index finger similar. therefore female
know. exposed little testosterone utero." can't look
somebody see index finger much shorter ring finger say,
"Oh, must've exposed lot androgen." actually measure
measure correctly. measure base finger
first crease, way tip past the. can't include

look back hand sometimes can see it. know, case
instance. Let see can this. D4 little bit longer D2.
people pronounced right hand. hand,
difference actually far less pronounced. little bit. little bit pronounced
there, not much okay? sort typical ratio see.
turns mice humans, androgen exposed

pointer finger. females exposed less androgen
utero typically. fingers tend equal length. subtle
differences averages. invite look paper. published
Nature 2000 replicated six times. Now, gets even
interesting. potentially precarious, going step cautiously here. look
finger length ratios men self-report homosexual, either
typical male pattern D2 D4 ratio hyper masculinized D4 D2 ratio. Now
can't something established modified behavior. something
established utero. fact, present birth okay? completely
divorces interactions hormones behavior. important
theme talking about. going talk even more. Next
episode hormones impact behavior behavior also impact hormones.
case hormones impacting really considered primary sexual
characteristic. doesn't show puberty, shows puberty.


actually established utero. people self-reported lesbians. remember
going collecting data with, collaborators work. Again,
wasn't main driver work. participated analysis. People
self-report lesbians also tend smaller D2 D4 ratio.
consistent auto acoustic emission study Dennis McFadden published.
points fact early exposure androgens may impact, not just
androgenization body plan, also separately sexual preference. Now,
raises sorts interesting questions biological basis sexual preference.

01:29:13 Brain Dimorphisms Sexual Orientation

tell another study. guy named Simon LeVay UCLA.
trained Hubel Wiesel. remember early episodes "Plasticy,"
David Hubel Torsten Wiesel scientific great-grandparents won Nobel Prize
discovery critical periods brain plasticity. defined
important aspects see brain plasticity. Simon LeVay trained them.
Simon went discover brains people self-report
homosexual brain difference. brain difference area called
Interstitial Nucleus Anterior Hypothalamus. INAH.
published reports. published Science. work refer published
Nature, replicated no fewer six times. McFadden results
point strong biological correlates mate choice, sexual preference. tie
directly things like androgenization estrogenization. Meaning call
maleness femaleness, sort tricky territory. way
described huge range sex can defined earlier. So, want
measure D2 D4 ratio welcome to, also understand
not predictive anything, right? just window possible androgen exposure
early life. plenty men report
heterosexual similar D2 D4 ratios females.
plenty females whose index fingers shorter ring fingers.
perfectly happy say perfectly happy. inclined
believe heterosexual. variation. fact, Mark tells really good
joke. want know whether not somebody homosexual heterosexual,
simply look hands, look D2 D4 ratio guess heterosexual.


right 96% time. 96% time people report
heterosexual average. numbers might changing. joke really joke
science because, falls within realm statistical significance. yet really
illustrates fact none causal. nonetheless interesting
means hormones organizing brain early development ways
can potentially impact opposite sex partner choice later life. Now
course, things can impact opposite sex same-sex partner choice
later life. study not look people reported bisexual.

hasn't lot studies yet. One thing interesting,
good scientific data also controversy that, appears

brother even 10 older brothers, sure self-report
homosexual. statistically becomes likely somebody will
successive older brother have. idea starting emerge,

many male fetuses carried, male fetuses secreting certain
things, dihydrotestosterone, things, can feed back genome.
epigenomic effects onto placenta itself, higher

friends with, went like young kid to, like grown man, full
beard. amazing. like completely transformed. puberty
said before, without doubt accelerated rate development will
go point lives. Even faster infancy just terms huge
number different cognitive changes physical changes. Not surprisingly
individual mostly bald early twenties. must
just exceedingly high levels DHT. also played soccer kid
basically like dribbling past everybody. like grown man, playing soccer
bunch little kids.

01:08:20 Predicting Aging Rates Pubertal Rates

Full beard know, bald 20. rate maturation, rate aging
interesting. hard know rate aging. genetic tests now can allow
that. Things like Horvath Clocks things sort. Beautiful work David
Sinclair Harvard others pointed this. speed entry exit
puberty might be, putting hypothesis. Might interesting
window, fast one going aging developmental arc.
development course, doesn't just start birth end puberty. continues
entire life. think interesting. will often see people, boys girls.
say boys girls, will develop secondary sexual characteristics different rates.
sometimes sequential. know might see kid will, grow tall
big growth spurt, breast development will come little bit later.
features will come little bit later. can also see boys.
person referred earlier, friend developed full beard, know, went
bald. also quite muscular, great athlete. went puberty
exceedingly fast. people go slowly. people will go
puberty age 14, won't start accumulate facial hair much, much later.
voice will change first, early. won't get secondary
sexual characteristics much later. so, don't really know impacts
relates overall trajectory rate aging. interesting thing think
every one us. going offer opportunity experiment

raises sorts interesting questions biological basis sexual preference.

01:29:13 Brain Dimorphisms Sexual Orientation

tell another study. guy named Simon LeVay UCLA.

described huge range sex can defined earlier. So, want
measure D2 D4 ratio welcome to, also understand
not predictive anything, right? just window possible androgen exposure

heterosexual similar D2 D4 ratios females.
plenty females whose index fingers shorter ring fingers.
perfectly happy say perfectly happy. inclined
believe heterosexual. variation. fact, Mark tells really good
joke. want know whether not somebody homosexual heterosexual,
simply look hands, look D2 D4 ratio guess heterosexual.


right 96% time. 96% time people report
heterosexual average. numbers might changing. joke really joke
science because, falls within realm statistical significance. yet really
illustrates fact none causal. nonetheless interesting
means hormones organizing brain early development ways
